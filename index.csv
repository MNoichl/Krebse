							CHICAGO - Women with a high genetic risk for breast cancer run a better chance of having it detected with magnetic resonance imaging than with mammography and other methods, researchers said Tuesday.

advertisement
The kind of breast cancer involved is caused by mutations of the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, believed responsible for 5 percent to 10 percent of all breast cancer cases. Women with the mutations have a significantly higher risk of breast cancer.

Researchers at Canada?s Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre said they studied 236 women with the mutations aged 25 to 65 who underwent annual screenings from 1997 to 2003 using all methods.

They found that 17 cancers in the group were detected by MRI compared to eight by mammography, seven by ultrasound and two by semiannual clinical breast examinations.

?Our results support the position that MRI-based screening is likely to become the cornerstone of breast cancer surveillance for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, but it is necessary to demonstrate that this surveillance tool lowers breast cancer mortality before it can be recommended for general use,? the report added.

The study was published in this week?s Journal of the American Medical Association which also carried an editorial by two researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

The findings combined with another recent study ?strongly suggest that women with (these) mutations should be offered such screening,? the commentary said.

But it said women and their doctors should be aware that the results of such screening ?may be substantially less than described if different imaging protocols are followed or if experienced radiologists and suitable technology, including the capability to perform magnetic resonance-guided biopsies, are not available.?

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - While supportive care to relieve symptoms is now the standard of care at the end of life, a new study shows that a ""sizeable proportion"" of breast cancer patients nearing death do not have access to such treatment, also referred to as palliative care.

""Palliative care has been shown to improve quality of life of dying patients with cancer,"" Dr. Bruno Gagnon from Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal told Reuters Health. ""Unfortunately, this study demonstrates that women dying of breast cancer had limited access to such care, especially the younger ones. ""

Gagnon and colleagues analyzed the pattern of care at the end of life for 2,291 women terminally ill with breast cancer and found that the majority (75 percent) did not receive palliative care during the last six months of life.

""Very few"" (6.9 percent) died at home, Gagnon said. More than two thirds (69.6 percent) died in acute care hospital beds.

This low rate of home deaths is ""striking,"" the investigators report in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, and may be explained by the high level of accessibility to hospital beds in Quebec province, the site of the study.

Age was a factor in the receipt of palliative care. Women younger than age 50 were less likely to receive palliative care at the end of life than were women in middle age, while women older than 70 were the most likely to receive palliative care.

Commenting on these findings, Gagnon said: ""The prevention of suffering is an integrated part of cancer control. Health care policies for end-of-life care should seriously promote health services for the terminally ill in view of preventing undue suffering.""

Carbohydrates are the hot topic in dieting circles ? the Atkins diet has consigned them to the back of the kitchen cupboard because of their purported role in weight gain. A new report in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention (1 August 2004) now links high carbohydrate intake with breast cancer. ""This study raises important questions about high carbohydrate diets"", said study co-author Walter Willet (Scientific American, 9 August 2004). In fact, this case?control study of the dietary habits of 1,866 Mexican women found that those who acquired more than 62 percent of their calories from carbohydrates were 2.2 times more likely to develop breast cancer.

However, scientists have been quick to warn against premature conclusions: ""You cannot make generalizations about 'carbohydrates', because the category contains an enormous variety of foods that have vastly different nutritional profiles and vastly different effects on the body"", stated Ritva Butrum on the American Institute for Cancer Research web site (6 August 2004).

As the authors themselves remark, ""the main carbohydrates these women ate were corn-derived, including tortillas, and soft drinks and bread"" (CNN.com, 6 August 2004). These highly processed, 'refined' carbohydrates lack the insoluble fibre, vitamin and folate content of 'unrefined' carbohydrate sources such as vegetables and fruits. This distinction is an important one, as the study results also indicate that consumption of insoluble fibre is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. So, rather than instigating a blanket policy against all carbohydrates, perhaps we should simply be choosing our carbohydrate sources more carefully.

							WASHINGTON - Doctors may be overdoing it a bit on colonoscopies, a procedure to screen for colon cancer using a tiny camera, even though they can save lives, researchers reported Monday

advertisement
Patients who had a low-risk polyp removed in a first colonoscopy do not need to have repeat colonoscopies as often as many doctors are prescribing them, the researchers report in this week's issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.

""We believe colonoscopy can be a life-saving procedure, but it shouldn't be done more often than necessary,"" said Dr. Pauline Mysliwiec, an assistant professor of gastroenterology at the University of California Davis.

""When it's used inappropriately, it strains health care resources and puts patients at unnecessary risk.""

Colonoscopies involve threading a tiny camera through the rectum into the colon and are the most accurate way to screen for colon cancer. People over 50 are advised to undergo the procedure every 10 years.

The American Cancer Society estimates that 147,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer this year and 57,000 will die from the disease.

Mysliwiec and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute surveyed gastroenterologists and general surgeons about their colonoscopy recommendations in 1999 and 2000.

Medical guidelines on how often patients should have a follow-up colonoscopy do not call for surveillance after removal of a hyperplastic polyp, a benign growth not believed to become cancerous.

People with such growths should only have the recommended colonoscopy every 10 years after age 50.

Yet they found that 24 percent of the gastroenterologists and 54 percent of the general surgeons surveyed recommended surveillance colonoscopy every three to five years for a small, hyperplastic polyp.

""Overuse of colonoscopy taxes the health care system and may compromise the quality of care,"" the researchers wrote.

""Long waiting times of several months are already occurring in some parts of the country and could mean reduced access for symptomatic patients and those with limited means.""

A colonoscopy costs between $1,500 to $1,700 in the United States.

New recommendations on chemotherapy
In a second report, the American Society of Clinical Oncology issued new recommendations saying patients who have been successfully operated on for stage II colon cancer do not need any chemotherapy.

Writing in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, they said patients who get chemotherapy after surgery have only about a 4 percent to 5 percent greater chance of survival five years after surgery, compared with patients who had surgery alone.

""It is critical for each patient to weigh the risk of therapy and any potential benefit,"" said Dr. Al Benson, director of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center's Clinical Investigations Program at Northwestern University.

CHICAGO - Men with prostate cancer that doesn?t appear to have spread have better survival chances when they get short-term hormone treatment along with standard radiation, rather than radiation alone, a small study found.

advertisement
click here
Almost five years after treatment, six men in the radiation-only study group died of prostate cancer; none of the men who got combined treatment died of prostate cancer. The study involved about 200 men.

Of the more than 200,000 U.S. men diagnosed each year with the disease, nearly half have the kind cancer involved in the study: An exam and imaging indicates it hasn?t spread but other tests indicate it might have.

Likely to become prevalent
Treatment for such men often involves radiation alone or radiation combined with long-term use of hormone-fighting drugs, often for as long as three years or more. But long-term drug use may cause thinning bones, heart abnormalities that can lead to sudden death and impaired mental function.

?It?s a very important and useful study and should have nearly immediate impact on the fashion in which men are treated.?

? Dr. Durado Brooks
American Cancer Society
The study found that using hormone-blocking drugs for six months had the same survival benefits as long-term use but without the potential health risks. Some men did have side effects including impotence, but that can occur with other prostate cancer treatments, including surgery and radiation.

?It?s a very important and useful study and should have nearly immediate impact on the fashion in which men are treated,? said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer programs at the American Cancer Society.

?Significant numbers of men are getting radiation only,? Brooks said. That?s partly because many men reject hormone-suppressing drugs when they learn about all the bad side effects from long-term treatment, he said.

Brooks said radiation plus short-term medication is likely to become prevalent given the study results.

Researchers studied 206 men aged 49 to 82 randomly assigned to receive about seven weeks of daily radiation treatments, or radiation plus six months of medication overlapping the radiation treatment. Six of those only on radiation died from prostate cancer while none of those getting combined treatment died from prostate cancer.

More than twice as many radiation-only men had evidence of cancer recurrence, 46 versus 21 in the combined treatment group.

The study by researchers at Boston?s Brigham and Women?s Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute appears in Wednesday?s Journal of the American Medical Association.

The patients had prostate cancer that physical exams and imaging tests indicated had not spread. But they also had high blood levels of PSA ? prostate specific antigen ? and high Gleason scores, which measure the degree of abnormality found in cancer tissue.

The high levels raise the possibility of cancer elsewhere, said lead author Dr. Anthony D?Amico, a radiation oncologist at both institutions.

The drug treatment studied involved flutamide pills three times daily with periodic injections of either leuprolide acetate or goserelin. The drugs suppress production of testosterone, which can fuel prostate cancer growth.

Men in the drug-radiation group had more severe impotence and more breast tissue enlargement than the radiation only group. But they had no obvious evidence of the potentially more debilitating complications of long-term treatment. Although those weren?t specifically measured, they usually don?t appear until after at least a year of treatment, D?Amico said.

In a JAMA editorial, Dr. Thomas DeWeese of Johns Hopkins University, said the study did not address how the drug treatment affected patients? quality of life. He also said the radiation dose was lower than is frequently given, which might explain the differing survival rates.

Still, he called the study ?extremely important? because of the survival advantage shown.

The patients had prostate cancer that physical exams and imaging tests indicated had not spread. But they also had high blood levels of PSA ? prostate specific antigen ? and high Gleason scores, which measure the degree of abnormality found in cancer tissue.

The high levels raise the possibility of cancer elsewhere, said lead author Dr. Anthony D?Amico, a radiation oncologist at both institutions.

The drug treatment studied involved flutamide pills three times daily with periodic injections of either leuprolide acetate or goserelin. The drugs suppress production of testosterone, which can fuel prostate cancer growth.

Men in the drug-radiation group had more severe impotence and more breast tissue enlargement than the radiation only group. But they had no obvious evidence of the potentially more debilitating complications of long-term treatment. Although those weren?t specifically measured, they usually don?t appear until after at least a year of treatment, D?Amico said.

In a JAMA editorial, Dr. Thomas DeWeese of Johns Hopkins University, said the study did not address how the drug treatment affected patients? quality of life. He also said the radiation dose was lower than is frequently given, which might explain the differing survival rates.

Still, he called the study ?extremely important? because of the survival advantage shown.

							Yes, I agree. My Mom is dying of cancer- she is down to her last few days, but we still find reasons to laugh. My Mom's one request has been for us to give her marajuana to help with her pain.  I can't help but laugh a little to watch my parents smoke a joint together- something I never thought I would see. Although, they did grow up in the 60s and 70s.  There is a great irony to life. Along with the pain and the tears, there is always  love and laughter.  Life, and death, is amazingly beautiful.

							Dear Guest,

You sound as if you are in lots of pain and I'm very sorry about that.  

I don't think anyone is saying that you should not take cancer seriously.  I, too. lost loved ones.  I lost my dad to lung cancer and my mom had breast cancer.  I just finished treatments for invasive breast cancer.

However, humor and a positive attitude got me through the stress.  Yes, my husband and I have made jokes about my cancer.  It's the only way I could get through the treatments.  I remember my dad used to make jokes, too.  It worked for him.  Sometimes we just have to do what works for us.  No, a positive attitude won't cure someone, but it will make it easier to get through each day.  And each day will have a better quality of life.

I don't think anyone would trivialize cancer.  Laughter is just one coping mechanism that works for us.

							Yes, cancer does need to be taken seriously. I think the trick is to not let cancer take over your life. It is a horrible, horrible thing, but try to also see the good things in life.  Our loved ones who are suffering or who we have lost would want us to still find reasons to laugh and smile. The pain will always be there. We will always miss them. But, as much as we may not want it to, life goes on.  I lost my Mom two weeks ago. My brother's wedding was a week later. As hard as it was, we all still celebrated his marriage as my Mom would have wanted.  During her final days, we smiled and laughed as much as we cried. We didn't laugh at the cancer or her sickness, but at the irony of life and as a way of letting go of some of the stress that was building up in us.

							Hi,

I'm so sorry about  your dad.  My dad also had lung cancer which had metastasized to the brain and other organs.  He was in the ICU for a few weeks before he died.  

The only thing I can suggest is to talk to others about your feelings.  Maybe a minister or priest?  While I was undergoing my cancer treatments my hospital had a cancer support group that met twice a month in the evenings.  It wasn't exclusively for the patients.....family members of the patient were also welcomed.  It was moderated by the hospital social worker.  Everyone was welcome.  I would suggest that you call your local hospital and ask if they provide this service.  I believe that most  hospitals do.  It really does help to talk to others in a similar experience.

If you can't do that maybe an online support group, such as this one?  The lung cancer section hasn't really taken off yet, but there is a Living with Cancer one at ivillage.  Lots of people are posting there.

Hope this helps.  Prayers to you and your dad.

What he said. Screen more often, but don't let it worry you excessively. In a sense, knowing you are higher risk is a blessing in disguise, since you are more likely to catch anything early, while it is much more curable. Those of us with no family history or risk factors often don't find out until the tumor is big, nasty, and spreading.

							My surgeon, Professor Parvaiz when asked by my son if he was at increased risk since I was diagnosed with colon cancer said. 
Slight but unquantifiable higher risk, but if son hadn't got it by the age of 40 (which he hasnt) then 2 yearly colonoscopies from the age of 50 should be sufficient. If after 3 consecutive clear colonoscopies then don't worry.

By Kim Dixon and Ransdell Pierson

CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When it comes to the price tag for the newest biotechology drugs for cancer and other hard-to-treat diseases, the sky is likely to remain the limit, insurers, drugmakers and industry watchers say.

Neither HMOs nor the government-sponsored Medicare program is seriously challenging unprecedented costs for the new drugs, which include rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis treatments.

While these new drugs now serve only a narrow population, a stream of other pricey biotech medicines will steadily be launched to serve an aging U.S. population. Their toll on insurers and Medicare could then explode.

Among the new breed of drugs are AstraZeneca Plc's $1,700-a-month Iressa pill for lung cancer and Genentech's injectable Avastin for colon cancer at $4,400 a month.

""There's a public perception that if a drug does any good, we're entitled to have it,"" said Ira Loss, an analyst for independent research firm Washington Analysis. ""That means the future costs of providing drugs to the elderly will likely far exceed"" Medicare spending forecasts.

ImClone Systems Inc.'s colon cancer drug, Erbitux, commands about $10,000 per month yet has not been shown to prolong the lives of the desperately ill patients for whom it is approved.

Avastin prolonged the lives of colon cancer victims by about five months in clinical trials, while Erbitux only shrank tumors in clinical trials but still provided some hope as a last ditch treatment.

Older drugs have typically been made of chemicals that are easy and relatively inexpensive to mass produce.

Many biotech drugs, however, are laboratory-altered, naturally occurring proteins that are expensive and complicated to produce and must be injected. Even so, their prices have sparked controversy.

BLACKMAIL?

""Companies are charging whatever they want to extend your life a few months; it's like blackmail,"" said Shaojing Tong, a Mehta Partners analyst who predicted the government may eventually intervene to force down prices.

Tong said insurers are also facing costs of up to $20,000 a year for new injectable treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, including Amgen Inc.'s Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade.

One of the most promising cancer drugs in development is Tarceva, an OSI Pharmaceuticals pill found to extend the lives of lung cancer patients by two months in clinical trials, and to lengthen the lives of patients with pancreatic cancer by two weeks.

OSI Chief Executive Colin Goddard said Tarceva's price will likely mirror that of similar therapies on the market, such as Novartis' leukemia treatment Gleevec, which carries a $2,200 monthly price tag.

""We have to measure these drugs' benefit to society against how we spend money on other things,"" Goddard said, addressing the healthcare system's ability to bear such costs.

Medicare, the federal health plan for the elderly and disabled, is covering most of these new drugs. As the biggest buyer of pharmaceuticals, it spends $5 billion a year on drugs, most of them injectable ones.

NO BALKING -- YET

The new treatments haven't broken the bank yet because they are still used by a limited number of patients.

""The question of covering Gleevec and Avastin and Erbitux is certainly going to get people's attention and this is going to be a real Medicare budget issue,"" said Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society.

Private insurers do not yet appear to be balking at reimbursement either, mindful that consumers expect access to drugs that provide hope regardless of the cost.

But they are not happy about it.

""When a patient gets a $1,000 (treatment) for a $20 co-payment, that is something that concerns us,"" said Winston Wong, chief pharmacy officer at CareFirst, a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in Maryland with 3.2 million members.

Many of these treatments are so new it remains unclear what their real benefits may be. And perhaps much more study needs to be done to correctly identify and target just which patients are likely to be helped by them as a way of curtailing soaring costs to the healthcare system.

But for now, says William Fleming, chief pharmacy officer for Humana Inc., in many cases, ""we are going on hope.""
						

"
"


							I am currently undergoing chemtherapy using a Roche product called Xeloda (capecitabine).  One cycle of treatments (28 treatment days) costs just about $2200, which does seem awfully high.  Note, however, that this is orally administered, as opposed to the 5-FU based drugs it replaces, which had to be infused using a daily IV.  

In this case, it turns out that a costly orally-administered drug costs less overall than one which must be infused, even if the infused drug were available for free.  Infusion is a costly process, in both time and hospital resources, and that cost has been eliminated.

Certainly, I would prefer that the Xeloda were inexpensive.  The shocked look on the young pharmacist's face when the bill topped $2000 was amusing to see, as seemingly no one can just pay such prices.  And yet what is the alternative?  I do not have a co-payment based insurance plan, and so I see the full costs at the time of purchase.  I suppose that I could just not be treated, which it would seem that the insurance industry would prefer.  However, since I intend to survive this bout with cancer, after paying the hospital, surgeon, and associated folks $75,000 to cut the tumor out, failing to pay the $6,600 for the final pill bill to make sure it doesn't come back would seem irrational.
						

"
"


							The price has nothing to do with how much it costs to produce the stuff.   They basically sell it for as much as they possibly can.  Pharmaceuticals sell the same drugs in different countries at very, very different prices. 

I've compared prices for brand-name cancer drugs here in Chile with online drugstores (even Canadian ones) and they're much cheaper here.  The Vesanoid I took was made in Switzerland by Roche and was identical to the same stuff sold in the U.S. and Canada for a lot more.

							Washington -- Cancer survivors experience a poorer quality of life than do people who have never been diagnosed with cancer, according to a new study. The finding was true even for those who survived more than 10 years after their diagnosis.

""I was surprised,"" said lead author Robin Yabroff, PhD, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute. ""We have some follow-up studies in the pipeline to try to understand it a little bit better.""

The study was published in the Sept. 1 Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

More and more people will likely be living with cancer in the near future as a result of earlier detection and more effective treatments. One million people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer this year, and that number is expected to double by 2050 as the population increases and ages.

The researchers studied data collected in the 2000 National Health Interview Survey, an annual survey that asks respondents questions about their lives and health. They analyzed responses from more than 1,800 cancer survivors and nearly 5,500 control subjects matched for age, gender and level of education.

They found that cancer survivors were more likely to describe their health as poor or fair than were those who had never been diagnosed with cancer. Survivors were also more likely to report being unable to work because of their illness or to have lost more days of work due to illness during the previous year. The finding was true for all types of cancer and regardless of how many years had passed since the cancer was diagnosed.

The breadth of the data analyzed meant that some of the depth was sacrificed, said William F. Lawrence, MD, senior fellow in outcomes research at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, who is also an author of the study. ""So we can say that in the population there is a burden of illness in cancer survivors, but we don't know why,"" said Dr. Lawrence. ""I'm sure the reasons will be different for different people.""

A mixed review
Some people may have had a recurrence of their cancer while the poor health of others may be attributable to the residual effects of their cancer treatment, said the researchers. For example, they note that several studies have found that men undergoing surgery for localized prostate cancer may continue to experience incontinence and impotence after their initial treatment.

The main message to physicians who care for cancer patients is to know that this burden of illness persists, said Dr. Lawrence. ""Clinicians need to ask their patients about how cancer impacts on their life overall and explore with the individual patient a way they can be helped.""

1 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in 2004.  
But Deborah Armstrong, MD, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins' School of Medicine, said it wasn't surprising that people who are diagnosed with cancer have more problems with work and finances than those never diagnosed with cancer.

""It might have been fairer to compare these patients with those who have had a history of heart disease or diabetes."" The researchers may then have tried to determine whether people with a history of cancer are more productive or have a better overall outcome compared with those with heart disease, for example, she said.

While it's always good to have the data, she said, the findings may not be beneficial to cancer patients. ""I worry that people who have a diagnosis of cancer will have more trouble getting insurance or getting a job. I'm not sure it's going to have a positive outcome.""

Bonnie Teschendorf, PhD, director of Quality of Life Science at the American Cancer Society, agreed that the fact that cancer survivors face greater burdens in their lives is not surprising, but she praised the study. ""This is a very important study to begin to characterize what happens to people after they have left their treatment. It shows what happens in their lives after that,"" she said. ""Once people leave medical care, it is more difficult to track them and find out what has happened and how it has impacted their lives.""

The value of this study also comes, in part, from its national data, which are not easy to gather, she said.

Interest in the quality of life of the 9.8 million cancer survivors in the nation has increased over the past two or three years, she noted. The cancer society stepped up its attention to this population about two years ago with a special project.

There is also an effort to develop clinics that provide follow-up care to former cancer patients, and the new findings will provide an idea of who needs services and what those services might be, Dr. Teschendorf said.

							Dr. Leo, 
My mother passed away 4 years ago this month.   She was diagnosed with breast cancer and lung cancer.   The operated and removed one of her breast and a pie section from her lung.     She was told there were three lymth nodes from the breast which had cancer cells.  She went thru the rounds of chemo therapy.    About 18 months later they found out she had a brain tumor.    She under went lazer therapy for the brain tumor(sept 30).  They said she had two months to two years to live.   She died within the two months.    She wanted to die at home.   She got hospice  to come in and check on her.   They did a great job.   She would not allow me to come to take care of her till she got were she really needed me.   I went home on nov 7th and she passed away nov 29.   She was cremated dec 4th.   I was flying from texas to missouri every other weekend before i went there full time.      

They said that the brain tumor traveled from the lung to the brain.    The  doctors office had lost her scan they didn of her body(mnr?)  No one would tell her she had the cancer back in her lungs until she went to the emergency room and the emergency room doctor told her.     My mother was 65 when she passed away.

The hard part about this for me, is a year after her death we find out the pharmist in kansas city, Courtney...diluted her chemo medications.    He is in prison for the rest of his life.     But, how can someone be so greedy to distroy over 300 people's lives for money.    He killed hundreds of people with his greediness.    If it wasn't for him, she might still be here.

This time of the year is hard for me..I just wanted to let you know i respected my mother's wishes, she wanted to die at home.   I am glad for the time we had together.   We got to say things to each other that i will always carry in my heart.  It wasn't easy and i still have nightmares from that time.    I sometimes feel like I didn't do everything I could have done for her.   But i tried my best (I worked as a nurses aid when i graduated from high school - that training came in very handy).

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Infection with simian virus 40 (SV40) plays little or no role in the development of mesothelioma, a cancer affecting the lining of the lungs that has been linked to asbestos exposure, according to a report in The Lancet.

In the 1950s and 1960s, several hundred thousand military recruits in the US received a vaccine contaminated with SV40. Since then, concerns have been raised that SV40 may cause cancer after researchers noticed the presence of its DNA in various tumor specimens.

However, the new results indicate that the SV40 DNA seen in these specimens may have simply resulted from contamination in the lab -- the virus was not actually present in the tumor before it was removed from the patient.

The current findings are just the latest in a series of reports that have failed to show a link between SV40 and various cancers, such as mesothelioma, lymphoma, and brain tumors.

In the study, Dr. Marc Ladanyi and colleagues, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, looked for SV40 DNA in 71 mesothelioma samples.

The authors found no evidence of genuine SV40 DNA in the tumor specimens. They did, however, find SV40 DNA that came from circular molecules called plasmids, not from the virus itself. The researchers suggest that these plasmids were probably introduced as contaminants in the lab.

""Because SV40 appears unlikely to have a major role, if any, in human mesotheliomas, (doctors) should continue to consider asbestos exposure as the most likely and most thoroughly established (cause) in individuals with this cancer,"" the researchers conclude.

I would be interested to hear from another AML patient who has had a similar situation.  I read that for a bone marrow transplant to have a chance to work (albeit 60% chance), it must be done within the first year of a the AML patient's remission.  Is that right?

For long-term survival for AML the best therapy is a bone marrow transplant, There are a lot of risks related to that, and this has to be weighed against other options. Some experts recommend BMT right away if possible, but that depends on characteristics of the disease.

At, first it was really rough, He stayed in the hospital for about 6 mths. when we first found out.He was really sick, we didnt think he was going to make it, but he was strong. He had a bone marrow transplant and he is better. He just started back taking chemo, and he has to take it for four weeks,once a week. We sit there for six hours, and then he is sick and sometimes he is just tired.The side effects are different. I heard that after you only live up to five years with this disease. Is this true?

							Leo -- you are fantastic.  This site is an EXTREMELY good idea.  I hope it will work wonderfully.  I am here from having heard from you at the Yahoo Breast Cancer Survivor Network website.

Since you are a doctor, I was wondering if you could try to answer this:
I had a left mastectomy on Sept. 2, 2004.  They also removed the sentinel node and a few other nodes from under my arm (all negative--I'm lucky.)  A drainage tube was left in and removed on the 12th day after surgery.  When removed, it was still draining 40 mg. of blood every day.  They thought it was left in long enough and removed it.  Though everything is healing nicely, there is a large, very hard lump under my arm (like a small extra breast).  Should I be in touch with the surgeon's office to maybe have this aspirated?  Or is it normal?  Thank you.

First of all, thanks for your comments. I need everyone's help to disseminate the existence of this forum. I will be having more colleagues join me here to help answer questions.

Anyway, about your question. It is very hard to know exactly your situation. I don't know what type of cancer it is, the stage. But assuming it is early breast cancer, which was completely removed and negative nodes, even if you had a local recurrence it would be extremely early. What happened almost for sure is the development of a seroma, or a small cavity containing serum, or fluid. It may get larger and perforate spontaneously. You should have this seen, and you might need drainage once again. This is not too uncommon, but it definitely needs care. I can not consider this normal, but a small complication of the surgical procedure.

							Dear Dr. Leo:

Thanks for the drainage tube information -- I had thought it was mostly normal but will see to it.  

You are wonderful to try this kind of a site.  I hope you don't get  stuck with all the questions women don't have quite the chance to ask their doctors.  Are you prepared for the deluge?  You mentioned having other doctors, etc. help you.  It would be.....revolutionary if we could come here and just ask these things that boggle and prey upon our minds!  

Someone on my support website was asking about getting her complete breast cancer pathology report explained with her actual survival rate.  This is what we all want to know, for example.  Would you have a pathologist in mind who would do this?  (I won't talk it up too much if you ask me not to, so you have a chance to get ready.) 

Hope this didn't discourage you!
Thanks again,
Janie

As you know,  pathologists have their own terms. Personally I don't think that pathological details play a big role in survival. That's why the clinical stages were invented. To guide treatment and somehow categorize groups of patients in survival groups. That allows us to compare groups of patients with the same disease and different methods of treatment. I'd advise to try to not be to detailed about your labs, tests and reports. Leave that for the physicians who do that on a regular basis. I think that this may just bring more anxiety into context.  It's like when you go to the machanic and ask him to explain exactly how he replaced part X, which parts had to be taken out of the way etc. In the end, what you really want to know is: which part was broken, how was it fixed in general terms, and how much it costs, if it may happen again and so forth.

You see, cancer is such a difficult disease to deal with, in my consultations I'd rather spend more time discussing how the patient and physician can work together to fight the disease, instead of explaining very difficult concepts that may not be of use at all to the patient.

Again, thanks for your support.  You can let all your friends know about this. I'll be here

							Janie - If there's fluid gathering somewhere after removal of your drain, it could be lymph fluid. Just in case your docs haven't mentioned lymphedema, you might want to read up on it. You can go to www.lymphnet.org for more info. 

While oftentimes doctors don't think you're at risk if you only had a few nodes removed... the fact is that any change in the lymph system could put you at risk for lymphedema. While it may be mild lymphedema... it's always good to understand the risks, and what could cause it to flare up.

							Hi
My father was recently diagnosed with liver cancer, and he is not a surgical candidate. I heard that tissue ablation can be done. What is the best hospital to go for this procedure in the US ??

thanks

There are so many good hospitals that can do this. Take a look at Cancer Centers close to you. I think MD Anderson, Memorial Sloan-Kettering and Mayo Clinic should all be excellent places for this, but there are certainly several others.
