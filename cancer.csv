You are a treasure and I surely wish you were in San Diego.

I am a breast cancer survivor and I work with Scripps Clinic as a ""Breast Buddy"" to newly diagnosed BC patients.

This is a great system, if and when you ever need to set one up.  Pairing up people with like chronic ailments.  My dear husband could sure have used a friend when he was diagnosed with heart disease at 48.  He went into a severe depression and I was so worried.

Anyway, thank you for being who you are, an asset to all of us and a credit to your profession!

							Dear Leo, This site seems a dream come true!!
Thank you VERY much!!
We have ""so much going on"" that we're not familiar with, and would love a doctor to comment on.
For myself, I was dx with IDC last July, lumpectomy, tumor .8 cm, highly invasiive, er+, had already invaded my sentinal node (9others clear)
I started A/C+Taxotere last October, rads last April.
Now here I am, a mass of aches and pains that no NSAID or Cox2s can help.
Wondering why?
An d when it will all disappear.
So, I'm very, very delighted to be offered this site!
Thank you!!
Gotta run now, but will be back to read, and ask.

PS-being a doctor at Mayo Clinic, you are super-wonderful to be thinking of relating to your patients so thoroughly. I know the masses of information must be mind-boggling, so that most oncs can just about kn ow all of it, w/out knowing what their patients feel, and why.

I'm sure your message at breastcancer.org will garner lots of interest in this new site. There's much to like here and I plan to return often. I am amazed that you have time to get involved with this project, but I think you will learn so much while helping us with questions.

I started on my breast cancer journey last January. Neoadjuvant chemo, mastectomy, radiation and now femara. So many of us go from relatively healthy folk to constant rounds of tests, doctor visits, questions left unanswered, and uncertainty. 

I applaud your efforts.

I don't even know what to say. Your words are so kind... Anyway, I am seeing we are building a nice community here. I hope more and more people come. I have been talking to colleagues about joining me in answering your questions... for now I can keep up with the pace, but I am seeing that we will definitely need more people. 

If any of you can help by moderating a forum, please e-mail me. There is nothing like getting to know nice people. The one thing that strikes me all the time is that cancer patients are 99% of the time very good people. I don't know why, it's just the way it is...

							CHICAGO - Women with a high genetic risk for breast cancer run a better chance of having it detected with magnetic resonance imaging than with mammography and other methods, researchers said Tuesday.

advertisement
The kind of breast cancer involved is caused by mutations of the genes BRCA1 and BRCA2, believed responsible for 5 percent to 10 percent of all breast cancer cases. Women with the mutations have a significantly higher risk of breast cancer.

Researchers at Canada?s Toronto-Sunnybrook Regional Cancer Centre said they studied 236 women with the mutations aged 25 to 65 who underwent annual screenings from 1997 to 2003 using all methods.

They found that 17 cancers in the group were detected by MRI compared to eight by mammography, seven by ultrasound and two by semiannual clinical breast examinations.

?Our results support the position that MRI-based screening is likely to become the cornerstone of breast cancer surveillance for BRCA1 and BRCA2 mutation carriers, but it is necessary to demonstrate that this surveillance tool lowers breast cancer mortality before it can be recommended for general use,? the report added.

The study was published in this week?s Journal of the American Medical Association which also carried an editorial by two researchers at Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York.

The findings combined with another recent study ?strongly suggest that women with (these) mutations should be offered such screening,? the commentary said.

But it said women and their doctors should be aware that the results of such screening ?may be substantially less than described if different imaging protocols are followed or if experienced radiologists and suitable technology, including the capability to perform magnetic resonance-guided biopsies, are not available.?

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - While supportive care to relieve symptoms is now the standard of care at the end of life, a new study shows that a ""sizeable proportion"" of breast cancer patients nearing death do not have access to such treatment, also referred to as palliative care.

""Palliative care has been shown to improve quality of life of dying patients with cancer,"" Dr. Bruno Gagnon from Royal Victoria Hospital in Montreal told Reuters Health. ""Unfortunately, this study demonstrates that women dying of breast cancer had limited access to such care, especially the younger ones. ""

Gagnon and colleagues analyzed the pattern of care at the end of life for 2,291 women terminally ill with breast cancer and found that the majority (75 percent) did not receive palliative care during the last six months of life.

""Very few"" (6.9 percent) died at home, Gagnon said. More than two thirds (69.6 percent) died in acute care hospital beds.

This low rate of home deaths is ""striking,"" the investigators report in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, and may be explained by the high level of accessibility to hospital beds in Quebec province, the site of the study.

Age was a factor in the receipt of palliative care. Women younger than age 50 were less likely to receive palliative care at the end of life than were women in middle age, while women older than 70 were the most likely to receive palliative care.

Commenting on these findings, Gagnon said: ""The prevention of suffering is an integrated part of cancer control. Health care policies for end-of-life care should seriously promote health services for the terminally ill in view of preventing undue suffering.""

Carbohydrates are the hot topic in dieting circles ? the Atkins diet has consigned them to the back of the kitchen cupboard because of their purported role in weight gain. A new report in Cancer Epidemiology Biomarkers & Prevention (1 August 2004) now links high carbohydrate intake with breast cancer. ""This study raises important questions about high carbohydrate diets"", said study co-author Walter Willet (Scientific American, 9 August 2004). In fact, this case?control study of the dietary habits of 1,866 Mexican women found that those who acquired more than 62 percent of their calories from carbohydrates were 2.2 times more likely to develop breast cancer.

However, scientists have been quick to warn against premature conclusions: ""You cannot make generalizations about 'carbohydrates', because the category contains an enormous variety of foods that have vastly different nutritional profiles and vastly different effects on the body"", stated Ritva Butrum on the American Institute for Cancer Research web site (6 August 2004).

As the authors themselves remark, ""the main carbohydrates these women ate were corn-derived, including tortillas, and soft drinks and bread"" (CNN.com, 6 August 2004). These highly processed, 'refined' carbohydrates lack the insoluble fibre, vitamin and folate content of 'unrefined' carbohydrate sources such as vegetables and fruits. This distinction is an important one, as the study results also indicate that consumption of insoluble fibre is associated with a reduced risk of breast cancer. So, rather than instigating a blanket policy against all carbohydrates, perhaps we should simply be choosing our carbohydrate sources more carefully.

							WASHINGTON - Doctors may be overdoing it a bit on colonoscopies, a procedure to screen for colon cancer using a tiny camera, even though they can save lives, researchers reported Monday

advertisement
Patients who had a low-risk polyp removed in a first colonoscopy do not need to have repeat colonoscopies as often as many doctors are prescribing them, the researchers report in this week's issue of the Annals of Internal Medicine.

""We believe colonoscopy can be a life-saving procedure, but it shouldn't be done more often than necessary,"" said Dr. Pauline Mysliwiec, an assistant professor of gastroenterology at the University of California Davis.

""When it's used inappropriately, it strains health care resources and puts patients at unnecessary risk.""

Colonoscopies involve threading a tiny camera through the rectum into the colon and are the most accurate way to screen for colon cancer. People over 50 are advised to undergo the procedure every 10 years.

The American Cancer Society estimates that 147,000 Americans will be diagnosed with colorectal cancer this year and 57,000 will die from the disease.

Mysliwiec and colleagues at the National Cancer Institute surveyed gastroenterologists and general surgeons about their colonoscopy recommendations in 1999 and 2000.

Medical guidelines on how often patients should have a follow-up colonoscopy do not call for surveillance after removal of a hyperplastic polyp, a benign growth not believed to become cancerous.

People with such growths should only have the recommended colonoscopy every 10 years after age 50.

Yet they found that 24 percent of the gastroenterologists and 54 percent of the general surgeons surveyed recommended surveillance colonoscopy every three to five years for a small, hyperplastic polyp.

""Overuse of colonoscopy taxes the health care system and may compromise the quality of care,"" the researchers wrote.

""Long waiting times of several months are already occurring in some parts of the country and could mean reduced access for symptomatic patients and those with limited means.""

A colonoscopy costs between $1,500 to $1,700 in the United States.

New recommendations on chemotherapy
In a second report, the American Society of Clinical Oncology issued new recommendations saying patients who have been successfully operated on for stage II colon cancer do not need any chemotherapy.

Writing in the Journal of Clinical Oncology, they said patients who get chemotherapy after surgery have only about a 4 percent to 5 percent greater chance of survival five years after surgery, compared with patients who had surgery alone.

""It is critical for each patient to weigh the risk of therapy and any potential benefit,"" said Dr. Al Benson, director of the Robert H. Lurie Comprehensive Cancer Center's Clinical Investigations Program at Northwestern University.

CHICAGO - Men with prostate cancer that doesn?t appear to have spread have better survival chances when they get short-term hormone treatment along with standard radiation, rather than radiation alone, a small study found.

advertisement
click here
Almost five years after treatment, six men in the radiation-only study group died of prostate cancer; none of the men who got combined treatment died of prostate cancer. The study involved about 200 men.

Of the more than 200,000 U.S. men diagnosed each year with the disease, nearly half have the kind cancer involved in the study: An exam and imaging indicates it hasn?t spread but other tests indicate it might have.

Likely to become prevalent
Treatment for such men often involves radiation alone or radiation combined with long-term use of hormone-fighting drugs, often for as long as three years or more. But long-term drug use may cause thinning bones, heart abnormalities that can lead to sudden death and impaired mental function.

?It?s a very important and useful study and should have nearly immediate impact on the fashion in which men are treated.?

? Dr. Durado Brooks
American Cancer Society
The study found that using hormone-blocking drugs for six months had the same survival benefits as long-term use but without the potential health risks. Some men did have side effects including impotence, but that can occur with other prostate cancer treatments, including surgery and radiation.

?It?s a very important and useful study and should have nearly immediate impact on the fashion in which men are treated,? said Dr. Durado Brooks, director of prostate cancer programs at the American Cancer Society.

?Significant numbers of men are getting radiation only,? Brooks said. That?s partly because many men reject hormone-suppressing drugs when they learn about all the bad side effects from long-term treatment, he said.

Brooks said radiation plus short-term medication is likely to become prevalent given the study results.

Researchers studied 206 men aged 49 to 82 randomly assigned to receive about seven weeks of daily radiation treatments, or radiation plus six months of medication overlapping the radiation treatment. Six of those only on radiation died from prostate cancer while none of those getting combined treatment died from prostate cancer.

More than twice as many radiation-only men had evidence of cancer recurrence, 46 versus 21 in the combined treatment group.

The study by researchers at Boston?s Brigham and Women?s Hospital and Dana Farber Cancer Institute appears in Wednesday?s Journal of the American Medical Association.

The patients had prostate cancer that physical exams and imaging tests indicated had not spread. But they also had high blood levels of PSA ? prostate specific antigen ? and high Gleason scores, which measure the degree of abnormality found in cancer tissue.

The high levels raise the possibility of cancer elsewhere, said lead author Dr. Anthony D?Amico, a radiation oncologist at both institutions.

The drug treatment studied involved flutamide pills three times daily with periodic injections of either leuprolide acetate or goserelin. The drugs suppress production of testosterone, which can fuel prostate cancer growth.

Men in the drug-radiation group had more severe impotence and more breast tissue enlargement than the radiation only group. But they had no obvious evidence of the potentially more debilitating complications of long-term treatment. Although those weren?t specifically measured, they usually don?t appear until after at least a year of treatment, D?Amico said.

In a JAMA editorial, Dr. Thomas DeWeese of Johns Hopkins University, said the study did not address how the drug treatment affected patients? quality of life. He also said the radiation dose was lower than is frequently given, which might explain the differing survival rates.

Still, he called the study ?extremely important? because of the survival advantage shown.

							Yes, I agree. My Mom is dying of cancer- she is down to her last few days, but we still find reasons to laugh. My Mom's one request has been for us to give her marajuana to help with her pain.  I can't help but laugh a little to watch my parents smoke a joint together- something I never thought I would see.

							Dear Guest,

You sound as if you are in lots of pain and I'm very sorry about that.  

I don't think anyone is saying that you should not take cancer seriously.  I, too. lost loved ones.  I lost my dad to lung cancer and my mom had breast cancer.  I just finished treatments for invasive breast cancer.

However, humor and a positive attitude got me through the stress.  Yes, my husband and I have made jokes about my cancer.  It's the only way I could get through the treatments.  I remember my dad used to make jokes, too.  It worked for him.  Sometimes we just have to do what works for us.  No, a positive attitude won't cure someone, but it will make it easier to get through each day.  And each day will have a better quality of life.

I don't think anyone would trivialize cancer.  Laughter is just one coping mechanism that works for us.

							Yes, cancer does need to be taken seriously. I think the trick is to not let cancer take over your life. It is a horrible, horrible thing, but try to also see the good things in life.  Our loved ones who are suffering or who we have lost would want us to still find reasons to laugh and smile. The pain will always be there. We will always miss them. But, as much as we may not want it to, life goes on.  I lost my Mom two weeks ago. My brother's wedding was a week later. As hard as it was, we all still celebrated his marriage as my Mom would have wanted.  During her final days, we smiled and laughed as much as we cried. We didn't laugh at the cancer or her sickness, but at the irony of life and as a way of letting go of some of the stress that was building up in us.

							Hi,

I'm so sorry about  your dad.  My dad also had lung cancer which had metastasized to the brain and other organs.  He was in the ICU for a few weeks before he died.  

The only thing I can suggest is to talk to others about your feelings.  Maybe a minister or priest?  While I was undergoing my cancer treatments my hospital had a cancer support group that met twice a month in the evenings.  It wasn't exclusively for the patients.....family members of the patient were also welcomed.  It was moderated by the hospital social worker.  Everyone was welcome.  I would suggest that you call your local hospital and ask if they provide this service.  I believe that most  hospitals do.  It really does help to talk to others in a similar experience.

If you can't do that maybe an online support group, such as this one?  The lung cancer section hasn't really taken off yet, but there is a Living with Cancer one at ivillage.  Lots of people are posting there.

Hope this helps.  Prayers to you and your dad.

What he said. Screen more often, but don't let it worry you excessively. In a sense, knowing you are higher risk is a blessing in disguise, since you are more likely to catch anything early, while it is much more curable. Those of us with no family history or risk factors often don't find out until the tumor is big, nasty, and spreading.

							My surgeon, Professor Parvaiz when asked by my son if he was at increased risk since I was diagnosed with colon cancer said. 
Slight but unquantifiable higher risk, but if son hadn't got it by the age of 40 (which he hasnt) then 2 yearly colonoscopies from the age of 50 should be sufficient. If after 3 consecutive clear colonoscopies then don't worry.

Are you in LA or one of the surrounding areas?  If it's really LA try the UCLA breast center or City of Hope.  If you're in Orange County try Hoag.

If your cancer is ER+, I would suggest you look into a new test through Genomic Health:

CHICAGO/NEW YORK (Reuters) - When it comes to the price tag for the newest biotechology drugs for cancer and other hard-to-treat diseases, the sky is likely to remain the limit, insurers, drugmakers and industry watchers say.

Neither HMOs nor the government-sponsored Medicare program is seriously challenging unprecedented costs for the new drugs, which include rheumatoid arthritis and multiple sclerosis treatments.

While these new drugs now serve only a narrow population, a stream of other pricey biotech medicines will steadily be launched to serve an aging U.S. population. Their toll on insurers and Medicare could then explode.

Among the new breed of drugs are AstraZeneca Plc's $1,700-a-month Iressa pill for lung cancer and Genentech's injectable Avastin for colon cancer at $4,400 a month.

""There's a public perception that if a drug does any good, we're entitled to have it,"" said Ira Loss, an analyst for independent research firm Washington Analysis. ""That means the future costs of providing drugs to the elderly will likely far exceed"" Medicare spending forecasts.

ImClone Systems Inc.'s colon cancer drug, Erbitux, commands about $10,000 per month yet has not been shown to prolong the lives of the desperately ill patients for whom it is approved.

Avastin prolonged the lives of colon cancer victims by about five months in clinical trials, while Erbitux only shrank tumors in clinical trials but still provided some hope as a last ditch treatment.

Older drugs have typically been made of chemicals that are easy and relatively inexpensive to mass produce.

Many biotech drugs, however, are laboratory-altered, naturally occurring proteins that are expensive and complicated to produce and must be injected. Even so, their prices have sparked controversy.

BLACKMAIL?

""Companies are charging whatever they want to extend your life a few months; it's like blackmail,"" said Shaojing Tong, a Mehta Partners analyst who predicted the government may eventually intervene to force down prices.

Tong said insurers are also facing costs of up to $20,000 a year for new injectable treatments for rheumatoid arthritis, including Amgen Inc.'s Enbrel and Johnson & Johnson's Remicade.

One of the most promising cancer drugs in development is Tarceva, an OSI Pharmaceuticals pill found to extend the lives of lung cancer patients by two months in clinical trials, and to lengthen the lives of patients with pancreatic cancer by two weeks.

OSI Chief Executive Colin Goddard said Tarceva's price will likely mirror that of similar therapies on the market, such as Novartis' leukemia treatment Gleevec, which carries a $2,200 monthly price tag.

""We have to measure these drugs' benefit to society against how we spend money on other things,"" Goddard said, addressing the healthcare system's ability to bear such costs.

Medicare, the federal health plan for the elderly and disabled, is covering most of these new drugs. As the biggest buyer of pharmaceuticals, it spends $5 billion a year on drugs, most of them injectable ones.

NO BALKING -- YET

The new treatments haven't broken the bank yet because they are still used by a limited number of patients.

""The question of covering Gleevec and Avastin and Erbitux is certainly going to get people's attention and this is going to be a real Medicare budget issue,"" said Len Lichtenfeld, deputy chief medical officer at the American Cancer Society.

Private insurers do not yet appear to be balking at reimbursement either, mindful that consumers expect access to drugs that provide hope regardless of the cost.

But they are not happy about it.

""When a patient gets a $1,000 (treatment) for a $20 co-payment, that is something that concerns us,"" said Winston Wong, chief pharmacy officer at CareFirst, a Blue Cross Blue Shield plan in Maryland with 3.2 million members.

Many of these treatments are so new it remains unclear what their real benefits may be. And perhaps much more study needs to be done to correctly identify and target just which patients are likely to be helped by them as a way of curtailing soaring costs to the healthcare system.

But for now, says William Fleming, chief pharmacy officer for Humana Inc., in many cases, ""we are going on hope.""

							I am currently undergoing chemtherapy using a Roche product called Xeloda (capecitabine).  One cycle of treatments (28 treatment days) costs just about $2200, which does seem awfully high.  Note, however, that this is orally administered, as opposed to the 5-FU based drugs it replaces, which had to be infused using a daily IV.  

In this case, it turns out that a costly orally-administered drug costs less overall than one which must be infused, even if the infused drug were available for free.  Infusion is a costly process, in both time and hospital resources, and that cost has been eliminated.

Certainly, I would prefer that the Xeloda were inexpensive.  The shocked look on the young pharmacist's face when the bill topped $2000 was amusing to see, as seemingly no one can just pay such prices.  And yet what is the alternative?  I do not have a co-payment based insurance plan, and so I see the full costs at the time of purchase.  I suppose that I could just not be treated, which it would seem that the insurance industry would prefer.  However, since I intend to survive this bout with cancer, after paying the hospital, surgeon, and associated folks $75,000 to cut the tumor out, failing to pay the $6,600 for the final pill bill to make sure it doesn't come back would seem irrational.

							The price has nothing to do with how much it costs to produce the stuff.   They basically sell it for as much as they possibly can.  Pharmaceuticals sell the same drugs in different countries at very, very different prices. 

I've compared prices for brand-name cancer drugs here in Chile with online drugstores (even Canadian ones) and they're much cheaper here.  The Vesanoid I took was made in Switzerland by Roche and was identical to the same stuff sold in the U.S. and Canada for a lot more.

							Washington -- Cancer survivors experience a poorer quality of life than do people who have never been diagnosed with cancer, according to a new study. The finding was true even for those who survived more than 10 years after their diagnosis.

""I was surprised,"" said lead author Robin Yabroff, PhD, an epidemiologist at the National Cancer Institute. ""We have some follow-up studies in the pipeline to try to understand it a little bit better.""

The study was published in the Sept. 1 Journal of the National Cancer Institute.

More and more people will likely be living with cancer in the near future as a result of earlier detection and more effective treatments. One million people in the United States will be diagnosed with cancer this year, and that number is expected to double by 2050 as the population increases and ages.

The researchers studied data collected in the 2000 National Health Interview Survey, an annual survey that asks respondents questions about their lives and health. They analyzed responses from more than 1,800 cancer survivors and nearly 5,500 control subjects matched for age, gender and level of education.

They found that cancer survivors were more likely to describe their health as poor or fair than were those who had never been diagnosed with cancer. Survivors were also more likely to report being unable to work because of their illness or to have lost more days of work due to illness during the previous year. The finding was true for all types of cancer and regardless of how many years had passed since the cancer was diagnosed.

The breadth of the data analyzed meant that some of the depth was sacrificed, said William F. Lawrence, MD, senior fellow in outcomes research at the Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality, who is also an author of the study. ""So we can say that in the population there is a burden of illness in cancer survivors, but we don't know why,"" said Dr. Lawrence. ""I'm sure the reasons will be different for different people.""

A mixed review
Some people may have had a recurrence of their cancer while the poor health of others may be attributable to the residual effects of their cancer treatment, said the researchers. For example, they note that several studies have found that men undergoing surgery for localized prostate cancer may continue to experience incontinence and impotence after their initial treatment.

The main message to physicians who care for cancer patients is to know that this burden of illness persists, said Dr. Lawrence. ""Clinicians need to ask their patients about how cancer impacts on their life overall and explore with the individual patient a way they can be helped.""

1 million Americans will be diagnosed with cancer in 2004.  
But Deborah Armstrong, MD, a medical oncologist at Johns Hopkins' School of Medicine, said it wasn't surprising that people who are diagnosed with cancer have more problems with work and finances than those never diagnosed with cancer.

""It might have been fairer to compare these patients with those who have had a history of heart disease or diabetes."" The researchers may then have tried to determine whether people with a history of cancer are more productive or have a better overall outcome compared with those with heart disease, for example, she said.

While it's always good to have the data, she said, the findings may not be beneficial to cancer patients. ""I worry that people who have a diagnosis of cancer will have more trouble getting insurance or getting a job. I'm not sure it's going to have a positive outcome.""

Bonnie Teschendorf, PhD, director of Quality of Life Science at the American Cancer Society, agreed that the fact that cancer survivors face greater burdens in their lives is not surprising, but she praised the study. ""This is a very important study to begin to characterize what happens to people after they have left their treatment. It shows what happens in their lives after that,"" she said. ""Once people leave medical care, it is more difficult to track them and find out what has happened and how it has impacted their lives.""

The value of this study also comes, in part, from its national data, which are not easy to gather, she said.

Interest in the quality of life of the 9.8 million cancer survivors in the nation has increased over the past two or three years, she noted. The cancer society stepped up its attention to this population about two years ago with a special project.

There is also an effort to develop clinics that provide follow-up care to former cancer patients, and the new findings will provide an idea of who needs services and what those services might be, Dr. Teschendorf said.

							Dr. Leo, 
My mother passed away 4 years ago this month.   She was diagnosed with breast cancer and lung cancer.   The operated and removed one of her breast and a pie section from her lung.     She was told there were three lymth nodes from the breast which had cancer cells.  She went thru the rounds of chemo therapy.    About 18 months later they found out she had a brain tumor.    She under went lazer therapy for the brain tumor(sept 30).  They said she had two months to two years to live.   She died within the two months.    She wanted to die at home.   She got hospice  to come in and check on her.   They did a great job.   She would not allow me to come to take care of her till she got were she really needed me.   I went home on nov 7th and she passed away nov 29.   She was cremated dec 4th.   I was flying from texas to missouri every other weekend before i went there full time.      

They said that the brain tumor traveled from the lung to the brain.    The  doctors office had lost her scan they didn of her body(mnr?)  No one would tell her she had the cancer back in her lungs until she went to the emergency room and the emergency room doctor told her.     My mother was 65 when she passed away.

The hard part about this for me, is a year after her death we find out the pharmist in kansas city, Courtney...diluted her chemo medications.    He is in prison for the rest of his life.     But, how can someone be so greedy to distroy over 300 people's lives for money.    He killed hundreds of people with his greediness.    If it wasn't for him, she might still be here.

This time of the year is hard for me..I just wanted to let you know i respected my mother's wishes, she wanted to die at home.   I am glad for the time we had together.   We got to say things to each other that i will always carry in my heart.  It wasn't easy and i still have nightmares from that time.    I sometimes feel like I didn't do everything I could have done for her.   But i tried my best (I worked as a nurses aid when i graduated from high school - that training came in very handy).

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Infection with simian virus 40 (SV40) plays little or no role in the development of mesothelioma, a cancer affecting the lining of the lungs that has been linked to asbestos exposure, according to a report in The Lancet.

In the 1950s and 1960s, several hundred thousand military recruits in the US received a vaccine contaminated with SV40. Since then, concerns have been raised that SV40 may cause cancer after researchers noticed the presence of its DNA in various tumor specimens.

However, the new results indicate that the SV40 DNA seen in these specimens may have simply resulted from contamination in the lab -- the virus was not actually present in the tumor before it was removed from the patient.

The current findings are just the latest in a series of reports that have failed to show a link between SV40 and various cancers, such as mesothelioma, lymphoma, and brain tumors.

In the study, Dr. Marc Ladanyi and colleagues, from Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center in New York, looked for SV40 DNA in 71 mesothelioma samples.

The authors found no evidence of genuine SV40 DNA in the tumor specimens. They did, however, find SV40 DNA that came from circular molecules called plasmids, not from the virus itself. The researchers suggest that these plasmids were probably introduced as contaminants in the lab.

""Because SV40 appears unlikely to have a major role, if any, in human mesotheliomas, (doctors) should continue to consider asbestos exposure as the most likely and most thoroughly established (cause) in individuals with this cancer,"" the researchers conclude.

							I too was diagnosed recently (7/12/04) with AML Leukemia.  I am 44 years old and have spent the last five months in and out of hospital for chemotherapy and secondary infection.  I have one more high dose maintenance chemotherapy to complete.  

I would be interested to hear from another AML patient who has had a similar situation.  I read that for a bone marrow transplant to have a chance to work (albeit 60% chance), it must be done within the first year of a the AML patient's remission.  Is that right?

I'm also under the impression that is my best chance for any longevity due to the agressive nature of AML.  Is that right?

For long-term survival for AML the best therapy is a bone marrow transplant, There are a lot of risks related to that, and this has to be weighed against other options. Some experts recommend BMT right away if possible, but that depends on characteristics of the disease.

At, first it was really rough, He stayed in the hospital for about 6 mths. when we first found out.He was really sick, we didnt think he was going to make it, but he was strong. He had a bone marrow transplant and he is better. He just started back taking chemo, and he has to take it for four weeks,once a week. We sit there for six hours, and then he is sick and sometimes he is just tired.The side effects are different. I heard that after you only live up to five years with this disease. Is this true? My father looks very good, and has gained about 50 lbs. in the past two years. I was just wondering if you are more likely to die within five years.

							Leo -- you are fantastic.  This site is an EXTREMELY good idea.  I hope it will work wonderfully.  I am here from having heard from you at the Yahoo Breast Cancer Survivor Network website.

Since you are a doctor, I was wondering if you could try to answer this:
I had a left mastectomy on Sept. 2, 2004.  They also removed the sentinel node and a few other nodes from under my arm (all negative--I'm lucky.)  A drainage tube was left in and removed on the 12th day after surgery.  When removed, it was still draining 40 mg. of blood every day.  They thought it was left in long enough and removed it.  Though everything is healing nicely, there is a large, very hard lump under my arm (like a small extra breast).  Should I be in touch with the surgeon's office to maybe have this aspirated?  Or is it normal?  Thank you.

First of all, thanks for your comments. I need everyone's help to disseminate the existence of this forum. I will be having more colleagues join me here to help answer questions.

Anyway, about your question. It is very hard to know exactly your situation. I don't know what type of cancer it is, the stage. But assuming it is early breast cancer, which was completely removed and negative nodes, even if you had a local recurrence it would be extremely early. What happened almost for sure is the development of a seroma, or a small cavity containing serum, or fluid. It may get larger and perforate spontaneously. You should have this seen, and you might need drainage once again. This is not too uncommon, but it definitely needs care. I can not consider this normal, but a small complication of the surgical procedure.

Someone on my support website was asking about getting her complete breast cancer pathology report explained with her actual survival rate.  This is what we all want to know, for example.  Would you have a pathologist in mind who would do this?  (I won't talk it up too much if you ask me not to, so you have a chance to get ready.) 

Hope this didn't discourage you!

As you know,  pathologists have their own terms. Personally I don't think that pathological details play a big role in survival. That's why the clinical stages were invented. To guide treatment and somehow categorize groups of patients in survival groups. That allows us to compare groups of patients with the same disease and different methods of treatment. I'd advise to try to not be to detailed about your labs, tests and reports. Leave that for the physicians who do that on a regular basis. I think that this may just bring more anxiety into context.  It's like when you go to the machanic and ask him to explain exactly how he replaced part X, which parts had to be taken out of the way etc. In the end, what you really want to know is: which part was broken, how was it fixed in general terms, and how much it costs, if it may happen again and so forth.

You see, cancer is such a difficult disease to deal with, in my consultations I'd rather spend more time discussing how the patient and physician can work together to fight the disease, instead of explaining very difficult concepts that may not be of use at all to the patient.

Again, thanks for your support.  You can let all your friends know about this. I'll be here

							Janie - If there's fluid gathering somewhere after removal of your drain, it could be lymph fluid. Just in case your docs haven't mentioned lymphedema, you might want to read up on it. You can go to www.lymphnet.org for more info. 

While oftentimes doctors don't think you're at risk if you only had a few nodes removed... the fact is that any change in the lymph system could put you at risk for lymphedema. While it may be mild lymphedema... it's always good to understand the risks, and what could cause it to flare up.

I always thought that soy was beneficial in reducing re/occurance of breast cancer - here in the UK a book by Jane Plant entitled ""Your life in your hands"" suggests just that, citing the low incidence of bc in countries like China and Japan.For quite a while, I followed her diet, which advocates cutting out dairy and substituting it with soy.
However, the reports are coming in very strongly, that because soy is full of phytoestrogens, then it could act like a trigger to bc, and is therefore best avoided. What are your views on this subject, specifically in the light of the research you quote, and particularly with regard to people like myself, whose tumor was estrogen receptor positive?

Anyway, environmental causes of disease are a big problem. Why ? Because massive studies with a very large group of people is necessary to prove something. Just take a look at other theories out there, such as cellular phones and cancer. There are so many confounding variables that it is a mess to try to figure it out.

Now to your question. We know that these phytoestrogens do have some effect, and despite lacking evidence that these substances can be harmful, I would avoid anything that could activate the estrogen receptors. Again, this is not shown in serious research, but it's just common sense.

A FORUM TO HELP US AND THOSE WE LOVE LIVE WITH CANCER IN A POSITIVE WAY FOREVER  

Please contact Audrey Darrow at wdbinternational@yahoo.com if you are interested in attending a forum for men and women living with cancer. I am surviving breast cancer after having gone through the battle in 2003 and have yet to find a place to have my voice heard, to hear from oncologists regarding treatments, to teach people in the medical community what breast cancer really does to our lives, to have our families finally understand what we are going through and to be able to be in a 100% positive atmosphere where I can laugh, learn, help others and feel close to others in the cancer community. Support groups are good for many people, however, I am someone who likes to speak out to people to motivate them, help them understand that there is hope, that cancer is truly a gift from God to teach us and to help people speak out to others to have their voices heard.

Many women suffer in silence and do not get the support that is needed to live through this difficult illness and I would like to start a speaking forum that will start out monthly. This will be a place where people in the cancer community can come for discussions, information, learn the resources available and just a place to come and relax, feel good, make a new friend, share our difficulties and triumphs with others and learn to take life one day at a time and enjoy every breath we take.

If you have interest in attending one of these forums please send me your name, telephone and email address and as soon as I have enough interest I will set a time and a place in San Diego for us all to attend. The fee will be nominal so that everyone can afford to come.  I will ask for a $5.00 contribution to cover rental of a place to meet and refreshments.  If any of you have any ideas to include in this forum please send them to me. As I wait to hear of your interest I will begin my search for people of influence to speak at the forum. If you know of any oncologists, surgeons, plastic surgeons, politicians, movie stars,  corporations that might sponser us, gynecologists, rheumatologists or any other people of influence that can give us important information regarding our health, make us laugh, listen to our stories, share their own stories of cancer and captivate our interest in any way then please send me the names and I will contact them all to join us in the future. I hope that all of you who read this feel like I do and wish to have your voice heard.

							Hi Folks.
I fear as if I have a very unusual situation I've fallen into. I'm an American, but I live in Japan-- and not Tokyo... a provincial city on the Japan Sea Coast called Toyama. We are quite far from much unconventional English-language resource, which makes me feel even more isolated in this.  
My girlfriend of two years is facing lung cancer diagnosis of some sort. As a 27-year-old non-smoker, I gotta wonder what are the odds... But that point aside, I am so afraid of this situation and my ability to 'be there' for her. 
As it is, things seem to be going too slowly... there was an X-Ray three weeks ago. A follow-up X-Ray today. Blood tests and CT scans are scheduled two days from now. That seems to take so long!
My biggest problem is that my Japanese stinks. I'm learning, but y'know, vocabulary for things like 'lung' and 'metastacize' just hasn't come up. What's more, as an unmarried foreigner, the idea of my joining her in helping to make decisions is considered utterly ridiculous to everybody involved. 
My girlfriend presents how the docs say 'Could be cancer' and nobody can tell me when they might know if it is or not. 
After this... I dunno. If there is a diagnosis made, I'm betting the first thing that will happen is that she's gonna get packed off to her parents house at the other end of the country. Um... her mother isn't too crazy about having a foreigner in the family, so I'm not expecting an invitation to come visit. It doesn't mean I won't go, but I fear that my creating stress within her family by forcing my presence where it might not be wanted wouldn't be really all that helpful either. 
So, I think I see a lot of threats to my relationship coming with this diagnosis (IF it happens. I must be positive now).  So much of the standard writing I'm finding on the internet about how to be a caregiver assumes that A) all parties involved speak English fluently and B) that you're living in a society where your good intentions are all that's needed to ensure a role as a caregiver.  How do you be encouraging or try to ""face reality"" when nobody is in a position to give you solid facts about the situation?
Sigh. I'm sorry. All of this is contingent on so many big IFs right now. All I know right now is that things are going to change rather radically in my relationship in about 48 hours and I'm just thinking... Be prepared...  Any advice?

							I was diagnoised with Breast Cancer Sept. 8. 2004. So far I've seen surgeons, radilogist and onocologists. I have NOT had any treatments yet. I wanted to wait until after my son's wedding on Oct.2. My surgeon assured me that I was NOT risking my health or my life by waiting the 3 weeks. 
I've been given so much information that I no longer know which way to jump. I have a lump that is 2.5 cm in length and another that was NOT biopsied that is about .5cm. 
The surgeon tells me I can have a lumpectomy (I'm pretty big busted) and radiation or they can do a mastectomy and chemo. The radiologist agrees with a lumpectomy. However my onocolgist does not like the ""looks"" of the other lump, he says in his opinion it looks suspicious and that by the hardness of the big lump and the proximity of the other lump that a lumpectomy is not a good option, he indicates that the big lump is in his opinion, ""egg shaped"" and deep in the breast but because there is no 3D image to tell that for sure he will abide my my decision, but to be aware that if the lump is egg shaped They would remove the breast anyway. The onocolgist is telling me that it might be very tramatic emotionally to expect a lumpectomy and wake up to discover they had to remove the breast but he will support which ever decision I make. Reconstruction IS available to me.
But taking the chemo and losing my hair scares me more than losing the breast and NO ONE understands my crazy reasoning regarding that. I also have some issues with my heart that have to be considered (I have a stent) 
I would just like some input as to how others have dealt with it. I'm not scared, I'm just irritated that I can't make a decision! Which method is safest and mostly like to make sure they get ALL the cancer?

							Hi

That's the difficult part. You've been given all the information, now you'll have to decide... I can't advise you on either direction. You can certainly talk some more to your physicians about this, and explain what you're feeling. I am sure they will be receptive. 

You can also get other medical opinions, if you are not confident in your current doctors, but I think that's not the case. It's good that you have time to think, though.

							I too have felt your frustration.  I think it comes down to this...Surgeons cut, radiologists radiate, oncologists medicate.  They seem to rarely give the same infatic option.  In the end, it is truly your decision.  I also understand about rather losing a breast than having chemo.  In my situation, I did not have to have chemo.  But before that conclusion was reached, I felt the same way you did.  

I think it comes down to this....how much of a risk taker are you.  There are many women who want NO risk and choose to do everything to prevent a reoccurance.  There are some women who are willing to take a small risk and follow up rigorously with their doctors for after care.  There are some women who choose to take the biggest risk and have no after care and just follow up with screenings.

What ever happened to the days when your family doctor said ""This is what we have, and this is what we're going to do about it!""  I know that having options to make your own decision is, in reality, better, but this can be so overwhelming that you just wish someone else would make the decision for you.

I was diagnosed in November, 2003.  They found it by accident.  I know that I am lucky they did.  I had a second surgery in Jan. 2004 to ""clear the margins"".  It was deep, close to the chest wall, so they decided to radiate.  I had 6 weeks of radiation starting in March ending in May.  I got married in June.  I decided not to wait to radiate and it wasn't too bad.  I was lucky not to have many side effects.

I don't know if any of this will help you.  The decision is yours.  Be strong, ask a million questions, don't give up until they are answered and take good care of yourself.

							I absolutely understand having a problem with losing your hair more then your breast, I was the same way.  I opted to have a mastectomy and then a year later have the other one removed to give myself the best possible chance of avoiding a reoccurence.  I tried reconstruction and it was a diseaster.  I had the mastectomies, chemo and radiation, which I know you won't have to have all of that, but the hair does grow back and I've never regretted my decision to have both removed.  I had just turned 43 when dx a little over 2 1/2 years ago and I had a 5.5 cm tumor and 9+/16 nodes.  It's your decision of course, but I opted for the 1st mastectomy because I knew that was the only way they would remove any stray cancer cells floating around.  My tumor was egg shaped as yours is.  The mammogram missed that large of a tumor, but I kept pushing the issuen because I knew something wasn't right and thank God I did.

							I can definately relate to your situation. I too was diagnosed (199 and told that lumpectomy would be my best option.. however when I had my lumpectomy they could not get clean margins (a medically accepted space that was cancer free)  because of the shape of my lesion and size (5.2cm.), which they did not expect.  When the time came for the mastectomy they also found that I had lymph node involvement.. this was not a senitinel node biopsy, which is mostly done today.  As it turned out I was diagnosed at a stage III.  Thus had to have chemo, radiation, and more chemo.  I have now also taken arimdex for 5 years.  As far as the hair goes.. my hair was down to my waist and loosing that was definately upsetting, however in the scheme of things it was not as traumatic as I thought it was going to be.  Because of my chemo being seperated with my radiation I was bald for a year.  However, I do know how you feel about your hair and no it is not crazy to feel that the loss of your hair would be more traumatic then your breast, I actually always had more compliments about my hair then my breast    However, I am here to tell you that though this is not an easy journey by any means, it is a doable one and that one of the biggest lessons that I have learned from this part of my life experiences is that we are amazing in our ability to survive and thrive in all areas of our lives.  This will take you down to the lowest point in your life at times but it also empowers you in a way that you never thought possible.  I wish the best for you, and know that you will make the right decision for you.  Let us know how you make out.

							Hi Reba - you might ask your Oncologist about the Packman Cold Cap treatment when you are having chemo. The Head Nurse in the Oncology Dept at the hospital (in the UK) told me about it. It can't be used with every chemo cocktail, but was available for mine, which was FEC. Even then, she said there was no guarantee it would work, but I thought I had come that far I may as well try. It worked fine!! My hair went thin, but I certainly did not go bald. It is like a heavy motor cycle helmet which is connected by a line to a freezing unit by your chemo chair. I had to wear the cap for half hour before infusion, during, and one hour afterwards. I just used to fall asleep, wrapped up nicely in a duvet. I don't know if it is used in the USA but it won't hurt to ask about it. When the chemo was finished, my hair grew so thick and curly, and a year later, still is.

							Explaination     I originally lost my hair with my A/C (andriamycin/Cytoxin), then I had radiation for 38 treatments, not long enough for my hair to grow back, then I had Taxol, and out it came again the little that did grow back... by the end of the taxol my hair started to grow back slightly... but not to the point that I went topless till january, new years eve... I lost it in february.. so it was a year (almost)  another interesting thing is that I did not loose my eyebrows and eyelashes until the taxol.  I hated my wigs, only wore them 3-4 times wore great colorful scarfs.  I have a lot of great stories about my hair loss that really took the edge off of the whole experience for me and for those around me.  You have to have a great sense of humor about the negatives otherwise they eat you up... As hard as it is in most situations I always look for the humor in what our lifes journey gives us... laughter is the best medicine!

     I hate my wig and do not wear it. I'm doing the scarf thing also. I did 4 treatments of a/c and then 4 taxol.

Trying to get him to help me pick some out. There are some really cool ones out there. Your right about the laughter it is one of the things that helps us to make it through.

							Hi-My father in law was diagnosed with colon cancer in June. He had surgery to remove the tumor but more was found in lymph nodes and 2 small spots on liver. He recently developed blood clots and was hospitalized to treat that. During this time he had another CAT scan showing there are now 7 lesions on liver. His Dr has said that if this Chemo (Erbitux) doesn't work, then that's it, no other treatments available. Isn't it too soon to make that call? What would you recommend.

From the information you gave me, your father has metastatic colon cancer. Different specialists will give you different options. They will have diverging opinions. It is very difficult to know the best path, but medical Oncology is a difficult specialty, with a very fine line between offering or not different strategies. A lot of it is how confident a given doctor is in its treatment, and what past experiences this person may have had with it. My opinion is to have doctors explain why they are not offering other options. In their opinion, they might think that giving treatment X may create so many side-effects and potential disasters that they'd rather not do more harm.

							I am 71 with stage 4 rectal cancer. I was dx exed about 2years ago. I have had  chemo ( CI 5FU) with radiation and a few months more of chemo. The scans after showed mets on my liver and lungs. I was referred to a teaching hospital, Mass General, for a liver resection. At this time we are deciding what to do about the lung mets. I expect we will try CI 5fu for a cycle and and and then review the results. The Onc that I have reviews many of his cases with an Onc at Mass.

Are you still around? How did it go with your students? 

I teach fourth grade. Since I am undergoing chemo and have missed quite a bit of time and my hair will fall out, I told my students. We were studying a unit on medicine in Language Arts at the time. I read them excerpts from a children's book on cancer so they would understand what it was. 

I explained the doctors found some cancer cells in my body and that they were going to give me medicine or chemotherapy to make me better. I explained that I might miss some time from work in order to see the doctor but that was because I was working very hard at getting better.

 One student did ask if I was going to die. I answered honestly that I didn't believe so but that we all do die at some point in our lives, and no one can no for sure what will happen tomorrow. They seemed to accept this and I didn't have to lie to them. I lost a parent at a young age and I wish people had been more honest with me.

							I had a mastectomy for extensive DCIS w/ ~15 nodes removed and a free TRAM reconstruction and a hernia repair on Aug 10th.  It was 15 hours of surgery and I spent 2 nights in ICU and 3 more in the hospital after that.  I was originally planning to be back at work by now but becuase there was 1 positive node and 1.5 cm of invasive cancer found they started me on a dense dose AC/Taxol Chemo schedule about 3 weeks ago.   I have 2 kids under the age of 5 years and now feel like it would be too stressful with my treatment schedule and side effects to try and return to work during my treatment.   But the cost of childcare just for me to go to all my appts even is a strain right now.

I was told that my disability was approved but am still waiting to see the first check after 6+ weeks.  I am wondering how long the disabilty will even pay? and what will happen with my job if I exceed the 12 weeks FMLA time and stay out until my chemo is finished around xmas?  And how likely is it that I will even feel up to going back to work right away in Jan after this treatment course is completed?

							Hello,
My name is Lucy and I have recently become the caregiver to my mother whom has been diagnosed with stage Iv METASTATIC LUNG CANCER.  
A brain tumor was found in her in late August.  The primary source of her cancer has not been found.  The tumor cells resemble Lung cancer cells but after having an MRI, bone scan, CAT scan and PET scan, no other tumors have been found.
Does anyone know if this is typical for the lungs to not be showing tumors?  Could the tumors be blocked by scar tissue that is in her lungs due to lung cancer surgery from 10 years ago?  It is my understanding that in order for her to have lung cancer cells in her brain, there has to be tumors in her lungs also.  Does anyone know if this is true?
Although I am very happy with her dr.s, I am frustrated with the lack of a prognosis for her.  AT the first visit to the radiation oncologist, we were told she has approx. 4-6 months.  Now I cannot get her dr.s to say anything at all about a prognosis.  They now tell me that everyone is different, etc.  I really feel the need to have a good idea of what we are up against and certainly do understand that Dr.s cannot give me a time frame that is set in stone. I cannot access hospice untill I know a prognosis either and the help they could give would be wonderful right now.   I just do not understand if her prognosis has changed due to the lack of tumors being found in the lungs.  
She is on Chemo and radiation that is called palliative care, meaning no cure but comfort.
I thank you all so much for any answers to this post.  Sorry it is so long!
Thanks again, Lucy

							Lucy

I am really sorry to hear about your mother. I posted at a different thread about cancer of unknown origin. The prognosis is really poor, as you know. Unfortunately there is no good chemotherapy regimen that has been shown to be of benefit in this situation.

This is an atypical situation, but not very uncommon. The cells may resemble lung cancer cells, but if a lung cancer can not be found you can not truly call it lung cancer with metastasis. Still, the pathology may show for example squamous cell carcinoma our adenocarcinoma, and there are certainly other sites from which those cells may be coming from. If the doctors have exhausted their search for a primary tumor, and they are calling it a cancer of unknown primary, the prognosis is really poor. But predicting prognosis is really impossible, and I would not even give you numbers, as my guess would not be better than others. It sounds that palliative care is her only treatment option. The only thing that I can be sure is that comfort and pain relief can be achieved, and everyone deserves it. 

yours sincerely

							Lucy - my twin brother had a brain tumour at 50 yrs old some 9 years ago, which was diagnosed after scans and a biopsy, as secondary lung cancer. His doctors never found the primary in his lungs, and I even checked this with his doctor after he died. He lived 11 months from dx - died peacefully at home, not in pain as he was given morphine. I too, cannot understand why they were adamant it was secondary lung cancer, but he was being treated by one of our best teaching hospitals in London, England. He had 2 courses of chemo, no rads as far as I can remember.  He was a Technical Manager for a cellular phone company and lived with a cellphone glued to his ear - we, his family, blame the radiation from the cellphone and don't use them. His tumour was not operable as it was wrapped all around his brain, which I think is most unusual, but I know nothing of brain tumours and my brother really refused to discuss the ins and outs - I don't even know the name of the tumour. He was very positive and just believed he would crack it. RIP.
I hope you get the answers you are looking for, for your mother.

							I knew from what I read it was not good for my father.  But reading this also brings it home.  About 4 months ago he was diagnosed brain tumors that were stage Iv Metastatic non-small cell carcinoma.  They have been unable to find the cancer in his lungs.  My dad is 72 years old and they are only treating it with radiation.  It helped with the brain tumors (he had over 40 with 5 being larger).  Then it moved to the spine in his neck about 2 months ago. They caught it in time and did radiation so he is only partially parallized.  Now it has moved in the bone in the spine.  I have been trying to find info on this but can't find anything specific.  I have heard it is very painful.  But have no information as to if this is true or not.  

I wish you luck with your mother and I hope that my father will make it another 3 to 4 months.  Longer would be nicer but from what I have read... 3 to 4 months is more realistic.  

I am also 700 miles away from my parents and get tired of playing phone tag with the onacologist.  He answers me  but it may take a week.  And if anyone has any information on what happens once it moves into the bone, please let me know.

							Hello

Bone metastasis can be indeed very painfull. One thing that I mentioned is that one thing we *can* do is treat pain very well. It can be difficult, but we have so many different ways to give medication and relieve pain. Other things that can happen are fractures of whichever bones become affected. These fractures can be caused by minimal movement, so one has to have a lot of care about this.

							I appreciate the information.  I didn't realize it also made the bones weak.  I'll talk to the Onocologist and see if anything can be done to help my Dad with this.  Since it is in his spine down below the shoulder blades, there may not be much that can be done to protect it.

							My father was told that he had Non Small Cell Lung Cancer that moved to the left side of his body.
They still have not found any cancer in his lungs but the bones are very weak now because of the cancer.

Broken hip by sitting in chair, then while recovering from that, broken shoulder.

HUGE pain while everything was broken, HUGE relief from pain after the operations to fix them.  
He looks better now than he did before we found out he had cancer.

They told us 6 to 12 months to live, and that was 8 months ago.
I will tell you that some Oncologists can be very cold, they deal with death all the time and try to distance themselves.
Others have a better bed side mannor.
Never hurts to get a second opinion.

							My 65 yr old Mom was just diagnosed with stage iv oat cell carcinoma that has spread to many areas - obviously a heavy smoker.  The two areas of immediate concern are her brain, which has approx. 12 - 17 tumors and one 2cm in the mid brain.  The day that Mom received her brain stem MRI results, she began radiation on the full brain.  She finished her 15 treatments and we are awaiting the blood results to determine the kind of chemo treatment possible.  The other area of concern is that it has spread to her pancreas, as well as one adrenal gland and her kidney.

My question is concerning the steroid that she is taking in heavy doses (24 mg daily for going on one month) and she has symtoms of overdose.  According to what I have read on the web, she has a sign of decadron overdose in that her lower abdomen is very swollen.  Being that the cancer is also in her pancreas, could this be the reason for the swelling?  I am having difficulty getting any real answers from her as she keeps to herself and claims to have no pain besides this newly swollen area.  I am the one to be her caregiver and this is all very new to me. Also, being that the prognosis is poor, is chemo really worth the pain for the temp relief?? Please advise.

Re the article on ""history of smoking significantly reduces survival rates in patients with cancer of the neck and head"" ...

I understand that this is further proof not to take up smoking, or to quit right now, but - if I am right in thinking this - if this forum is for cancer patients and their families, is this the right place for such further ""bad"" news?

If I had cancer of the neck or head, and was or had been a smoker, would I want to read that article in this environment? Just a thought ...

							Two types of thyroid cancer that are closely related and sometimes difficult to distinguish can be readily identified by differences in only a few genes, new research shows.  The study used microarray analysis to show that papillary thyroid carcinoma (PTC) and follicular thyroid carcinoma (FTC) differ in the expression of only four or five genes.  Distinguishing between the two cancers is important because the malignancies behave differently and require different treatment.

In studying these cells' role in tumor development, researchers determined that a protein called MCP-1 ""recruits"" macrophages to the vascular tumor site.

							I have seen the statistics at http://seer.cancer.gov/csr/1975_2001/sections.html about how the occurrences of cancer increased from 1975 to 2001. These were cases from the US. How does this correlate to the number of cases in other parts of the world, especially the third world and Asia.

What I want to know is whether there is information to support or debunk the claim that cancer is an 'epidemic of the western world'?

Is there evidence that i.e. 'western' eating habits, or environmental pollution are real causes for cancer? More so that in other parts of the world?

It is true that we are seeing more cancer in the western world. What also happens is that we are making more diagnoses of previously unrecognized cancers, meaning our tests are just so much better at detecting it.

On the other hand, in general the incidence of cancers differs dramatically if you separate this disease into types of cancer. For example, stomach cancer is much more common in Japan than it is in the US. Certain types of nasopharyngeal cancer are more common in South Asia. Cervical cancer is much more common in underdeveloped countries, since they do not have good Pap-smear screening programs.

You can look at data following this link http://www-depdb.iarc.fr/globocan2002.htm

But I would not say that cancer is worse in the western world at this point.

							I'm a 35 yr old female.  What are the chances that my pituitary tumor is cancerous? How would a doctor tell from the MRI when it was first discovered.  As of last October it was 6mm - how large is too large for these types of tumors and when should they be removed.  I am hypopituitary and my dr said even if he removes it at this time most likely my hormone levels won't go back to normal.  I'm deficient in growth hormone, aldosterone, estradiol, hypothyroid.  Thanks.
						

"

							Hi

The most likely tumor of the pituitary is an adenoma, a tumor that is not malignant, but because it compresses the pituitary it causes several problems as you described with all your hormonal deficits. The problem is that when surgery is performed they usually remove the whole pituitary gland, so whatever was there is going to be gone, and the hormones will have to be replaced for life.

Your tumor is small, but even at this size it is already causing hormonal problems. Discuss with your doctor about the benefits and risks of taking it out. It's hard for me to council you without having a real evaluation.

For Stage IIIA disease the 5-year survival is quoted at 56% (American Cancer Society) but as you know there are so many factors that can increase or reduce your life expectancy. It is more used to predict how to select treatments, for risk-benefit analysis... there is no way to tell if you are going to be on one group versus the other, that's why it's difficult to apply it to individual patients.

She was told her cancer was very aggressive and that she had likely had it for a few years. At that visit the surgeon decided to do a mammogram and then the next day they called and told her to go for an MRI.  This was followed up the next day with a chest x-ray and blood work.

Hi Leo;

After my wife had her mammogram, she was sent for X-rays and blood tests. As she has sciatica, they even X-rayed there.

Since then, she has been diagnosed as pT2, N3a and she is being scheduled to see an oncologist. Initially, it seemed the cancer was T1 and the surgeon was talking about radiation only. It was lobular and that fooled everyone as to the size.

We haven't heard anything about what was seen on the X-rays and blood tests, and didn't remember to ask at our appointments.

Would it be likely that they gave no indication that the cancer had spread??

Thanks, Rich

A chest x-ray may be able to see metastatic disease, but its sensitivity is far from perfect. For staging, what we do is a chest CT. The CXR and the blood tests are mostly in preparation for treatment, looking for lung disease such as emphysema, fibrosis. Blood tests looking for anemia, renal failure, liver dysfunction and such. We need all that data to tailor a specific regimen that fits each individual patient.

Data from the NAtional Cancer Institute rate metastatic disease survival at 5y is 34%, but this is impossible to extrapolate this data to an individual patient. There is no one that can predict how much time your relative has. Prostate cancer is a slow-growing cancer, but the disease may grow at a faster rate at any time, so that makes it even more difficult. 

You should start making arrangements now, since you know that your relative has disseminated disease. As time goes by and things progress, it will be even more difficult to make these arrangements.

							Leo,  first let me say this is great!  I wish you and all those who post here the best, as that there can never be to much support and education on these types of board/forums for those of us dealing with cancer... now.. I was originally diagnosed in 1998, stage IIIA.  I did A/C rads, taxol before I even started chemo I started tomoxifen.  I did tomoxifen for 6 months and had a serious skin reaction to it (I also have crohns disease, which makes me prone to skin reactions)  I was then switched to arimidex which I have been on for 5 years.  My oncologist and I discussed at my last appointment that he feels that the 5 years on the arimidex should suffice, much like the studies with the tomoxifen.  I feel that the arimidex is at this point my life perserver.  Our compromise is that I will continue to take the arimidex till my 6 month check up in march.  I know that he will look further into his studies about arimidex, I know that he does consult with other docs at UPMC about my treatment as that the tomoxifen, and crohns issues he has told me which docs he consulted with... however... I have not found any studies about the 5 years and the arimidex issue, have you any updated information that can be helpful in helping me make the decision to discontinue the arimidex or continue it. 
  Thank you for any input.

Thanks for your kind comments. As you mentioned, it seems your doctor is on top of it. UPMC is really a great institution.

Anyway, most studies don't go beyond 5 years, as it is extremely expensive to fund it. So there will probably be little data in the future beyond 5 years. As these studies end, there will of course be open-label studies of people that choose to continue the treatment, and this will be analyzed but the data won't be nearly as good as the well designed studies. As of now, there is really no data showing that people should be on Arimidex for longer than 5 years.

							Hi Barbara - can't believe I have actually found someone with crohn's and bc! I have had crohn's since I was 26 yrs old, now 60, and I truly feel it has been more difficult to live with than breast cancer. Did your crohn's flare during chemo, and if so, how did the Oncologist and Gastro deal with it? Neither the Onc nor gastro had dealt with a patient who had both diseases concurrently, so they were no help. Eventually I got a young female Onc who prescribed dexamethasone daily throughout my chemo and it helped a little. 
I had a terrible time as my first Onc made me stop taking methotrexate;  he actually said I would die from septicaemia if I continued to take it when having FEC chemo. I did get a bad flare - spent 3 months sipping a nutritional fruit juice prescribed by the hospital and was completely faceally incontinent - twice in the street which was so embarrassing.

I am now taking an experimental steroid: prednisolone sodium metasulphabenzoate, which is only metabolised in the colon, and except for early mornings, am doing fine.  I don't think it is available widely as I have to get it from the hospital pharmacy - it was developed by my previous gastro. Dr. Wilkinson of Derriford Hospital, Plymouth, England, in conjunction with a chemist.
I hope your crohn's is under control. Like you, I am taking Arimidex, but have a long way to go yet as I have only been on it for 8 months. I will be interested to see Leo's reply to your questions.
Take care, Liz.

I felt absolutely rudderless last year when dx with bc as my Crohn's was fairly out of control and the dx of bc sent me into steroid induced psychosis - frightening both for me and my husband. I couldn't find any doctor either in the UK or USA who had treated a patient for the two concurrent diseases to find a precedent for medication whilst undergoing chemo. I am sure there is one out there, but it was like trying to find a needle in a haystack, and I was not successful.

							Wow everybody, I had no idea that there was anyone else out there that was dealing with crohns and bc at the same time... and I have been away this weekend at the Cleveland Race for the Cure.. was really surprised when I stopped in here today.  My oncologist actually did consult with other docs from UPMC.. in Pittsburgh PA.  As Leo stated they are  a very knowledgable group of docs.  I actually was officially diagnosed with crohns 4 years prior to my BC.  and believe it or not the chemo that I recieved actually seemed to help my crohns.. I was taking asacol prior to chemo, and with taxol I also had to take the decadron in place of the NSAIDS for the taxol muscle and bone pain.  After I finished the chemo my body began to have skin reactions to the tomoxifen and the asacol... so I was switched to arimidex and immurane.  I have thankfully experienced remission with the immurane.  My daughter however who was diagnosed at age 20.. has had an awful time, was steroid dependent at one point but has been taking remicade infusions for the past 2 years and it is like a miracle for her.  If any of you are being unsuccessful with your meds then that may be something to look into.. she still has to take the immurane but is so much better now.  Leo it looks like this has taken on a life of its own with the crohns...   However Leo, looks like this is something that you may want to look into a bit, there must be others out there that will present with the same and you may be one step ahead when treating them.    I know how difficult it is to have to deal with both the bc and the crohns and hope you all find that med combo that works for you!  I know that living with crohns disease is a llifestyle in itself.

							Hi

Well, it is certainly interesting to find a group of people with this unusual combination of diagnoses. As I wrote above, given the (unfortunate) high prevalence of breast cancer, one would expect that this might not be to uncommon. But there are so many people with autoimmune diseases that we have to deal with, while at the same time giving chemotherapy. Just treating BC without any other diseases is already a very complex situation. Choosing the right treatment, evaluation, customizing the regimen for each individual patient....I still feel that BC is one of the most difficult cancers to treat, just due to the amount of research and options available. It is extremmely difficult to be up-to-date in this field....

  It is unfortunate that you feel that BC is one of the most difficult cancers to treat, in that obviously this is the beast that we are all dealing with, however it gives me hope.

As a new generation oncologist, and your efforts through this forum, I think that you will take this as a challenge and work that much harder to slay this beast.  Your patients will only be so much better off then those who struggle with their doctors who minimize their side effects, have little empathy for what the struggles are and who do not deliver to them the most important thing, which to me is HOPE... and through this journey I know of alot of men and women who have these other doctors... thankfully not my oncologist, however my breast surgeon told me not to be to upset that I should live for 5 years.. good thing that I had a good oncologist that told me not to listen to the statistics..,  there are quite a few out there that have that a ""God complex""...

One good thing or positive thing is, when you or a loved one is diagnosed with this horrible disease, it forces you to look at life different.   A few examples are,  appreciateing the little things more, not being in such a hurry all the time, takeing better care of yourself,  telling the people you love and care about, that you love and care about them,  dont sweat the small stuff!!!!

							Oh, boy, am I ever glad to have even a small part of the medical community by the ear!   Here's the gripe: doctors know next to nothing about lymphedema--expecially breast lymphedema--and ABSOLUTELY nothing about what this condition does to the people who develop it.  They are negligent about alerting their patients to the possibilities and to the steps they need to take to prevent it; they are slow to diagnose it; they treat it as a minor side effect instead of the devastating, life-long, and often painful diagnosis that it is; they are unfamiliar with the treatment modalities, and they know zip about where to steer patients for the best and most effective treatment.

And while I'm on the subject, the lymphedema therapists themselves seem to be at odds with each other over whose training program is the best and, though there are relatively few of them in any community, they fail to unite to educate the medical community--not to mention the patients--about the availability and importance of their treatment programs.  In a way, it's no wonder the medical community doesn't take those of us with lymphedema seriously, since its practitioners are so busy one-upping each other.  I wish you guys would get your act together on this and not leave all the burden on those of us who are suffering from it.

							Cassie - I agree! I was just coming back here to reply to someone's post wondering what to do about the fluid building up on her arm...because I didn't see a response that explained lymphedema, even from our dear doctor friend, Leo. 

It's definitely a neglected ailment. I'm so glad that I was informed about it... but I still marvel at many doctors' responses when I explain that I have lymphedema. I just want to shake them!   Even people who had only 1 or 2 lymph nodes removed are at risk, and they should be told about lymphedema. Any disruption to the lymph system can cause a problem. I don't know what's so difficult to understand about that! 

I mentioned to my dermatologist (I have melanoma, BTW, not breast cancer) that I wasn't sure I wanted him excising one of the freckles that I suspect is dysplastic... because I have lymphedema in that arm. He knew I had a complete resection of my axilla lymph nodes, and radiation.... but he still said ""What does lymphedema have to do with that?"" It took everything I had not to reply ""I have two words for you -- Mo ron!""

On the other hand, not every doctor is expected to know everything. And his being a dermatologist lets him off the hook. My SURGEONS however, are another story!!!! 

Okay, I'll shut up now.   Except for one thing. If anyone would like to learn more about lymphedema - visit www.lymphnet.org

							Jackie ~ I didn't think 1 or 2 nodes posed any risk.  I had 3 nodes removed during the sentinel node and none of my doctors (rads onc, med onc or surgeon) ever told me there was any risk of lymphedema.  They did not tell me that I shouldn't have blood pressure done on that arm.  Also, I did not have a port and the nurses did use that arm for sticks.  Because of all this, I thought I was ""safe.""  So now I'm finding out that I'm not?  That sounds pretty negligent on the part of the doctors.

							Ok while your on the subject...I have to agree with casse about lack of being informed by the doctors.  While conducting my own research I wanted to learn everything I could about it so I would not get it.  However, I kept running into roadblocks because if you don't have it then nobody wants to talk to you, or they tell you not to worry about it.
So, I think the doctors should be alerting their patients to this possible side effect and if nothing else, give them information so they can do everything to prevent it from ever happening.
Ok, got that off my chest!!!

							Hi all....I know exactly what you are talking about when it comes to this subject.  NOBODY in the medical field wants to discuss it.  Thank god , I have not had any swelling and I am coming up on 4 years post surgery.

Did want to mention a site to get PINK bracelets FREE
www.lymphedema.com
or
1 800 29 EDEMA

I wear one whenever I am travelling or have to go to the doctor or in hospital for a procedure.  It gets everyones attention.  I had appendicitis last year and it came in very handy!!!!

Mine says:  ALERT LYMPHEDEMA
               No Blood Tests, Blood Pressure,
               No I.V. or Injections into this Arm!

Good Luck to everyone

							Hello There!

I am a 42 year old very active, healthy, post BC patient with Lympedema.  I had many bad experiences with the medical cmmunity giving me lots of bad treatment and advice that didn't work -  let me give you a list of what didn't work and what did work for me:

Did not work
Off the shelf (won't say brand sleeves)
They look ugly, and do nothing to reduce the size - after many frustrating expereinces and when the Lympedema nurse (who is highly educated and writes books on the subject) told me to start keeping a journal when my swelling was out of control, I decided to try something new.  That was my last time working with her.

I did find somethings that did work for me:

Lymatic drainage therapy by someone trained in the Vodder method
wrapping (it is sooo much more effective than those sleves and gloves)
custom made-to-measure sleeves and gloves - mine are by Jobst
Nighttime garmet Jovipac (looks like a gigantic ovenmitt) and sleeve that goes over it.

Hope this helps - I went from a sleeve size 3 to a size 1 with these methods.  Also this book I'm reading is a bit radical but seems to have some sound methods: Lympedema - Finding the Holistic Approach by Phillip J. Pollot

Good Luck![/list]

							MY CANCER DOCTORS DID MENTION LYMPHODEMA TO ME JUST A BIT. I MUST SAY THAT NOW 2 YEARS AFTER MY LUMPECTOMY I DO HAVE MILD LYMPHODEMA. THE ONE THAT DID TELL ME ABOUT IT WAS MY PRIMARY CARE DOCTORS NURSE. I HAD GONE THERE BECAUSE OF ANOTHER HEALTH PROBLEM AND WHEN SHE STARTED TO TAKE MY BLOOD PRESSURE I PUT OUT THE ARM ON THE SIDE OF THE LUMPECTOMY. BEING A GOOD NURSE SHE REMEMBER ABOUT MY LUMPECTOMY AND SAID TO ME ISN'T THAT THE SIDE OF YOUR LUMPECTOMY. WHEN I SAID YES SHE WENT ON TO EXPLAIN LYMPHODEMA TO ME AND TOLD ME RIGHT THEN TO GO AND GET A MEDICAL ALERT BRACELET AND WEAR IT ALL THE TIME.  JUST A FEW MONTHS BEFORE THIS I HAD GONE IN TO HAVE A COLONOSCOPY DONE AND THEY HAD USE THE LUMPECTOMY SIDE TO PUT IN  THE IV. MAYBE THAT IS WHY I HAVE THE LYMPHODEMA NOW. I WILL NEVER KNOW FOR SURE IF THAT CAUSED IT OR IF I WOULD HAVE GOTTEN IT ANYWAY.  SO THANKS TO A GOOD NURSE I NOW HAVE THE BRACELET AND NEVER COMES OFF. IT HAS ALL THE INFORMATION ON IT ABOUT NO IV'S, BLOOD PRESSURE ETC.  SO I WOULD TELL EVERYONE TO GET A MEDICAL ALERT BRACELET IT YOU DO NOT HAVE ONE. THEY DO NOT COST THAT MUCH UNLESS YOU WANT A GOLD ONE.

							Doctors are not experts in all fields.  My surgeon could not even come close to answering specific questions related to breast cancer that my oncologist could.  After my mastectomy I woke up with a numb tongue.  My surgeon claimed that it was due to a vitamin B12 deficiency and that it couldn't possibly have anything to do with the operation.  I then contacted the anesthesiologist who sent me to an ear, nose and throat docter; he said that the tube had moved during surgery and was resting on a tongue nerve.  Anyway, the point is that if you have a question, you have to go to the correct specialist.  Surgeons are great at surgery, but they don't know a whole lot about other areas of medicine.[/url][/b]

							Hi all,
Does anyone have any information on MRI results?  I am waiting to be informed of the results of an MRI I had on my right breast last week.  My left breast has already been removed due to invasive ductal carcinoma.  When I called the hospital to request a copy of my MRI report, they told me that they hadn't completed the report yet but they had called my cancer surgeon in New York to discuss something with him and he requested that I bring the actual films with me when I go next week.  My last mammogram six months ago showed some irregular spots that were thought to probably be benign.  I fear at this point that perhaps they are looking more like malignancy.  Waiting is unbearable, especially since I need to purchase airline tickets to visit my family over Thanksgiving, but don't want to do so if I'm going to need another mastectomy.  What kind of benign conditions might produce a white area on an MRI?  If anyone knows, I'd appreciate it.
						

"
"


							Just wanted to let you know I received my MRI report today, and unfortunately there is an area suspicious for DCIS.  I've already lost my left breast to invasive ductal carcinoma, so I'm not happy about hearing that my right is now in jeopardy, but I'm relieved that it doesn't appear to be invasive at least.  There is also another area of my right breast mentioned in the report that is described as an area of stable punctate foci of enhancement that are likely parenchymal.  I am hoping Leo or someone else may be able to explain this for me.
						

"
"


							Tracey,

Sorry to hear about these findings. Anyway, what they can tell from looking at imaging is: is this suggestive or not of cancer ? Is it worth going in for a biopsy ? It seems that the answer is yes for your case. When they mentioned the other area as stable punctate foci of enhancement means only that there is no change from previous exams. Radiologists can only describe what they see. It is the job of the oncologist or clinician to interpret the data and correlate with the clinical situation, and that is sometimes very difficult.

The bottomline is: you have a lesion that is likely malignant, and that you will need something done diagnostically about it. The other area I can't really comment on, your oncologist is certainly the best person to ask.

Obs: sorry I overlooked your post before, it is sometimes difficult to follow all the new threads here and answer them accordingly .

best of luck, and keep us posted !

							I was diagnosed on Sept 14th. Had a lumpectomy on Sept 30th and did not get clear margins. I'm scheduled to have the left breast removed Nov. 3. I dont want this to happen to me again, so I'm highly considering having the right breast removed on the 3rd also.
What do you think?
My doc. thinks that it is a bit drastic because there has not been a detection of cancer in it yet.
My thinking: Living life with my wonderful husband, my 4 yr old and 7 yr old
No more mamograms, biopsies, lumpectomies and sleepless nights waiting for the reports to come back.
Question #2
Does insurance cover the removal and reconstruction of a healthy breast when cancer has been detected in only one breast?
I cant get into see my plastic surgeon until March 14. She has come highly recommended and I have decided to wait for her. 
I spend a  great deal of time in my swimsuit and want to have as much symmetry as possible.
Thank you for your help in answering some very difficult questions.

							Hi,
You didn't say what stage you were or any details, so I'll tell you about me.  I had just turned 43 when I was dx with Stage IIIA Invasive Lobular BC on Valentine's Day of 2002. I had a 5.5 cm tumor and 9+nodes positive out of 16.  I opted for a mastectomy.  A year later after chemo, rads etc. I opted to have the other breast removed.  I was considered high risk because of my age and the stage.  Lobular also is more likely then ductal to mirror itself in the other breast.  I wanted to do everything possible to prevent this beast from coming back, just like you are talking about doing.
My surgeon wrote a letter to the insurance company because I have to have preapproval for ""elective"" surgery.  My surgeon didn't go into alot of details in his letter.  He told them my dx and my desire to have the other breast removed and that HE thought it was a reasonable request.  Insurance approved it.
As to your other question, yes, insurance has to pay for reconstruction even on a healthy breast that is removed.  I tried bi lateral reconstruction with horrible complications, so now I'm boobless, but I'm alive 
I hope this helped some
Please keep me posted
Nancy

							It really isn't drastic at all to have the other breast removed.  There is a rate of recurrence for cancer in the other breast that is based on your current cancer.  If you are younger your breasts are more dense, and finding cancer on a mammogram is more difficult. So, even if you were lucky to find it early this time, you may not be as lucky the next time (if it does come back).

It is easier to create symmetry after bilateral mastectomies.  But you should explore your reconstruction options well to be sure you make the right decision for you.

I had bilaterals with immediate expander reconstruction.  My initial surgery was very painful and I needed quite a bit of help for a while. But others have not had as much pain, and this may vary by body type. I'll be having my exchange surgery soon, and so far things look good.

Good luck!

							Hi

Screening for breast cancer in the remaining breast after a mastectomy is always a must. Having a personal history of breast cancer increases your risk of having breast cancer in the remaining breast. It seems obvious, but there are studies that have shown it. 

Despite not knowing much about your history, there are so many things that should be taken into consideration when making a decision about a mastectomy. Like Nancy, lobular carcinoma is one that is frequently multi-focal. You should estimate your breast cancer risk using the Gail model or the NSABP calculator. The number given will underestimate your risk, because you already have a personal history of breast cancer. Better yet, you should explore with your physician your reasons for you wanting a mastectomy, and his role is to show you the right direction, that's what we doctors do. There is so much junk on the internet that I find it very difficult to find a truly independent analysis of something for non-medical people.

yours sincerely
Leo

							I had a bilat mastectomy 4/30/04 together w/ insertion of tissue expanders. I only had a relatively small Infiltrating Ductal Carcinoma (1.2 cm) in one breast. I had similar outlook to your own about removing both and ""getting it over with"". However, this is a very individual decision, of course. 

I have been fairly lucky as pain was not bad. I did find that one of the pain meds was much more effective for me than the other one, so ask your dr about alternatives. I really don't like meds much so I got off of them as soon as I could. In my case, I was back at the gym in 10 days, taking 3/4 mi. walks on Tues after Fri surgery. This too is highly individual, but just so you know you don't necessarily become immobile.

As I understand it, after a significant march in '97-'98 legislation was passed which assures that those who undergo mastectomies can get reconstruction without it being considered ""elective"". I had no questions from my insurance co (which is frankly a pain in many ways) about the  choice of bilateral mastectomy.

Finally, I too had to wait a bit for my selected plastic surgeon (just several weeks, my surgery was 6 weeks after my biopsy). I am very glad that I waited as she is marvelous and I feel very comfortable w/ her. You will spend a lot of time w/ the plastic surgeon if you undergo reconstruction and imho, it makes it much easier if you are totally confident w/ your choice and able to discuss your preferences clearly.
Good luck!

							Hi my name is Annie. I just registered on this site [that's not working so well right now] I found this url for this site on another bc support group. [alt.discuss group] I was dx in 4/1999 and again in 2002. Recurrance, MRM, followed  by 6 months of chemo[4AC/4Taxotere]

I was replying to a post by ""Nan"" who mentioned a law that requires insurance companies to pay for reconstruction of the mastectomy breast, as well as the remaining breast [as in ""sysmmetry""]
It's legislation that was signed on October 21, 1998 by then President Clinton. It's called ""The Women's Health And Cancer Rights Act"" Or ""WHCRA"" for short for a net search. I hope this helps. I'm now in the middle od a dispute myself with my HMO because I want to have the other breast removed due to stress of having this twice, and would prefer not to have to got through this a 3rd time. Every one of my doctors agrees with me. The one and ONLY hold up is my HMO.
I'm making another run at it shortly. It's been almost 2 years since my last request. I'm hoping the approval process has ""changed hands"" I'm hoping the ""medical director"" has moved on...
Take care everyone

							For those of you that had expanders/implants, did you have radiation?  I had a MRM when dx on Valentine's Day of 2002.  I had a SM in May with bilateral reconstruction.  I did the expanders but the skin wouldn't stretch and the pain was horrible.  The PS went in about 3 months later to remove scar tissue from the radiation and had to remove the expanders.  My skin wouldn't stretch and the expander was literally trying to come back out of my skin around the sternum area.  I was just wondering if it was just my bad luck, or if either of you had radiation and everything is going fine with just expanders.
My skin is SO tight on that side, that the x-ray Monday showed I had 3 healing ribs.  I can't help but believe that it's the pressue from the skin glued to my ribs and no elasticity.

							my father has had liver cancer for 6 months now, and does not qualify for a transplant because the cancer has spread to other parts of the body. (metastatic primary liver cancer)... he had hepatitis c and took  pegalated interferon. during the 11th month of the trial his liver shut down, he was told he had cancer and the hepatitis left him with serious cirrosis. now the doctors have told us to search for clinical trials as there are no more know answers. (he has already undergone liver ablation and chemoembolization and his liver function is not incredibly poor) but my question is, IS THERE ANYONE ELSE OUT THERE IN THE SAME CONDITION? and if so, are they undergoing any kind of successful treatment?? it's no good randomly guessing at clinical trials. also, the doctors keep giving us terrible predictions like he has only a few weeks to live (that was a few weeks ago). can anyone help?

Thanks for sharing your father's story with us. Unfortunately there are no good treatment options for end-stage liver disease other than a transplant. One can live with it for some time, but the complications are so common, and so many organs are affected by the poor liver function, that there are no drugs in the market that really help.

You can try www.clinicaltrials.gov, and see if there are any open trials that could enroll your father. One thing to take into consideration is that the chances of getting a beneficial treatment are small.

							Hi all,
This is a minor kind of pain compared to the type of pain associated with some cancers, but I wanted to let women know that there is pain associated with breast reconstruction following a mastectomy.  The reason I wanted to post this is that I have found that plastic surgeons do not warn of this or educate their patients in this regard.  The pain is not such that it should deter anyone who wants reconstruction from getting it, but it is something that I think would be better tolerated if one was prepared for it.  I was panicked after my surgery because I was in such signficant pain from the tissue expander, and no one had ever mentioned that there would be any pain whatsoever, so I was frightened and convinced that something was terribly wrong.  Also, I wasn't on enough pain medication, because I didn't know I would need to be.  I just wanted to give other women a heads-up about this.

Thanks for mentioning this. Pain is something that people do not have to go through. There are so many ways to alleviate pain, that I can not conceive that in this early century there are still people suffering from acute pain.

							Hello
I currently have tissue expanders follwoing a double mastectomy, and yes there is pain, no one told me how much pain it would be.  I have 50cc of saline injected weekly and I'm almost finished and have scheduled my surgery for implants.  The doctors told me I would be back to work in 3 weeks except for lifting, well its 7 weeks and I'm not back to work, no energy, and my expanders are ""rock hard"" never seem to loosen up between injections, the pain is there at times almost unbearable.  But I would have still made the same decision just wished someone would have told me and I've just started driving, can't go through physcial therapy until implants are in due to scar tissue that they will loosen up at that time.
I am thankful because I do not have to have any radiation or chemo, this too shall pass.  Just wanted to let people know there will be pain with the expanders, especially if you are small built.

							After any type of operation you are likely to feel some pain and discomfort. Women vary greatly in how much pain they have after breast reconstruction. Many women will need pain relief for a day or so after surgery. Make sure you ask for pain-relieving drugs if you need them. There is no need to suffer in silence -- in fact, research suggests that patients with good pain relief recover more quickly after surgery.

You may find it uncomfortable to move the arm on the side where surgery has been carried out. This is particularly likely if you have reconstruction at the same time as surgery for breast cancer and have had some lymph glands removed from your armpit. But it is important that you continue using your arm and carry out the exercises suggested by your physiotherapist.

I think in medications you can take  Arimidex for breast cancer.
however i donr know if it is taken after or before the surgery 
do check with your doctor.

							Hi Tracey, I too had bad pain with my expanders.  I really don't think that the mastectomy was that painful.  The recontuction is what hurt.  My pain was so bad at times I just couldn't take it.  I am 32 years old and was diagnosed at 30.  I am glad I chose to have reconstruction, but please know it is painful.  Like you said the doctors really don't let you in on all the pain.  Now, my problem is, my implants are very uncomfortable.  They never let me forget they are there.  I look back now and it hurt but glad I did it.

							I have a friend in Chicago who is suffering from stage 4 Small Cell lung cancer. Several weeks ago, he underwent a surgical procedure to correct a degenerated vertebra that was eaten away by the cancer. In an effort to maintain his mobility, an interbody spine cage was implanted in the t-1 section to compensate for the lost vertebra. He has since developed a serious infection at the location of the 7 to 9inch-long incision and deep into the wound. Apparently, the infection is growing on the rods of the cage. As a result, he is bedridden in a rehab clinic and unable to enjoy life.

He is on massive doses of antibiotics but the infection is not responding to the treatment. It?s uncertain as to the cause of the infection. Radiation or the surgery itself may be the culprit.  

Might anyone out there have knowledge of this problem? Is there any treatment he should try? Understandably, he wishes to get back on his feet and derive some enjoyment from the time ha has left. Any feedback is greatly appreciated.

Well, I can try to help  I feel sorry for your friend. When you have a foreign body in your body that becomes infected, often the only way to cure it is to remove the infected prosthesis. In case of bones it is even more important, since bones have a poor blood supply, and the antibiotics have a hard time to get there in adequate concentrations. 

Your friend may be in such a condition that the doctors no longer feel that it is safe for him to undergo another procedure. Plus that might cause his spine to be unstable and potentially make things worse. I don't know enough about his history, but it sure sounds like there are few options.

I don't think fosamax could be causing your ocular problems. Uveitis is actually a dangerous condition, an inflammation inside the eye, affecting the uvea. It would cause red eye, tender, and vision problems. But I would check with your opthalmologist and be seen, since it sounds like you are having a problem...

hi saluki! - i am on fosamax too and it didn't occur to me that the medication was giving me any problems; it's been relatively smooth sailing for over a year on it.   however, i suddenly have arthritis in my hands.... and my eyes have been so unbelievably dry for months that i have had to use drops. unlike you, i am not on arimidex nor had any corrective eye surgery.  it never occurred to me that the fosamax could possibly cause that...i had no idea these could be side affects.  makes you wonder....

Didn't even occur to me you were on this.  So, I  looked into it a little more .  this is refering to what was  printed in the New England Journal of medicine last March. 

Osteopororis Drugs Tied to Eye Problems
Rare but troubling woes reported with bisphosphonates

WEDNESDAY, March 19 (HealthScoutNews) -- A class of osteoporosis drugs has been found to cause several eye problems, some of them serious, and researchers say patients should discontinue the medication if they experience any ocular woes.

The drugs, called bisphosphonates, help prevent fractures by slowing down bone loss. The cases of eye problems are rare, says a research letter appearing in the March 20 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine . But they're also surprising, since physician's guides don't list them as a potential side effect.

Bisphosphonates are sold in the United States under the names Fosamax, Actonel, Zometa, Didronel, and Skelid. Ophthalmologists at the Casey Eye Institute, affiliated with the Oregon Health and Science University in Portland, found ocular problems with each one.

The problems include conjunctivitis, abnormal or blurred vision, eye pain, scleritis (an inflammation of the sclera, the outer coating of the eyeball), and uveitis (an inflammation of the uvea, a middle lining that includes the iris). Some of the people taking the drugs experienced more than one of these symptoms, the letter says.

It is the first time any class of drug has caused scleritis, report the researchers, Drs. Frederick W. Fraunfelder and Frederick T. Fraunfelder. The conjunctivitis problems eased as the patients' bodies got more accustomed to the drugs. However, some of the problems didn't abate until the patient stopped taking the drugs altogether, they write.

							I asked my onco Monday about getting on the meds to try and help the bone/joint pain from Arimidex.  He told me that sometimes it actually makes the pain worse, so I guess like everything concerning this disease, it affects everyone different.  I had a bone density on Monday and I'll wait and see what the results are.  I'd be willing to give it a try and see if it helped.  I'd like to feel 45 instead of 145 most days.

							Dear Leo,
I had a lumpectomy last August, for a .8 cm tumor of IDC.My sentinal node, when biopsied, was hot, the next 9 were ok.
My pathology indicated a nasty, very aggressive tumor. I had to have a second surgery the next day, to widen the margins.I'm now 62, and had, previously been completely healthy save some hip& knee arthritis. I had taken HRT for 10 years.
My onc was most aggressive-he treated me with A/C plus Taxotere, 4 of each.He said better hit it hard the first time. Good!
 It was a downhill procedure, by finish my blood was all ""dead"", red & white cells. I was getting Neulasta and Aranspe each chemo, for most of the Taxotere.
I had low platelets, constant nosebleeds, diarrhea,shortness of breath, along with constant URIs, and considerable bone and joint pain.
Early in Taxotere, I began to experience numbness in my fingertips. My nails grew black, and thick.With the numbness, my onc lowered my dose of Taxotere a tad, saying he still wanted it to be thereputic. The numbness went away, though.
Maybe I should add that at 5'5"", I was considerably overweight, since I know drug doses are set by weight. I'm sure I had enough chemo to choke a horse!

So I finished chemo on March 11.

I had a bone scan, and suffered a colonoscopy before I was allowed to meet NED.

Rads began end of April (I begged for a treatment-free month, to recoup a bit)
Also in April I began taking 25 somethings of Aromasin daily. A teeny white pill.

So now, I'm a cripple.AND a mental cripple, as well.Memory-gone!
My knee and hip arthritis got MUUUUUUCH worse. I also now have ankle,wrist, shoulder pain, pain in joints of my fingers, pain in the joints of my FEET! 
NSAIDs help a bit, but I have to rotate them.Cox2s the same-Bextra, Celebrex-they help for a day or 2, then change the drug again.And none of them makes me pain-free.
I've begun taking Claritin-it's been said it helps, for some reason.It does. But doesnt make the pain gone.
I also have the numbness in fingers back. Sounds crazy since my finger joints hurt, but my fingertips are numb!I drop stuff.
My onc gave me Tylenol3, w/codeine, for sleep. It does shut the pain down, but I'm wary of becoming desensitized to it, use it about one night out of 30, when I'm really exhausted.

My onc says he feels a lot of this is still from the taxotere. Some, like the memory loss, and finger arthritis, are obviously (to me) Aromasin side effects-lack of estrogen.
But none of it is helped by drugs, at least OTC drigs, which are the only kind I'll use constantly.
My onc says he hopes I can push through it, and I intend to. Don't WANT to take any more drugs!!

What do I want?Comments, please! From you, and any other docs familiar with Taxotere, and this post-chemo, drug-resistant pain.Does anyone know about holistic therapies? I've started Turmeric, also Cordyceps mushroom, for strength.These are both suggestions from Andrew Weil.
I appreciate any comments or suggestions VERY much!
Thanks, Joan

							Hi Joan,
Sorry you are having so many problems.  I didn't take Taxotere, but I got a very aggressive regime of chemo also, since I was Stage III.  I did have neurpathy pretty bad and the onco put me on Neurotin (RX).  It did help and I still get it every now and then, 2 1/2 years later but very seldom and I've been off the Neurotin for about ayear.

I'm taking Arimidex and oh yea, the bone pain and joint pain, especially my fingers, heals/feet is horrible.  I'm 45 now and it takes awhile to get out of bed and get moving because of the pain when I put pressure on my feet.

I hope this helped a little bit, if for no other reason then you aren't alone
Take care and best of luck

							Hi,

Is there any chance you could just take tamoxifen?  That is why I am taking tamoxifen even though I am postmenopausal.  It's great....only a few hot flashes.  I have never had any joint or bone pain.    Yes,some of your problems may be due to having had the taxotere, but I would guess some of it is probably due to the aromasin.

My QOL has been great with tamoxifen.  I did do chemo, but not taxotere.

I am sorry to hear that you are having so many problems. Neuropathic pain is still something that is difficult to treat. It also seems that you have neuropathy, at least by what you are describing with the numbness. Unfortunately there is no magic bullet for this. There are some drugs that help for neuropathic pain such as gabapentin (Neurontin) and amitryptiline, but these are not 100% effective. Try to talk to your doctor, or even have him refer you to a pain specialist. I am sure they'd be able to help you !

							Joan,  I had serious nuropathy from my taxol.. and took large doses of nuerontin for a long time. Also saw so many doctors for nerve conductivity tests, neurologists, orthopedics etc, etc,  I actually was at the stage that I could no longer walk for any long distance and getting up and down were very painful.  I actually at one point had to get a handicapped placard.  About two years ago I made the decision that I was to young to lose my mobility so much so I actually started to excercise.  I did water aerobics, started walking and working out at the Y.  It was very very slow and very very painful.. however I found that the more that I did the easier that it got and I actually have lost 60 lbs in the process and the best part was that I no longer have the pains in my feet, shoulders etc... I also had eventually been diagnosed with arthritis is the small bones of my feet and my shoulder and hips but I am so much better mobility wise.. dont know if I will ever fully get those brain cells back that go with the memory loss but the other pains are much better.  This was not easy, but I was pretty determined when nothing else worked and I was so tired of it!  Good luck to you!

							Hi Joan and others,
Thanks for this topic. We really don't have enough information about these post-chemo side effects. At least that's what I think is going on with me.

I had 4 dose-dense neoadjuvant treatments of CEF, followed by 12 weekly Taxol treatments ending the last of June 2004. Then, a mastectomy. Then 33 radiation treatments which just ended last week. 

For the last 6 to 8 weeks I have been experiencing gradually worsening upper arm pain. At first, I noticed it when I reached behind to put on sleeves or pick up something or when I extended my arm to fold sheets, etc. Now I notice pain even when resting. Because of the pain I'm not using the arm as much as the other arm. By the way, this is the arm opposite my mastectomy.

My oncologist ordered both x-rays and a bone scan which came back okay. He is supposed to refer me to a shoulder doctor, but that has not happened yet. I guess I'm puzzled as to whether the pain is neurological, muscular or joint. I'm afraid I'm in for a whole bunch of tests.

							Hi Joan,
  I had a similar pain that was but a mystery to me.  A referral to an orthopedic doc came up with the diagnosis of rotator cuff.  This was however in my arm with the lymphedema so I had to have physical therapy to work on it.  After a few weeks of physical therapy the pain subsided and I was able to use the arm again normally.  The pain started out sparadically then worsened to the point hat I could not lift my arm.  I hope that you are able to find out what the cause of your pain is.  keep up updated as to what docs and the cause of your pain... best of luck to you!

							Annie,  My nueropathy started with my taxol.  It was initially a numbing of my fingers and toes...much like they were falling asleep, those pins and needles... eventually it was just in the very tips and then moved upward.  It was difficult to hold things because my fingers seemed to be unable to hold them and I could not feel them.  The numbness eventually disappated as time went on... many months after for me... but the numbness was replaced with a throbbing pain, much like if your fingers and toes were frozen from the cold that pain that you feel when you they start to warm up.  I thought that the numbness was bad but this pain was worse.  Eventually I could hardly walk due to the awful pain in my feet.  I saw couple of nuerologists, orthepedic guys and even a podiatrist, who gave me a shot of cortisone in each foot.. which worked for a while but the pain was worse when that was wearing off.  I also was taking arimidex which could have also added to this pain... as that bone pain is a side effect of arimidex.  I was also diagnosed with arthritis in the small bones of my feet.. have no idea what may have caused this the nueropathy, the arimidex, chemopause, old age (I was only 47 at the time) or chrons disease which effects bones and joints as well... so that is what my experience with nueropathy has been... all gone now... good luck to you!  Keep us posted as to what you find out.

							Hi,
If the question was to me about taking Tamoxefin instead of Arimidex because of the side affects, then I'll answer...lol
I took tamoxifen for 6 months until it was determined that chemo put me into MENTALpause at 43.  I was stage III and because of my stage and age, I was/am?  high risk and all the studies have showed that Arimidex is superior to Tamoxifen.  I had horrible hot flashes and night sweats with Tamoxifen and none with Arimidex.  I had a bone scan done yesterday and everything is fine, thank God, which means all of the pain is from Arimidex.   can deal with the pain alot easier then this beast coming back, that's for sure.

							Hi Lucy - don't know the answer to your questions, but can so identify with them. My twin brother was diagnosed with an inoperable brain tumour when he was 50 years old. Went to a university hospital in London, UK,. and they said it was a secondary from lung cancer. Despite numerous MRI and CT scans, they never found the primary in his lungs.
He died within 11 months of diagnosis. I have breast cancer, hopefully in remission, but I didn't know anything about cancer when my brother died, not that I think it would have made any difference as we believe it was caused by cellular radiation - he was the UK's first Technical Manager for a cellphone company and lived with a cellphone on his right ear! My husband and I, and my sister, refuse to use cell-phones. Make of that what you will, but my husband was involved in radiation in the Ministry of Defence some 50 yrs ago, as was my brother in law, and they are both convinced that Bill's tumour was caused by radiation.

I wish you and your mother well - wish I could be of more help.

							Hi

A problem that we not uncommonly encounter is a cancer of unknown primary origin. It has been shown in studies that if the primary site is not found by conventional means (imaging, colonoscopy, endoscopy etc), the prognosis is really poor. We do not know why this is, but it may indicate that the tumor has such a malignant potential with very early metastasis, that treatments that have been tried have been unsucessful. 

I wish I had better news, but this problem is not new in Medicine, and unfortunately we have made little progress so far.

Thank you for your reply.  I am so sorry to hear about your twin brother and I am praying your breast cancer is indeed in remission.
Cancer sure is auful, huh?  I have a great respect for those who choose the cancer related fields to work in.  I don't know if I could do it.  
Leo, thank you also for the reply.  I was thinking that not finding my mother's primary source of cancer would be good news.  But the reality is that it may not be.  I so appreciate your honesty about that.  I have always had a weird feeling that this may be a pretty bad road to come.  I am a realistic person who likes the facts.  I don't want to spend time being in denial about her prognosis.  My brother keeps thinking that this is not too bad of a thing that my mom has.  He talks of it being no problem for her to ""kick this thing""  His reaction to this kind of scares me.  It may be his way of dealing with it but I wonder if it is healthy for him to be sort of denying that she is so ill.  According to my mothers dr.s, there is no cure for this and less than 2 percent live for 5 or more years.
Thank you for providing such a wonderful site to help people.  I hope soon that more people find this site.

I appreciate your comments. Definitelly people have very diverse ways of dealing with bad news. It is good to stick to the facts and know the truth about the disease, but another important thing is not to lose hope, since that is what drives people. And don't let anyone tell you that ""nothing can be done"", since there is always something that can be done, even if it's not targeting the tumor anymore, but emphasizing keeping the patient comfortable.

							Hello Dr. Leo:

Thank you for this Forum and your concern for cancer patients.  I'm new to breast cancer.  I don't have enough information about my diagnosis or the outcome of my surgery yet, or let's just say that I have no idea how to convey it in the terms that are used around these forums.  After being around the chat room and forum on breastcancer.org, my head is reeling.  None of what they talk about has been discussed with me and my surgeon's office set up appointments for me; with a radiation oncologist on the 25th and a medical oncologist on the 26th.  When my surgeon gets back from vacation, I will see him again and I'm afraid that I won't know the right questions to ask.  This is a whole new world for me and I'm having a very difficult time understanding all of this.  The more I read, the worse it feels.

							Hi Unsure,
Unfortunately, that is exactly what seemed to happen to me.  Immediately after my biopsy of an area of what appeared to be DCIS, I developed a rapidly growing tumor.  My doctor kept assuring me that studies have shown that the biopsy doesn't spread cancer cells, however, there don't seem to be any studies on whether the procedure somehow stimulates the cancer by some other means.  At any rate, I don't think there's any other way to diagnose you unless a piece of the tissue is taken and analyzed in a lab.  So, even if there are risks associated with the procedure, your only other choice is to agree to a mastectomy or lumpectomy without knowing for sure whether you even have cancer.
I hope this is helpful in some way....Good luck.
						

"
"


							These stereotactic biopsies have measures to prevent ""contaminating"" the tract with neoplastic cells. Special care is certainly taken to avoid these issues. Also, if the biopsy results come back as malignant tissue, you will need some form of surgery, but I wouldn't worry about the above-cited issue right now.

good luck !!

							I've heard that people with Blood Type A are more prone to cancer, I read it in the book ""Eating Right for Your Blood Type"" by Dr. Peter D'Adamo.  I'm not sure what the proof behind it is.  I happen to be Blood Type A and have breast cancer.  I did find that by following a few of the dietary suggestions in the book I started to feel better, have less indigestion, etc., though it didn't rid me of cancer of course!   The dietary recommendations also worked for a close friend who is Type A and had such problems with heartburn that she was on a daily prescription medication for several years, despite only being in her thirties.  She made some of the dietary changes and was able to go off her medication.

							Dear Unsure:  You have asked a valid question regarding contaimination and spreading of cancer cells with the needle biopsy.  My internist thought the same thing.  I wanted him to order the biopsy as my surgeon was on vacation for two weeks.  I was reassured from the breast center coordinator who is a nurse that there were no studies which would suggest this.  Otherwise, why would they even do them in the first place? One would think all the pressure from the mammogram would do it as well. After talking with the surgeon my internist did order the biopsy and I will take my films and see the surgeon today since they found invasive ductal carcinoma.  Keep the faith and asking any and all questions.

							I have what may seen like a very obvious question, but it is troubling to me.  I was diagnosed in Jan 04 with stage 2 BC (mixed pathology of IDC, ILC and some in-situ).  have done a mast, chemo (dose-dense) and just finished rads.  I am 46 - have 2 sisters.  My older sister (who will be 50 this year) is taking this very seriously - has had mammograms since age 40 and immediately talked to her doc about her risk now that she has a sister with BC (no other family history of any CA in our family).  My other sister (age 43) has never had a mammogram and resisting getting one.  She has a 3 year old child she is still nursing and uses that as her excuse (i'm sure the child would be happy to give up nursing - she is the one holding on).  How much does her risk increase now that she has a sibling with BC - how much should we be pushing her??  thanks,  Cathy

							Cathy,

As you know, the fact of having a first-degree relative with breast cancer increases her risk of breast cancer.

A well-known and validated approach to estimate her risk is the NSABP model, available at the NCI website at: http://bcra.nci.nih.gov/brc/start.htm

This may be able to give you some numbers to talk to her. I feel that it is very important that she has adequate screening with mammograms. For first degree family members, screening should begin 10 years before the age of diagnosis of the index patient, which means 36 years in your case.

good luck !

our great-grandmother had bi-lateral radical mastectomy way back when, our aunt died after a 20 year battle with bc at age 72 and myself who was diagnosed at age 38w stage 4 bc.  there was one generation that skipped due to the fact that there were no female children.  my grandfather got prostate cancer at an early age, however.  i understand there may be similar mechanisms between bc and pc.

							Hi Lee - I was dx Jan 03 with invasive ductal cancer, with associated nuclear intermediate grade DCIS. I had a lumpectomy Feb 03 and 8 sample nodes dissected. 2 were cancerous, so I had total axillary clearance March 03, 1 more cancerous, so 3/18.  The tumour was 2 cm, ER+, don't know about PR and HER2 as they didn't test. I had some complications after both surgeries, probably because I was taking methotrexate for Crohn's. I had infections in the wounds, and a bad seroma in my back caused by the ""brutal"" surgery as my surgeon put it, to get at all the lymph nodes. I then had 6x FEC chemo, and 25 rads, with 2 boosters. Mammo in March 04 showed no recurrence thankfully.

   Why do you think you have a loss of appetite. Is it one of the meds you are on? Is weight an issue or are you alright having lost that much?

Sorry that you had so much trouble after your surgery. Sounds like that was alot of added stress. Thanks for sharing your story.

							I am now almost five month post op extensive colon resection for a cancer, feeling much better but have a real problem with diarrhea.  I have been told I may have this for life.  At this time I'm using Kaopectate but would like to ask if perhaps this will get better with time or can I really expect this to last forever?

Thanks for sharing your story. Diarrhea after colon surgery is a big problem, and it is exactly like you've been told. It may or may not resolve. The colon essentially serves as a reservoir for stools, and also absorbs water. So when you do not have that anymore, the small bowel tries to adapt to serve this function, and it may take time, and it may not be the way it was when you had your colon. There is no way to predict how it will work.

 Dear Pat,
          I am also 5 months post op. I have some severe problems, but I must admit I am much better than 2 months ago or even last month. I have found that 2 metamucil pills or citrucil pills in the morning seem to stop (or sop) up my loose bowels.   I have sessions which I call bowel attacks where I will have as many as 35 or 40 firm stools in a couple of hours, until finally all that is left is a watery stool. I assume I have completely emptied out, because I don't do anything again for 3 or 4 days, which isn't good either.

         There are embarrassing moments when I can't control what is forcing itself out, or passing gas or leaking through lighter colored slacks. This is tough, isn't it?

          What works for one doesn't work for another, I hear. Everyone is made to suffer differently because of the different locations of the surgery and extent of tumors we had.  I believe all of us do achieve some sort of compromise acceptance of our altered condition and move one sooner or later.  I have fought some depression over this as well, but it's gone now too.

          Good luck to you! I am totally empathetic.

							Pat,

I sympathize greatly with you.  It has now been three plus years for me, and while things are not normal for me (and may never be), things have finally improved.  It did, however,  take over two and a half years for me to start feeling as though I did not have to be attached to a bathroom.  I also, as did Russell, go through a period of terrible depression, but the support of those on the Cancer Society's website helped me through that.  One way I dealt with the situation was to either not eat, or eat very little if I wanted to leave the house!  Definitely not a long term solution, but the walls do start closing in!  I therefore have been unemployed all this time, but luckily have a husband who understands and continues to work many extra hours to make up for it.  I am, however, hoping to get a job very soon (as soon as my next round of testing is done).  
I am very disappointed about the lack of available information about this whole problem, both pre and post-op.  None of the help I've gotten about this was from my own doctor, only from other colon cancer survivors.

							Hi Pat,   
I can sympathize with you. 
I also experienced severe diarreah. 
My oncologist prescribed Lomotil 2.5 mg. He allowed me to adjust the dosage according to the severity of the diarreah. 
I'm thankful, I had my last chemo treatment the first of October 2004. It took about 2 months for the diarreah and nausea to subside. I still experiance some symtoms occasionnally. But, I have learned what foods trigger an episode and I take medication before I eat. Then, if I have diarreah, I take another dose.
I hope you're doing better and have no other complications.
Have a great day,

							Hi Pat,

My husband was operated 2 years ago now. 
He can say - like you - that this diarrhea period is really problematic.
It took one year to improve. Now he has a regular function, but he is careful about the diet : balancing vegetable meal with rice or potatoes or spaghetti everyday. When diarrhea comes, he eats rice for 24 or 48 h then eats a small portion of vegetable or fruit to avoid constipation (or he drinks very much - tea or water or herbal tea).

The bowels rythm became regular step by step; nothing very spectacular.
But he eats small servings (5 per day, to get enough of daily needs), balancing the 1rst with the next.

He goes to toilets (excuse my triviality) normally. His real problem is that it happens at night (hard to sleep in this case, and work after such a night). 
Another work is to do to ""change"" the bowel rythm (but I still don't know how. If someone can give me a piece of advice  )

Hope those small habits will help you. You have to be patient but bowels can be ""educated"" with the time.

All my best

							Hello, I just joined up looking for answers to this question... my doc lead me to believe I'd be feeling better in a few months so reading this is very depressing. I'm 28 and 3 weeks out of my resectioning surgery. Mine too was very low. I have serious problems with pain right now. I have to go about 30 times a day and am afraid to move around because it seems to trigger things. Will this get better? I ride dirt bikes and spend a lot of time outside not around bathrooms, can I look forward to getting my life back? Any help is greatly appreciated.

							Yzforce,

The first three months after I was re-connected so to speak (had a temporary illiostomy for six months) I was like many others using the bathroom 20 plus times a day.  It does get better, in a nut shell your system needs to adjust to what you underwent.  I had pre-operative radiation to decrease the size of the tumor I had due to it being so low lying.  Because of that my large intestine has sustained some radiation damage which also contributes to the good and bad days that I have.  I had my last surgery in May 01, and it took about 2+ years to get things somewhat back to ?normal? for someone who has had rectal cancer.

I have had problems with pain very similar to what you describe.  I was on several different pain medications and the one that has worked well for me is B&O (Beladona and Opium) suppositories.  It has helped control the number of bowel movements that I have and it helps relieve the pain.  I would highly recommend this if you are having pain around the rectum or anus.  If you decided to take this I would recommend adding some sort of fiber supplement to your diet to help deal with the possible constipation that you may have.

As far as your daily life right now, if it has only been three to six weeks, three months from now you will notice a big improvement, it just takes time for your system to adjust.

Hope this helps

							I'm new to breast cancer. I found a small, sore lump on my right breast some time in mid-August, and decided to wait until menstruation to see if was the typical tenderness during PMS.  I started a new job (had been out of work for almost a year) and even though I did not have insurance, I knew that I needed to get checked because it was still there even after I started my period.  My doctor was on vacation.  I saw his nurse practitioner 9/1, who sent me on 9/8 for a mammogram, and while I was there, the radiologist and by the time I had my appointment on 9/16, I had the x-ray and report in hand, and he performed 4 biopsies that day, and a week later on 9/29, he admitted me for a lumpectomy with sentinel node surgery.  The sentinel node was positive and another node had ""a tiny millimeter"" so he also removed 17 nodes under my arm and that all were negative. He shared this from my pathology report on 10/7.  He said this is ""good news"" and he also removed the drain.  I was glad to have it out, but I was hurting all weekend from pressure and swelling.  I have appointments set for 10/25 with a radiation oncologist and 10/26 with a medical oncologist.

I'm lost and scared and I'm feeling very overwhelmed with all this information I'm reading on these boards - and most of the time it's TOO MUCH information. No one even told me that if I lost my breast that I had to have a plastic surgeon lined up ahead of time!  I was lying in pre-op when I learned this!  My head has been reeling for weeks now and this weekend I felt the walls crashing in around me and I cried like a baby all weekend. 

My surgeon is on vacation this week, and I want to ask questions, but I do not even understand my diagnosis so I don't know what to even ASK.  I don't even know why I'm here either, because I'm not even able to share more than I just did.  I see how well prepared many woman are on these message boards, and I now know that I am truly lost.  How do people think clearly so soon after hearing traumatic news like this?  This is a whole new world for me and to make matters worse, I just moved to Indiana a few years ago and I have no support system in place here.  I was introduced to a couple of ladies from the American Cancer Society, but they told me they aren't ""up on all the latest"".  I wish I had one of these knowledgable ladies from these message boards nearby to help me through this.

   So sorry you are feeling so lost, I was where you are 4 months ago. I had a 2.4 cm tumor and 1 node involved. This was the scariest time I have ever had in my life. There were days that I was not  sure that I was ever going to stop crying but I have. I even find my self laughing ona lot of days. I have just finished 4 months of chemo ( dose dense ) 4 a/c and 4 taxol. I also have crohns which caused some problems during chemo. I know you feel like this is the end of the world but its not. Are you married? You need to take it one day at a time. I looked only for information that told about my cancer and that was it because anything more then that I could not handle. I was lucky I have a wonderful support team. 
   I am wondering where this forum comes from it is 5:30 am where I am at and this post says 8:30 on the 12th.  
    I wish I could hold your hand and help you through this I know just how you are feeling. Keep taking a deep breath. I will be heading out to work soon but will check back when I get home to see if you have been back. I will try to help in any way I can even if you just need a shoulder to cry on.  I truely do know how you are feeling. I wish you the best.

							Hi,

Welcome, but I'm so sorry you have to even be at the forums.  I do remember when I was diagnosed it was a total shock - never sick a day in my life.  Everything moves so quickly at first, but things will slow down and you will be able to deal with this.

An excellent book for information is ""Dr. Susan's Love's Breast Book.""  I highly recommend it.  Sometimes information can be scary but it is in your best interest to research and be proactive in your treatment.

Also, do you have a friend or relative, someone you trust, that you can bring along to the appointments with you?  It's hard to assimilate so much information when you are alone and frightened and confused.  It's also comforting to have someone there with  you.

You should ask your doctor for a copy of your pathology report if you don't already have one.  This will dictate what your treatment will be for the long haul.

Try and stay calm and remember this is bad but not the worst thing that could happen.  The majority of women have their cancer treated and it never recurs.  So there is LOTS of hope down the road.

When you get scared, come here and we will hold you hand.

I am so sorry that you find your self in the state of ""LOST"".. It may seem to you that all the womens messages that you read here seem to have it together or that we know so much but be assured that we all have been where you are.. including the shock, anger, depression and total confusion. I never found a support board until I was two weeks away from finishing my chemo.. It was my family and my very few friends that had to pull me through. I like you had moved (from NH to PA) a year and a half before my diagnosis. You have been given good advice about Susan Love's book, getting copies of all your reports, and bringing someone with you to appt. with every single question written down in a list that you go through one by one. I still do that even almost 6 years out. If there is a breast cancer or any kind of cancer support group in your area it is good to attend that as that person to person support is great. I have been through lumpectomy, mastectomy, chemo, radiation, more chemo, tomoxifen and arimidex. I will tell you that it is not easy but it is all doable. You are going to find out that you are much stronger then you ever thought you were. There are times that you dont think that you can do another thing and you will be at the lowest point physically and emotionally but you will find that you can do it and will be empowered in a way that will be amazing. We all seem like we have it together only because we have fought this battle and have learned as we have gone along. The great part of this forum is that we have Leo walking this path with us now and to have a medical professional giving us input is an awesome thing. Your going to get through this, we will help with any questions that you might have and you will be giving out your advice and support to another newbie in no time. Feel free to email me at any time BFagan2067@aol.com, just put in subject line, from BC forum...best of luck to you, take a deep breath and hang in there!

Even before my post, you can see that even though this forum started less than 1 month ago, there are already people that can help you go through this. 

Having been diagnosed with cancer is certainly a big deal, and there is a lot of information available, some of it creates even more confusion. You can try to get organized, get all the information that you know about your cancer and you are more than welcome to ask any questions here. 

Even when you feel that you are overwhelmed, you can be certain that it will get better and you will get through this.

Thank you for your thought filled words.  I have invited my very best friend (out of state) here to this Forum and the breastcancer.org Forum so she could help me sort through all this information.  She was by my side through my surgery, and has been my lifeline since my diagnosis.  I don't know what I would have done without her.  I think having her join in here where she can ask questions that I might not think to ask, will be a big help to me, and then we can talk about things after.  It's not easy to explain things you're reading here to someone, when you don't even understand what you're reading!

							Hi Diane,
The feelings you are having are totally normal, but I know that doesn't help right now.
I was dx 2/14/02 with Stage III Invasive Lobular with a 5.5 cm tumor and 9+ nodes out of 16.  
Just a week prior to my biopsy, because of abuse, things were in motion for me to get a divorce.  When I heard the news and being away from family (I moved to where he lived and worked when we got married) and friends and no support, it was beyond overwhelming.
I can't tell you when, but at some point, you'll get mad at this disease and then you'll be in the fight mode and you will fight this beast like you never thought possible.
I promise you a couple of things.  You WILL get through this!!!!!!! and 2nd, the living and breathing cancer does slowly get less and less.  I know I'm high risk because of stage and age, but it's been over 2 1/2 years and I'm doing great.  There will come a time you don't wake up thinking about it and you don't go to sleep thinking about it.
There's not one person that's had this disease that hasn't gone through the emotional roller coaster ride from hell and we're all here for you.  These words may seem empty right now, but remember, we've all been where you are right now and were just as scared as you are and we truly do understand!!!!!!!!!!
You've got us to lean on and lean all you want, we have strong shoulders.
I'm 45 now and had a double mastectomy and my reconstruction didn't work, but I can honestly say I've never regretted doing it and it really doesn't bother me to be boobless because I'm alive and all they are, are blobs of skin and fat.
You don't have to make a decision about reconstruction right now, it can be done anytime.  Try to take things as they come and don't load yourself down anymore then this disease puts on you.  One day at a time my friend.

							Three years ago my nephew had a mole removed from his head (he had this mole his entire life) the mole contained T cells and further tissue removal was necessary.  Now at age 7 he went to the dr. to have 2 changing freckles looked at (without knowing his history) the dr. ordered immediate removal... they are being removed today. I am concerned as 3 members of his dads family have had melanoma.  I am unable to find any documentation re: children and skin cancer... is it possible?

							Hi

There have been familial syndromes related to myeloma. Please see excerpts taken from Up-to-Date:





			
				Some familial cases occur in the setting of the familial atypical multiple mole and melanoma (FAMMM) syndrome, also called the dysplastic nevus syndrome (DNS). This syndrome was originally described in two kindreds in which affected subjects had multiple (over 100) dysplastic (atypical) nevi, and their lifetime cumulative incidence of melanoma approached 100 percent [5,6]. A family history of melanoma in multiple first degree relatives, and younger age at diagnosis are important components of this syndrome. The median age at diagnosis in one series of 23 kindreds was 33, well below that in patients with sporadic melanomas; this difference may be due in part to increased surveillance of subjects from affected families [7]. However, since there is wide clinical variability in the nevus phenotype (such as size and number of moles and degree of irregularity in border and color), there is currently no consensus as to a formal definition of the ""atypical mole/melanoma"" syndrome.
			
		

So there is a link, especially in the family that you described. You should have your nephew see a geneticist to be sure.

							I would say its definitely possible and when the topic is cancer, I would say take it very seriously until it is completely ruled out.  Much easier to stop it when it's early than to fight it when it is more developed.  It is definitely plausible, although rare for a child to develop skin cancer.  I had a fairly severe case of melanoma when I was 12 and pulled through it after ~1.5-2 years of treatment off/on.

							I realize the original post is quite old.  If this post isn't appropriate, mods please feel free to remove it.

I have identical 14 yr old twin boys, both of whom have numerous moles over their bodies. I noticed about a yr or so ago that the one boy had a patch of gray hair. Since then I've noticed about 5-6 spots on his head that have about 20 or more gray hairs. Each cluster of gray seems to sprout from a light coloured non-raised mole. I've taken him to our doctor who admitted he'd never seen something like this and is in the process of researching it. He said it's likely nothing of concern but will probably refer him to a dermotoligist to rule out skin cancer. Unfortunately - it could take several months to get in to see one. I should also add that he also has several body moles with white rings around them, which I pointed out to the doctor. 
Family history of skin cancer, as far as I know is only 1 maternal uncle, of many relatives although other cancers are very prevelent on the faternal side as are a large number of moles.
Obviously we're rather concerned, especially. I've seen premature graying in teens - but it seems very odd to me given they're identical twins, no history of pre-mature gray in family, and sprouting from numerous moles.

Unlike the original post - they were not 'born' with numerous moles - isn't that what nevi is?  The moles began showing up at about age 3. 
I've been unable to find any info on something like this elsewhere.

							Hello

I wasn't aware of his work. I do not, however, think that this is appropriate. I read his webpage in some detail, and I am not convinced at all. I also searched Pubmed to find how well published this doctor is. Well, it seems that he is not well-published at all, as a matter of fact, there is only 1 paper published in a second-line journal about his triple-blockade regimen. He is not even associated with an academic institution, but he has all his trademarks and customized regimens that people can only get from him. 

To be able to support any treatment, there has to be evidence published in a major, peer-reviewed journal. For example, in his webpage, he still recommends cox-2 inhibitors to ""prevent"" cancer, even now that we know that Vioxx is actually a drug that can cause signifficant problems. Of course, no one could know that it was dangerous before the data was released, but there is also no data available that supports that people should be on COX-2 inhibitors. So just an example for you to understand why we think that way.

Well,  he went through the treatment and is 100% free of prostate cancer.  I don't remember the name of the doctor but I did go with him to the doctor for 'injections of hormone.""  He does have to take pills for the rest of his life though.  I also know the he started getting man boobs too.  LOL

I have numerous questions to ask even before I meet with my surgeon again and I'll probably sound like a complete idiot here.  

My surgery was 14 days ago and I am still having a great deal of pain and some swelling in my breast and my arm.  He saw me last week and removed my drain.  I was in a lot of pain over the weekend, but it has let up some.  I still can't extend my arm all the way out because it feels like there's a knife in my arm.    

I don't know anything about chemo.  Are there different chemotherapies?  How do I know which one I will need?  What does 4 a/c and 4 Taxol mean?  What is ""dose dense chemo""?  What are ""rads""?  Is that the number of radiation treatments?

I want to learn about my cancer, but I can only take in a little at a time.  I am in awe when I observe how some of these women just jump in and take charge of their disease and treatment.  I've read ""do your homework"".  I'd be happy to do my homework, but I don't even know the answers to the questions that everyone else around here seems to know and my surgeon is on vacation this week.  All I've been doing is crying.  I feel frightened, alone and frustrated because I am a very independent woman and have a lot of work to do, and angry because this disease is messing everything up!

							Hi Dianne,
So sorry to hear your doctor is on vacation at this stressful time.  I wanted to assure you that you don't have to worry quite as much as you are about not understanding everything right this minute.  Most of us were totally ignorant when we were diagnosed, and learning about your disease is part of the process.  It is the job of your doctors to educate you, but they will only offer so much information (due to schedules that are too busy to allow much time for you).  The internet is a great place to get extra information, but you have to be careful to realize that not everything you read on every site is accurate or up to date.  I don't think you have to worry much about the different types of chemo; your oncologist will tell you which one will be the most effective against your cancer.  What you should consider for yourself are the pros and cons of having chemo since there are a lot of long term side effects and risks, and also consider the alternatives.  One thing to ask your oncologist about is whether you would be able to receive a shot to suppress your ovaries instead of chemo.  This is supposed to be just as effective as chemo when combined with tamoxifen, but most oncologists don't offer it as an alternative unless you ask about it.  Also, it is only for premenopausal women, and I don't know your age.  Just take your time and do some reading, you will find that the whole picture starts to slowly come together.  And of course you can ask all the questions you want here, any time, 24/7.  All the best to you!

							Hi

I am sorry to hear about your mother. Pancreatic cancer is unfortunatelly not very responsive to any treatment, unless it is localized. 

But I hope she experiences some reponse to alternative chemotherapy regimens, and she can have her symptoms controlled.

I'm sorry to hear about your mother. My boyfriend also has stage 4 pancreatic cancer.

Most of the alternative chemos consist of Gemcitibine + one or more other chemo agents. Mark is getting a moderate response from Gemcitibine in combination with Xeloda and Taxotere.  

It is important to remember that none of these chemo treatments are considered curative, there is no curative treatmet for Stage 4 pancreatic cancer. If your Mom is feeling well at the moment, you amy want to keep in mind that the alternative chemo may be harsher than the Gemcitibine and may make her sick during what would otherwise be the last good months of her life.  Mark was pretty sick at the time of his diagnosis so we decided on the alternative chemo, and it has kept is condition stable for about 5 months now -- he is tired alot and sleeps more than normal and has lots of digestive problems, but he is able to get out and do things most days and has a decent appetite, and the chemo has done alot in terms of keeping the pain away.

I don't think any of the alternative chemos are officially approved for pancreatic cancer.  You may want to check out www.clinicaltrials.gov even if she isn't interested in joining a clinical trial, it will give you  good idea of the therapies that the doctors are finding promising. Most of these are drugs approved for other cancers so her doctor could prescribe them off-lable without her having to join the trial.

The chemo nurses and technicians have also beenvaluable resources for us, they are often more knowledgable about the pros and cons of the various options than the docs.

YOu may also want to look into some of the immunological and biological therapies being tested. These hold some promise of being as effective as the chemos without most of the side effects. Most of them are still in clinical trial, and being new drugs they generally aren't avalable outside of the trial. There is one drug, Virulizin, that is in a stage 3 trial that is full and the manufacturer has a compassionate use policy and will give the drug to pancreatic cancer patients that want to try it.  This may be a possibility for other drugs as well.  

All this aside, the bottom line is that none of these other therapies have been officially proven effective for pancreatic cancer, despite promising early results.

In the meantime, make the best of the time you have.

God Bless

							My Mum also has pancreatic cancer, diagnosed April. She's now on her second programme of chemo after the first one (Gemcitabine) didn't work. 

It was a shock that the first lot of chemo wasn't effective; we were measuring its 'success' by how perky she was and how few side effects she got. Her hair loss was surprisingly significant (Gemcitabine's not known for this) and of course, her weight loss added to the physical effects of cancer, but we felt she was doing well. We felt naive when we were told that clinically, it had not produced the results that the doctors wanted in order to continue with treatment.

Mum is now on combined therapy: Carboplatin every three weeks and twice a day, she's taking Capecitabine tablets which is a combination that's seen in a more traditional treatment for colonic cancer. The tablets were an option offered next to CFU which would have meant attaching a pump 24/7 via a Hickman line. The only difference being that tablets must be bought privately while the CFU is on the NHS.

Largely, the advantages of the tablets rested with convenience, because medically, CFU and Capecitabine are similar. Taking two tablets twice a day is far less intrusive than having to carry a pump around, sleep with it and let it curb the chance for baths (which Mum enjoys and uses every day as  a means of pain management) and carefree showers. 

Also, as the risk of blood clots and infection is increased by the use of a Hickman line, we decided it would be preferable to keep these at an absolute minimum, if we could. 

Complications arising from Mum's cancer also means that she has to endure a rapid growth rate in unwanted liquid that forms in her stomach, (in the third space). This causes a lot of discomfort because it gets taut and grows so she looks like she's maybe four months pregnant, which at 63, isn't quite the look she was going for! Anyway, this liquid has to be drained regularly which again, increases the risk of infection because it needs a surgical line-in.

I've been freaking out every time she goes in to hospital with this MRSA scare. Last time I was watching the cleaners flaff about like they were scared of getting their Marigolds dirty, and I felt like battering them, or doing it myself! Terrible how easy it is to become obsessive with this sort of thing when before the diagnosis, I probably lived among my dust and bugs and cobwebs prefectly happily!

I wish more people who have direct experience of pancreatic cancer would make some comments here.... Unlike very many other forms of cancer it seems, pancreatic cancer doesn't get the research investment that many of the others do, which really pisses me off. Sometimes, I think you can spend too much time reading up on this stuff though and everyone's so different that no two cases are identical. That said, I do draw some comfort - is that the right word? - from understanding what's going on / how we - as carers - can help to improve quality of life and contribute to the overall well-being.  

So far, I've found these sites useful:
http://www.pancreaticcancer.org.uk/ (A new one for the UK)
http://www.pancan.org (A well-established one, US.)
http://www.liv.ac.uk/surgery/helping.html (Liverpool University for research, but if your browser is like mine, their page is barely legible and it just makes them look a little back-street, which is a shame.)

Is there anyone else apart from we three out there?

							I'm sorry your loved one has pancreatic cancer.  My thoughts and prayers are with you.
My mother who was 68, was diagnosed with pancreatic cancer on May 9th and on May 18th, she died from it.  It spread so quickly to her liver and stomach and she was in so much pain.  I miss her very much and now I wonder if I will get it too.  I've been having back pains for years and it comes and goes.  (Probably just from losing and gaining weight)
My mother was a terribly heavy smoker, diabetic, terrible eater and had hbp and a bad heart.
 
I know my mother is in a better place now and free from the awful pain she was put through.  I will say this though, she complained to her doctor for over a year that her back hurt and yet the doctor ignored her pain.  No x-rays were even taken to see why her back hurt.  The Kaiser doctors just gave her pain pills to shut her up.
						

"
"


							I lost my mother to Pancreatic Cancer four years ago. She lasted three months afer being diagnosed.

The worst part is that the doctors saw a mass on her pancreatic organ months before, but they said it disappeared again, so they never brought it up to me. When it reappeared, they failed tomention it to anyone again. 

They were treating her for diabetes, which she did not have (A misdiagnosis which proved to be fatal in the end)

She worked with me, when I was a child, to overcome a learning disability. I read everything backwards. I graduated from High School with a major in Engish Literature, reading at college level while in my Sophmore year. I'm an MCSE, CCNA, and work for a major Aerospace firm now. She was my reason for trying when everyone thought I was mentally deficient, and a waste of time.

Don't get me wrong, please. I'm not an egghead. Actually, I'm far from that. I'm part of a search and rescue team of volunteers in Northern California, although I live in the Southbay area. I owe everything I am to her. I wish she could see me now.

I think about her all the time. When I lost her, I realized that I had lost the only unconditional love a person will ever know in this world. God, I miss her so much!

I have some thoughts you might find a comforting, but would rather not make public. I don't know if they'd be dignified. Maybe you can give your opinion If you're interested, my email is listed as kenberg@comcast.net

If it will make you feel any better in the mean time. Your chances are slim as far as heredity. There are good phyiological reasons for this.

							I am sorry am not quite sure what I did there, I was reading your story and some how managed to post in again. SORRY!

My dad died of pancreatic cancer on the 2nd of january. He was first diagnosed on the 13th August. They first thought it was Hep A because of the jaundice, which he suffered so badly with. He went in for a whipples operation on the 15th of September but when they opened him up they realised that the tumor was bigger than any scans showed and it was wrapped around a valve in the pancreas. He was given 6 - 9 months to live. 2 weeks after he came home he was told it was fast growing and very aggressive and was then given only 5 - 6 weeks. I am so very proud of him and the way he reacted he decided not to have any treatment and just have his last few weeks at home with my mum brother and myself. Some days you forgot he had cancer he was very upbeat and positive and others he was like a shell of his former self. He lost over half his body weight and struggled to eat a thing.

I have never seen such a cruel disease. I think you always think it will happen to someone else or it is a friend of a friend and now it has happened to someone I love I feel so very vunerable.

Dad excepted what was going to happen but unfortunatley because he got so very weak he did not get to do some of the things he wanted to do before he died. They were only little things like taking the dog down to the coast with mum (where we always went on holiday) but they meant so much to him.

It got towards Christmas and he wa still here although he was only given to October. After Christmas he was detirment to make it to my birthday 3rd January. He fought with every part of his body day and night to make it he did not sleep for longer than and hour at a time. At the end it became too much for us all especially my mum as he wanted her by his side every moment. We had night nurses come in to sit with him as he was so determined to be at home. On the 2nd of januay he died at home at 7:10 in the morning he waited for the night nurse to leave and it was just him and my mum. 

I am so proud of him and my mum for how she coped. He will always be in my thoughts and my heart. Everyone says it gets easier with time and I hope they are right because the pain I feel now is unbearable. I am sure in time I will move on but my mum has to re-build her whole lif at the age of 44. My dad will never get to see my children or walk me down the aisle when I get married and I feel very cheated.

I know this is by no means an inspiration story I wish it was.

							I'm really sorry to hear about the various stories that have been posted since I was last here (in Oct '04) - I send all of you, for what it's worth of course, my absolute best wishes and positive thoughts. Knowing that I will be shadowing your experiences with the passing of loved ones makes me feel a bit weird if I'm totally honest. It scares me still, even though I've had plenty of time to ponder / get angry with / get sad about / fight / accept etc  etc

But what has gee'ed me along is the consistently warm, respectful and inspiring accounts which, for someone whose mother is still alive, can't be underestimated. It's also good to have some dialogue - even if it's infrequent - with people who understand almost exactly what's going on for you; it's very very specific, isn't it?

My Mom has been living with pancreatic cancer since the end of April last year. The combination chemo therapy I described above has 'stabilised' her which, as anyone who has come to understand this strain of cancer will know, this is the best we can hope for. There will never be a way of reversing its existence, but there are ways and means of preventing the tumour from growing at the same (aggressive) speed. And this is what the last CT scan showed: the tumour had not grown, nor had it shrunk. We were ecstatic! (And who would have thought we'd have been so happy at what would seem to be unimpressive news to the uninitiated...? Strange how life goes.)

Mom's second CT scan (with this partic chemo combo) is coming up and we're hoping we'll receive similar news. 

Some days, I find it hard to deal with. Obvious to say, I know. But when she's upbeat it's difficult to accept she's actually ill. And I freak that when my Mom's gone I'll wish I'd done this and done that - all the things I'd chosen not to do inevitably! All that fear of regret etc. Sometimes, I feel resentful; the impact it's had on my own life - arguably at that mid-30s peak - is tough. And even though I don't want my Mom to be grateful I've given up my career etc to hang out with her, (sounds better than 'care for'), I wish I didn't need quite as much reassurance that what I'm doing is a welcome / good thing. 

And I really really understand the person who last posted their story when she said she can't bear the thought of her Dad not seeing her (future) children nor being able to give her away at her wedding.... Me too, from a daughter / Mom pov. I find all that kind of stuff the hardest to take on board - there's nothing I could say to help but I hope you'll take small comfort knowing you're not alone. [Big big hug] 

I wish there were more I could do to raise awareness about the initial diagnosis of pancreatic cancer, which as we all prob know, is a feature that so fundamentally delays the treatment that people's lives are, literally, at stake. My Mom's diagnosis was initially gall stones; her back pain was so chronic she'd rock to and fro in her chair, rarely getting comfy enough to stop rocking! Awful. 

If anyone would be interested in helping to raise money for pancreatic cancer research, I'd be really keen to hear from you; I have a project I'm working on that needs (non-financial) contributions! Email: tiari@hotmail.co.uk

Warmth and good vibes to all - TT

I truly believe that any treatment has to be scientifically tested before employed. As with all herbs, supplements etc, these have not been tested and as such I would not indicate to my patients. The thought is that we don't know if that's beneficial, but we also don't know if it can be harmful.

							Leo:
I understand where you stand on this topic. But would it not be beneficial to test certain holistic remedies to validate their effectiveness, especially considering that many people are venturing into alternative therapies?

On another note:
How long has the radioactive seed implants been in use for prostate cancer? What is the typical effectiveness of this treatment, compared to other traditional sources?
						

"
"


							Breighton,

I completely agree that all these alternative medicines should have a rigorous evaluation before they are released to the market. As it stands, the FDA does not regulate any of these supplements, as they are sold as nutritional supplements, and are not considered ""medications"". So it's hard to even know what compounds are there.

Now about these seed implants: see the following excerpt from Up-to-Date about PB (prostatic brachytherapy)





			
				PB alone  PB appears to be equivalent to other treatments for men with low risk disease, but may be associated with an inferior outcome in men with higher Gleason grade or pretreatment serum PSA [83,90-94]. In the absence of randomized data, the following observational studies in which PB has been compared to EBRT and/or RP provide support for these conclusions:

   One series compared bRFS rates for men with clinical T1-2 prostate cancer treated with either PB (n = 695) or EBRT (n = 1527) [92]. EBRT was associated with significantly better five-year bRFS for men with Gleason 8 to 10 tumors (52 versus 28 percent), while the outcome for lower grade lesions was similar.

   Similar results were noted in a retrospective cohort study of 1872 men with clinically localized disease who underwent PB, EBRT, or RP [91]. There were no differences in bRFS among men with low-risk tumors (stage T1c and T2a (show table 1), serum PSA 10 ng/mL, and Gleason score 6) treated with PB, RP, or EBRT. (See ""Defining clinical outcome"" above). However, men with high-risk (stage T2c or serum PSA >20 ng/mL or Gleason score  or intermediate risk disease (stage T2b or Gleason score of 7 or serum PSA >10 ng/mL) undergoing PB with or without neoadjuvant hormone therapy did significantly worse than surgically treated men (relative risk (RR) of biochemical failure 3.0 and 3.1, respectively). Of note, the median follow-up in this trial was relatively short, compromising data interpretation.

   In a systematic overview of PB that included 13 case series and three cohort studies, the outcome following PB was comparable to RP in men with favorable risk tumors (clinical stage T1-T2, Gleason score 6, and serum PSA level <10 ng/mL) [94].


Thus, as with other treatments for clinically localized disease, the outcome of PB can be predicted based upon pretreatment variables such as serum PSA, biopsy Gleason score, and clinical stage. A nomogram to estimate the five-year outcome from PB has been developed, but not yet validated [95].

It would be beneficial to test alternative treatments for effective, but my understanding of why so little of this is done is because there is no one to sponsor the enormously expensive testing process.  Pharmaceutical companies sponsor most of the research and testing done in this country, and they only sponsor it to test products they can patent, sell, and make millions of dollars on.  Natural remedies do not fall into this category.  Cancer patients and others suffer because of this.  I do not know what the answer is, except for an increase in government spending on research to sponsor some of these trials.

You bring up a very important point. Most trials are about the newest and most promising drugs. Of course pharmaceutical companies want to get their reward for the investment, so they will only fund something that might be profitable. I am glad the NIH still has money for research, and really hope that it continues to exist. It is getting a lot harder to get grants from the NIH, though...

  we are constantly told no blood pressure on the affected side as it can possibly set off or exacerbate lymphedema.  yet i just had a mammo that has left the affected arm numb and throbbing and i started wondering if something like this can set off lymphedema in women too.  of course, there aren't too many other options, but i am wondering about what kind of damage can possibly be done  by being clamped into these machines under tremendous pressure - it seems the force is way stronger than a bp cuff.  ever hear any discussion on this?

Thanks for your post. You pose an interesting question. I am really not sure if it can exacerbate lymphedema.

							Hi!

I am a lymphedema therapist.  I have never had a mamogram, so I'm not exactly sure what it entails.  However,  it is more of a problem if there is compression to the arm or to the lymph nodes in the arm pit, than to the breast tissue.  If you would like me to send you a list of lymphedema precautions I'd be happy to do so.

							hi temma.  i am guessing since you never had a mammogram that you are fairly young.  you stand close to the machine, the breast gets put between two plexiglass type plates and then gets compressed until it's flat like a pancake while they take the pictures.  there are a few jokes out there on the internet likening it to slamming your boob in a refrigerator door or getting it run over by a truck, and while funny,  i think really that's not too far off the mark.   

you hold the position for a few seconds until the picture is taken and the machine releases you. they take both vertical and horizontal shots. usually it's a mildly unpleasant moment which is over quickly, but this last time part of my armpit was caught in the vice (intentionally), including chest muscle, etc.  it caused about a week of numbness, which is now fading. 

if you work in a medical facility, maybe you could convince a tech to do a dry run on you (without actually taking the pictures) so you could experience it and get a better idea.  i do have a list of lymphedema precautions, thankyou, but have never seen a mammo mentioned, which is why i asked.  but maybe you would want to post the precautions here for others.

							I would think that if you had a complete lymphendectomy in your axilla and your left chest wall, that there would be a chance of upsetting your lymph system when you have a mammogram. The fact is, even if you are retaining water elsewhere in your body, it would affect the lymph system, as that fluid would need places to go. But, I'm just a guessing.  
I had a mammogram recently, and I didn't have a lymphadema flare-up afterwards, even though I have no nodes under my arm or in my left chest wall, and I've had radiation. I seem to have flare-ups when I lift heavy things or otherwise stress my arm.

This is a wonderful project you have undertaken.  Many patients and patients? families will benefit from it.  It is especially encouraging that you, a professional medical doctor, intend to participate in the discussions.  


I am 65 years old and was diagnosed with prostate cancer at age 62.

Between Dec 1999 and Dec 2000 my PSA hooked up from 2.1 to 4.1 ng/ml.  In July 2001 a biopsy showed cancer of the prostate (Gleason 3+4=7).  I finished 7800 Gy 3-D External Beam Radiation Treatment in April 2002.  PSA had leveled off to about 0.5 until May 2004 when it rose to 1.0.  In August 2004 PSA had risen to 2.1.  Another biopsy showed recurrence of cancer. (Gleason 3+5=8).  

After a series of scans (Prostascint, Abdominal/Pelvic Scan, Full Body Bone Scan) my Urologist suggested ?salvage surgery? to remove the prostate gland.  Presumably the scans showed that the cancer is still contained in the prostate gland has not metastasized.  He also put me on hormones (CASODEX pills and LUPRON shot).

Question:
Is surgery really a viable option after failure of external beam radiation treatment and if so, what can I expect?  What are the statistics for such surgery and how much more traumatic is it to the patient than ?normal? prostate removal surgery?    What institutions specialize in this procedure?      Thanks, Werner

				Asymptomatic prostate-specific antigen (PSA) recurrence after radiation therapy for prostate carcinoma poses a diagnostic and therapeutic dilemma for clinicians. Patients with locally recurrent disease can consider treatment options of salvage surgery, cryotherapy, watchful waiting, or androgen deprivation. Of these options, only salvage surgery has been shown to result in long-term disease-free survival for selected patients. However, salvage surgery is associated with significant morbidity, including urinary incontinence and rectal injuries. Ideally, salvage surgery outcomes can be optimized with careful patient selection according to clinical stage, serum PSA levels before radiation and surgery, the medical condition of the patient, and clear expectations of the physician and patient. Among patients with locally recurrent disease, those with localized prostate carcinoma amenable to radical prostatectomy before radiation or cryotherapy would be the most suitable candidates for salvage surgery.
			
		

And here's the conclusion of the article:




			
				With vigilant PSA screening, recurrent disease after definitive local therapy for prostate cancer is commonly an asymptomatic increasing PSA level rather than clinically palpable disease. A growing subset of young healthy patients who were good candidates for primary prostatectomy will present for salvage therapy after radiation therapy with PSA-only recurrence. Careful patient selection and discussion of treatment options with suitable candidates can identify patients who would most benefit from salvage surgery. Compared with early reports of salvage surgery, contemporary salvage prostatectomy series have demonstrated excellent local control, good long-term disease-free survival, and acceptable complication rates and health-related quality of life. We believe that early identification and treatment of recurrent disease results in lower stage at diagnosis (optimally, clinical T1c disease), better biochemical and disease-free survival, and lower complication rates after salvage surgery.
			
		

And here's the full reference with a link
1) Salvage prostatectomy in patients who have failed radiation therapy or cryotherapy as primary treatment for prostate cancer Urology, Volume 62, Supplement 1, 29 December 2003, Pages 69-78 Bert T. Chen and David P. Wood, Jr
http://www.sciencedirect.com/science...e4bd7644d88007

Essentially this option appears to be of benefit only to selected candidates, who are otherwise in good health and are young. I think the ideal situation would be to discuss in more detail with your doctor. The big problem with having surgery in an area that has been irradiated is that the tissues become stiff and the surgery is much more technically difficult, and the complications are more frequent.

Thank you for your response with useful information as well as some mild advice. 

I have an appointment at Mayo Clinic next Monday (18 Oct 2004) with a surgeon who has removed ?many? cancerous prostate glands after external beam radiation treatment has failed.  This, according to a Urology Triage Nurse I spoke with by phone.

I realize that eligibility for surgery after external beam radiation has failed is very patient-specific and I may not qualify.  The surgeon will make that decision based on my history, past test results, recent test results, additional test results and my input during the initial interview.

As things progress in my situation I will post again ? but it might be a couple of weeks.

The procedure is called ""orchiectomy.""

If Corey Googles that word, he'll find a number of websites, including a couple for transexuals.

One of the more helpful is http://my.webmd.com/hw/prostate_cancer/hw77950.asp

Another method of castration, not involving surgery, is ""chemical castration."" Drugs used are, for example, Zoladex and Lupron. However, in the case of the drugs and where the condition treated is prostate cancer, they may become ineffective as against cancer cells over time.

Side effects are the same for either procedure. They include hot flashes, eventual loss of bone mass if not medicated, possible weight gain, possible breast growth (gynecomastia). But every man is different; YMMV.

							A better form to take laetrile

Laetrile, also named as amygdalin or vitamine B17, belongs to the category of alternative cancer drugs, which as other like galavit, noni etc, are rather controversely discussed, and the reports about wonderful results as well as criticism of this apricot extract will not stop. Its of no doubt that some unserious businessmakers with products of apricot seeds, not always duplicated how these was extracted and sold to impertinent prices, damaged the reputation of laetrile in the cancer  therapy. However, taken responsible and serious, the effectivity of laetrile in a cancer  therapy remains very probable, and side efffects can be avoided. 

It should also be mentioned, that pure dried bitter apricot seeds with a high amount of amygdalin can be purchased to a very reasonable price because all the middlemen are eliminated and the pure amygdalin remains in the seeds, without being extracted. His effiency however therefore is rather increased than decreased, because in the seeds is the whole natural complex of action. The seeds should be taken together with frsh or dried papayas or fresh or dried ananas, because the containing enzymes are components of the mechanism of action.

Sometimes the simple solution is the better solution. For further free informations about apricot seeds and other natural cancer drugs  mail to me, Dr. Alexander Schrenk, mail: AlexanderSchrenk@lycos.de

I, too, have been recently diagnosed with intraductal and invasive adenocarcinoma, with a 2cm tumor, found in the breast tissue surrounding the tumor and in the sentinel node and one other node.  I was told by my surgeon that I was a stage 2.  I had sentinel node biopsy and a partial mastectomy on 9/29, but have not yet seen the oncologists.
I've been looking for more information on being her2 neg, and er/pr neg, and this is the only thread I've found so far.

""Physicians often examine hormone receptors in breast cancer cells at the time of biopsy or breast surgery to determine whether estrogen receptors (ER-positive) or progesterone receptors (PR-positive) are present. Patients whose cancers have ER or PR-positive receptors tend to have a better prognosis than patients whose cancers do not have these receptors. Cancers with ER or PR-positive receptors are also much more likely to respond to chemotherapy or hormone treatment.""

I sure wish this wasn't so scary.  I can feel myself take a nose dive mentally when I read stuff like this.  I've been watching this thread and hoping that someone posts something hopeful here.  Somewhere, someone had posted about it being a good thing to be er/pr neg.    

In addition to all this, while I was recovering from my surgery, my boss replaced me.  I was working as a temp-to-perm and although she initially told me she would work with me and around my schedule, she evidently changed her mind.  She told me she needs someone to be there 40 hours a week, and I simply can not be there 40 hours a week right now.  I haven't even STARTED my treatment let alone healed from my surgery.

What I have researched so far is that er-/pr-  responds to chemo better than er+/pr+.  There is a thread on breastcancer.org which I found and moved closer to the top.

Good luck  to you.

I'm going for my second onc appt. this Thurs. where I need to talk more about chemo and then I'll decide what to do.  I am against chemo because of the other medical problems I have and chemo is only going to make them worse, if there is a worse.

							Hi Andee,
With you being er - and Grade 3, I'd be really surprised if they didn't do chemo.  Have you considered a mastectomy vs. a lumpectomy?  That way if there are any stray cells in the breast tissue, the mastectomy would get rid of them.  I opted for a masectomy (age 43) and then had the other breast removed last May.  I had Lobular which is more prone to mirror itself in the other breast, but for me, it wasn't worth not having the mastectomy for the reason I said in the beginning.  I realize you are the only one that can make the right decision for you, but wanted to bring it up about stray cells.
I've known alot of ladies with diabetes and oe that has a pacemaker that went through chemo.  I don't know what your other medical problems are and I'm not trying to pry.  They do an echo or muga scan before chemo to check the heart valves.  There are some chemos that have less side affects the others.  I would definately not rule out chemo as it's the best thing we have going for us right now.  Also because you can't take Tamoxefin or Arimidex or one of those since you're er/pr- I'm sure the onco will want to treat aggressively, but also carefully and will look at your other health issues.  
Some handle chemo better then others.  I never threw up, but had nausea and my biggest thing was fatigue and some neuropathy, but there is meds for that if needed.  They have more nausea meds now then even when I was going through it, about 2 1/2 years ago.
This is scary no matter how you look at it and I get nervous before my check ups even though it's been 2 1/2 years and I'm sure I always will,  but we have to do everything possible to stop this beast from coming back.
If you still have concerns about chemo and your health problems, you can always get a 2nd opinon.  If you have heart problems, just as an example, your cardiologist will be consulted and he'll get a copy of all the reports.  You will be in the hands of many who are they to help you.
Take care and keep us posted

							Nancy,

All my doctors are pushing chemo.  They knew at the beginning that I was against chemo.  You're not prying.  7 years ago, I was diagnosed with interstitial cystitis, an incurable bladder disease that won't kill me, it justs make my life miserable all the  time and I spend more time in the bathrom then anywhere else.  A  couple of months later, I was diagnosed with peripheral neuropathies and muscle weakness in my arms, hands, legs, feet and back which has made me almost bed ridden.

My onc recommended chemo of MLF (Methotrexate, Leucovorin and 5-FU).  This chemo regimen is twice a month for six months.  I can't have Cytoxan or anything similar because it would cause my bladder to bleed and make my interstitial cystitis worse than it is already.  I am also afraid of more extreme neuropathies and muscle weakness than I already have.  My urologist and oncologist said we'll deal with it, but I am allergic to so many drugs that they both know that will be difficult to do.  I do know what my chances are if I don't  do chemo.  I already had a lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy and the 3 nodes were clean and the tumor margins were clean.  I just had a Bone Scan and CAT Scans and they were clean.  I'm starting Mammosite Radiation (Brachytherapy) starting the end of next week.  Then I'll decide whether I have chemo or not.  Most women fight this as hard as they can.  I feel I have to do what I feel is good  for me.

Congratulations on being  2-1/2 years NED.

That's true and it's because er-/pr- breast cancer is usually more aggressive then er+/pr+, meaning the cells are dividing more rapidly. Chemo is most effective on cancers that are rapidily dividing. The more rapidly dividing the cells are, the better chemo works for it. It's not that chemo doesn't help less aggressive cancers...just that it's the most effective on the more aggressive ones.  Many of the side effects from chemo are the result of it's effect on the bodys normal cells that are also rapidly dividing. The GI tract from the mouth all the way to the anus,  the hair, fingernails, and bone marrow etc, all contain rapidly dividing cells.

   The Methotrexate is not used in colorectal cancer.  but the 5-FU/Leucovorin is used either by itself or with one or two of five other agents (oxaliplatin/irinotecan/avastin/erbitux/one other can't remember).  Like breast cancer, xeloda (pill form of 5-fu that does not need leucovorin) is used as an alternative to 5-fu.  Hair loss is not a common side effect of 5-fu, but gi problems are, whether it be diarrhea or constipation.  Hand/Foot syndrome, nausea, and blood count problems are also common.  Personally, I have had all of these - but at the same time, I know several people who have had none.
    Like anything else, you need to do everything that you can to keep up the strength, which translated means to eat and drink, which translated means that if nausea becomes a problem, get the medications necessary to alleviate it.  Sometimes finding the right one takes several tries.

							Hello

There is really a lot being researched on the role of COX-2 inhibitors. I can tell you that the results show some promise, but we can not make assumptions based on a phase II trial. What we need is a phase III, double-blind, placebo-controlled, randomized trial that compares patients taking COX-2 versus patients taking placebo. So at this point in time this can not be regarded as standard of care therapy.

My best advice (as a Pastor) is to have a long talk with God, and if you feel like yelling at God, go right ahead. Even if you don't believe He exists. As well, call a friend you can trust and lean on them. This is a time when you will need support. Even if it is difficult to reach out, it is far far more difficult to go it alone.

Thanks for sharing your story with us. I hope we can help in some way. One of the advices I would give is to not suffer by anticipation. I admit that not knowing what to expect is the worst, but you have a plan, you will see the doctors and they will evaluate and treat you appropriately. So try to do some things you enjoy, go shopping, to the movies, something. I would encourage you to ask things here, not only I am here but there a several extremely supportive men and women here. 

Just a detail, a core biopsy is not able to define size of the tumor to stage it. The 8 mm you have seen is the size of the biopsy itself. Size of the tumor is defined when there is a surgical specimen, i.e. from a mastectomy or from a lumpectomy.

							Hi Sharon, this is really the pits, isn't it? Well, hang in there. Life is going to get better eventually. You've gotten good advice from the others. I was diagnosed in 1996 with a 6 mm tumor following excisional biospy. I did radiation (no chemo -- lymph nodes were neg.) and five years of tamoxifen. It all started 8 1/2 years ago, my dear. And, I am doing just fine. If you can take DH or another person with you to the onc.'s or surg. when you discuss treatment it helps. Or, tape record the conversation.

							Hi Sharon and everyone else,

Boy, can I relate to you Sharon!  I (thanks to this Forum) am beginning to retain some of this overwhelming information.  All I knew until yesterday was that I had cancer in my breast ducts, and that according to my tests that were done prior to my surgery, my tumor was 6 x 8 mm with a smaller tumor immediately adjascent to that one according to the tests that were done prior to my surgery.  The plan was to do a lumpectomy and sentinel node surgery, however, because the sentinel node was positive, my surgeon (this was discussed beforehand) removed the tumor, the breast tissue around the tumor (to get clear margins) and 18 other lymph nodes were removed as well.

The one thing that I have learned in a relatively short period of time because of all the sharing here, is that each cancer is unique, each person is unique, therefore, each treatment is unique.  Fortunately, I have my faith to carry me through this, because the process of this news can be crippling emotionally, and I know that He will see me through this.

Since my surgeon was on vacation when my head finally began to clear enough for me to begin taking some of this information in, I felt totally lost as I read what people wrote here.  I didn't even know my medical diagnosis!  There was all these foreign medical abbreviations and different kinds of treatments and negative and positive phrases and UGH..  I couldn't even call the office to ask questions, because I didn't even know what to ask!  After I posted here, a very reassuring lady from this forum (THANK YOU BARBARA!) called me and gave me permission to incessantly ramble and ask all my ""dumb questions"".  After talking with her, I felt like I had enough information to know what to ask my surgeon's nurse.  I finally mustered up the courage to call and ask her to read my pathology report to me and explain what she could.  I read off some notes, abbreviations, etc to her that I didn't know what they meant (abbreviations, etc that I've seen here) and although many can only be answered my my radiation oncologist or my medical oncologist, here's what I learned:
I have ""intraductal and invasive adenocarcinoma.  The tumor was 2 cm.  The cancer had spread to my lymph nodes and was found in the breast tissue around my tumor.  I am HER2 negative.  I am ER/PR negative.  As for the lymph nodes, the sentinel node was removed and out of 18 other nodes removed, only 1 had ""one tiny millimeter"" of cancer.

So.. now I am in desperate need of some feedback from you ladies and Dr. Leo about all this!

Thank you and God bless each and everyone one of you!!

Thanks for posting. I am sorry to hear about your husband. Squamous cell carcinoma is the histologic diagnosis, what they see under the microscope. For example, a breast cancer is often adenocarcinoma, so adenocarcinoma is what they see under the microscope.

							Hello

Thanks for sharing your experience. I am sorry about your father. Predicting survival is not only difficult, but it will probably create unrealistic expectations, so most doctors opt to not give numbers, as it's likely to be wrong. I think if he has opted for hospice, the best he and the family can do is to try to get the most of the time he has left. Hospice usually does a very good job at making people comfortable and trying to relieve the symptoms as best as they can.

i had endometrial cancer (stage 2) in 1990 and have been cancer free since then.  at that time  i was offered some kind of chemo afterwards and refused it
because i was told that my chances of survival were 50-50 whether i did
chemo or not........

i recently went to a new gyn..(my old one had died)...and because i had
previously had cancer,  she ordered a cat scan...evidently her normal procedure.    A few hot spots showed up,  among them a suspicious tumor
in my lung....and 2 small suspicious tumors in pelvic soft tissue..(i think
soft tissue---certainly not bone)...

i then had a pet scan w. the same results.  i then had a lung needle biopsy
---yeow!!! that really hurt something FIERCE!!!   now i have to get
pelvis needle biopsys next week and i SO DREAD  going through the same
pain again.  god!

my question for the moment is:  why cant they knock me out?  like when
you get a colonoscopy?   the doc's all say,  ""oh,  it doesn't hurt that much
....""   right it doesnt hurt THEM.

all i got for the lung thing was a little swipe of lidocaine on the surface...
but the pain was excruciating on the INSIDE.   can i get the docs to give me something for the next round of tests...  or take something by mouth
beforehand????   if yes....like what?

also.....
i do understand the potential--if it's only the lung,  then they will operate,
period, finished,  the end.  (bad joke)    but if the ""adenacarcinoma""  has
metasticized,  what am i probably facing in terms of treatment?

thank you.  i look forward to your kind, but realistic answer.

							Hi

Thanks for your post. One thing that I've said before is: no one has to feel pain. There are so many medications and anesthetics available, that I can't understand what the deal is to give local anesthesia. Doing sedation is sometimes more complicated, if you're healthy that's fine, but if you have multiple other problems it could cause problems with breathing or even heart issues.

Anyway, you can always ask for sedation and more pain relief. Explain your experience with the lung biopsy. 

I hope all goes well.

							Hello Dr. Leo,

I'm not even really sure what question I want to ask, as we don't have very much information at this time.  My older sister (dx at 41, now 42) had a lumpectomy, then simple mastectomy almost a year ago today (dx: extensive dcis, unclear margins).  

This past weekend, she found a lump under her arm on the mastectomy side.  Ultrasound showed a cyst, oncologist was concerned, called it a 'complex' cyst, and aspirated on the spot.  Initial report back today, shows malignant cells present.  We're overwhelmed ... and wondering how this could have happened, when her cancer was ""contained"".  Did they miss some of it?

Not sure what her treatment will be at this point, but wanted to know if you think they would treat this as another primary cancer or a metastasis?  Also, how can a cancer spread when she had a clear sentinel node and they took the breast off?  

As I said, not even sure what other questions I have.  Just regretting I'm here to begin with.  

I appreciate your time and the service you're offering to those who need it.

Thank you.

							Hello, and thanks for posting.

Unfortunately, sentinel lymphnode is a very good technique, but in Medicine there is no technique that is 100% certain. So there are cases that even when the sentinel lymphnode is negative, there may be positve axillary nodes. I am afraid this may have happened with your sister, but I can not be sure. So at this point this may be considered recurrent breast cancer to the axillary lymphnodes. She will probably have another staging evaluation, and be treated appropriately.

I hope she does well. There are several approaches that may be taken, and it looks like she has a really good doctor.

							ROFL     I'm not blonde and I have alot of DUH moments.

The grade is how aggressive the cancer cells are.  Grade 1 is slow growing, I was Grade 2 (of course I have to be different) which is not the slowest, but not the fastest, and Grade 3 is the fastest growing cells.  Most ladies I know are grade 3.  I don't know if that's more common or just the ones that I've gotten to know.  From what I understand and thank God we have Leo to correct me if I'm wrong.  Chemo responds better to faster growing cells, so if you are a grade 2 or 3, it will respond generally to those, BUT like everything else with this disease, everyone regardless of their grade could respond the opposite.  Grade 1 may still respond well to chemo and some Grade 3's don't.  It's a crap shot, but I'm betting on the winning side

							Hello

When we talk about histological grade is how well differentiated a group of cancer cells look under the microscope. Differentiation referers to the degree of how a cell looks like it should....maybe a better definition is exemplifying.:

a well differentiated cell: a cell that has features that are more similar to the tissue it came from. The less differentiated, the more aggressive the cell is, but not necessarily clinically aggressive.

I just found this reference for you to take a look at. They explain a bit better than me

							Hi Leo,
That link has me wondering something.  It's showing what the 5 year survival rate is, not sure if it means survival without a reoccurence or survival period.  It's showing after 5 years the survival rate goes down.  I thought the longer out without a reoccurence the better chance not to have one, but that link says differently.

Next question.... lol  Not sure if i want the answer though..  When it comes to er/pr+......is it better to be 80% er/pr+ as far as prognosis and using Arimidex, Tamoxifen or whatever or is it a better prognosis if your er/pr + is 30%?

Don't you love my questions.... lol
Thanks
Nancy

							Hi Nancy, 

I will share with you what I was told (until Dr. Leo gets here).

I was told that the higher your ER and PR are, the better.  Mine is ER 70 and PR 60 and I was told that is a very favorable prognostic indicator.  I've seen some gals have 98 or 99 percent!  This means the response from the hormonal therapy would be way up there.   But they also say that even if one is only a few percent positive that there is still some benefit, just not as much.

I know what you mean about the survival charts.  My docs told me that most recur within five years (about 80 percent) and that the rest would recur (IF they are going to recur) anytime during the rest of your life.  But most charts do show drops after five years all the way to ten years.  It doesn't make sense to me either.

Hope this helps a little!  Have a great day.

Hugs,

							I was just diagnosed with EC (esophageal cancer) and I'm still waiting for my CT scan to find out the specifics of stage and placement. I'm 26 years old, smoked for about 3-4 years but quite 5 years ago. I have a 4 year old son and my wife is in her last trimester, I want to have as much information as possible before telling her about the diagnosis. I was also hoping to find a support group of some kind for us, but especially for her. If anyone has been through this, or has any information that might be helpful it would be greatly appreciated. I know many of the basic dry facts, but would like to hear from someone who knows first hand what I may be facing. Again thank you.

							Hi Shaggy,

I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer and breast cancer in May of this lousy year.  What I can tell you is that I have been very lucky in that chemo and radiation worked enough for me to be able to gain some of the 50 lbs. that I had lost before diagnosis.  On October 6th, I had an esophagectomy and partial mastectomy.  My recuperation has been pretty good, I am told but this is a very hard cancer.  I was told that all of the cancer had been eradicated by the chemo/radiation and that there was no trace of malignancy or metatasis.  I was lucky with that, not the breast but that is a different story.

My recovery has been very slow as far as I am concerned.  My weight continues to be a problem in that I cannot seem to be able to gain much at all and if I do, one bad day and that is gone.  The chemo did not cause me to be sick at all, just very fatigued and out of sorts for a couple of days and radiation just caused fatigue.

In my case, my father had the same cancer and died as a result of it.  I am told that it is not familial but I beg to differ with someone!  The breast cancer is hereditary and from my fathers side of the family.  

I hope that you have begun treatment and are doing well and that your wife will have a safe delivery.  I am the mother of a 15 year old adopted son who is the light of my life, what I can tell you is that I am a fighter because of him and my husband and that is what gets me through the bad days.  Next week I will begin Chemo for the breast cancer and one more time, I will fight for them and myself.  I need to get my life back, get back to work and being a mom.  that is my job right now and it should be what you focus on.

Right now, my family and are getting ready to kick 2004 out of the door and welcome 2005 with pleasure.

Happy New Year

							First of all, thanks for what looks like a Board that is going to be very productive and informative since it is mainly for people undergoing like but unlike cancer situations.

And YES, we are keeping a fair sense of humor in our household, as much as we can.  Some of the situations we have gone through have been horrifying and some have (after they are over and done with) been funny.  Anyone helping a cancer patient can understand what I mean, sometimes you laugh so that you don't cry, e.g he bought a 2004 HD Road-King Custom 6/13/04 and was diagnosed with the latest 8/2/04, so we call it our expensive garage decoration until we can sell it.

I hope someone can understand the following in reference to Palliative Care.  I am almost at my wits end.  I would like your opinion on Medical Oncologist and Radiation Oncologist's Palliative care.  husband curently 64 years old.  Brief med history: 9/93 Invas Malignant Melanoma - Right  Posterier Calf/Ankle, Wide Radical excision, split thickness skin graft.  Various Other Minor Resections of Skin Lesions; 6/02 Invasive Adenocarcinoma - Low Anterior Resection - between Stage I & II, closer to Stage I, no adjuntive treatment; 2/03 Lung Nodules - healed 9/03 Right Superficial Paritodectomy - Sjogren's Syndrome; 3/04 Spermatocele; 3/03 thru 4/04 Granulomatous Disease Clacified pleural plaque suggesting prior Asbestos exposure;.....  All of these previous cancers and medical problems we have been given the straight scoop on what to expect, e.g. life expectency, medical reactions, etc.
8/2/04 diagnosed w/Osseous Metastasis involving the S2 Sacrum (which is entirely eaten away and the tumor extends and has what looks like feelers on it) w/extraosseous extension (cat scan needle biospy under IV sedation shows a poorly differentiated adenocarcinoma consistent with a a colon primary).  Has had 45 Gray radiation, they were looking to give 51 Gray as the max is 61 Gray for his condition but he stopped because he was having an extensive amount of pain after the first Chemo.  Prior to this he had been put on 240mg ms-contin, some through a drip.  He now since completing the radiation has himself on 30mg ms-contin twice daily.  Trying to cut himself down to 15mg twice daily due to nausea (25mg Benedryl helps with this).  He received 5-FU (725mg) and Calcium Leucovorin through his Port-A-Cath (which they thought might enhance his radiation treatments) gave him a ""Cerebellor Syndrome"" reaction.  He is allergic to Reglan, Phenagran, Haldol, Compazine (""Lockjaw"" type reaction), Percocet, Steroids, Nerve Medications.  Sensitive to Benedryl but can be given to him in 1/2 doses.  He became psychotic (3 distinct personalities) on a combination of 200mg Ms-Contin 2x daily, 4mg Decadron 4x daily, 0.25mg Xanax 4x daily.  I just am wondering why when he asks for a prognosis they tell him that they do not have a crystal ball and start tap dancing around his questions.  My daughter has been a legal assistant for medical malpractice attorneys for over 10 years (yeah I don't care much for them either...lol) but daughters and I do know the score and the doctors keep looking at me while they are fielding his questions and giving him the runaround.  Can you make any sense of this.....   Today he started his round of Chemo Therapy.  I will be once a week for 6 months, he has been cut down to 300mg 5-FU, Calcium Leucovorin which was started out with Zofran due to his previous reaction, with the initial thoughts that they may add Oxaliplatin; the FOLFOX regimen.  Thank You for any explanation of this type of care that you can afford me.

First of all, thanks for posting. It seems like your family and husband have been through a lot already. I understand that he has already several issues related to pain due to his metastatic colon cancer to the sacral area. 

I am not sure what you're asking me, but if it's related to prognosis, most physicians like myself do not give numbers since prognosis is so unpredictable. He has had some chemotherapy, and is getting another one, so there is some chance to buy more time. But the problems associated with chemotherapy are usually infections, bleeding, skin and hair changes, kidney complications, etc. 

What I can tell you is that he is being followed pretty closely by his doctors, and I guess the best way to face it is to take issues as they arise. I would also make plans thinking that he may have a problem that may be fatal at any time, so that you are ready for things as they happen. Talk to him extensively about what he wishes if things go bad: things like CPR, intubation, prolonged life support, etc. Having these issues settled makes things a lot easier for the family if already discussed with the patient.

							Hi everyone. My wife just received the pathology report from her lumpectomy. They were to perform a SNB also, but it didn't work, so we don't know about any lymph node involvement. My wife really doesn't want to do an aux node section either.

She has IDC (Grade 1), 10mm, surgical margins are negative, ER/PR positive.

Anyway here are my concerns from the report....

1) ""There is a focus of lymphatic vessel invasion at the periphery of the tumor""

2) ""Focus of vascular invasion identified""

3) ""There is also a focus of peineural invasion""

4) ""A small focus of atypical lobular hyperplasia present less than 1mm from the medial margin""

I've done some quick research, and found that lymphatic or vascular invasion is a pretty good indicator of metastasis elsewhere such as this quote from a medical website:

""This often results in implantation of tumor emboli in adjacent tissues and indicates that distant metastases are likely."" 

Can someone please help me understand this better?
						

"
"


							HI,
I can't answer all your concerns, but I can tell you this. I had a 5.5cm tumor and 9 positive lymph nodes out of 16.  They did a CT Scan, bone scan, chest x-ray and tons of lab work before I started chemo and I had NO distant mets.  Just because you had node involvement does not mean that it has spread to organs or your bone.  I know 3 ladies, one like me had 9+ nodes, one had 15+ nodes and 1 had 11+ nodes and none had distant mets.  I'm 2 years and 8 months NED (No evidence of disease) and the other ladies are 4 yeras out and 6 years out.  YOu always hope you don't have node involvement, but it doesn't mean it's gone to organs.  I've seen ladies with tiny tumors and no node involvement and they have had reoccurences to the liver or bones.  There is no rhyme or reason to this disease, I guess that's where there is no cure.

Things may have changed since I was dx, but my surgeon said that they check several blood vessels during my mastectomy and found no cancer cells in them BUT that didn't mean it hadn't gone into my blood stream from the nodes.  Again, unless things have changed, there is no test to know for sure.  Obviously if they found vascular invasion then it is in the blood stream, but either way, the treatment would be the same.  Chemo and radiation.  I had 6 rounds of Cytoxin, Epriubensin (sp) and 5FU and then 33 or 36 treatments of radiation (Thank God I'm starting to forget some of this nightmare).

I'd sit down with the surgeon and/or oncologist and ask them to explain the parts you don't understand.  This is a very emotional time and I always had someone go with me because my brain shut down after hearing just so much.

Your wife will get in the ""kick cancer butt"" mode, like we all do and she'll get through all the treatments fine.  It sucks, but she can do it.  I know this is hard on you also, so don't hesistate to ask questions.  Most don't ramble like me.. LOL

							Hi Riesesdad - I had a 2 cm stage 2, grade 2 invasive ductal cancer with associated DCIS.ER+.   Had lumpectomy and 8 sample nodes removed - they didn't do SNB in UK then, 2003.  2 of the 8 nodes were cancerous, so I went back for total axillary clearance. Another 1 found to be cancerous, so 3/18. All bc tumours over 1 cm in the UK are treated with chemo, if patient agrees, and to my utter disbelief, some don't. I had a CT scan, bone scan, and chest x-ray after the surgeries, and no evidence of metastases was found.
So having some nodes positive does not necessarily mean the cancer has spread. I am now NED and thankful to be alive. The treatment is tough, but doable, especially with such a caring partner as yourself.
Hope all goes well for you both.
Liz.

							Hello

Lymphatic and vascular invasion is a sign that the tumor is locally invasive. Atypical lobular hyperplasia was also seen close to the surgical margins. I think you should wait for the sentinel lymphnode results, but your doctor will have to weigh the risks and benefits of additional treatment, but probably your wife will need more treatment: more surgery, radiation ,chemotherapy, or a combination of these.

Leo

							My surgeon tried a SNB was unsuccessful, as was the other tracing tests they did. This is quite unusual for them to be unable to trace via the sentinel route, but does happen. As a result of the unsuccessful SNB, my surgeon removed 14 lymph nodes, and 2 of them were positive for cancer. He said they looked normal to the naked eye, but path results showed grade 1 DC 1cm tumor, clear margins er pr + heu -, and it was all done during the same surgery.  I am very thankful he took this route. I would recommed that your wife either have the node disection or take the full course of chemo, with the assumption that she would have pos. nodes. You cannot be too cautious with this disease, and unfortunately, as someone else said, there is no rhyme or reason for mets, lymph node involvement, recurrence etc, so treat it as aggressively as you can tolerate. And positive nodes are not a death sentence, thank God.  Good luck.

							Rachel - Did you mean that your primary tumor was Grade 1, 1cm, clear margins er/pr + .

							Hi, I've just joined this because I need to speak to people that have /been there..
I just had a look at my husbands hospital letter and as far as I knew everything was ok, as ok as t can be when you've been diagnosed with cancer.
He was diagnosed last year with follicular variant of papillary cancer and he had a total thyroidectomy.It was stage one and they said he would be ok and it didn't spread and that this was one of the types off cancer that often does not reoccur.
I try to be positive but doctors are so vague and hospital appontments are months and months apart.
Apparently its is avariant of papillary cancer and on the letter it says vascular invasion. What does that mean? What can we expect next? Does that mean it's not stage one ar that there is another cancer somwhere else that the scan did not pick up?
Not sure if the scan only followed the radioiodine or it scanned for any cancerous cells not necessary related to thyroid.
When someone is diagnosed with cancer, do doctors look for any other signs in the rest of the body.
Many questions but don't know who to ask...

							Good afternoon.  My mother has lung cancer, which spread to her brain, but she has had the right cerebellar tumor removed.  The pathology report from the tumor removed from the brain was positive for cytokeratin 7 and focally positive for TTF-1 and cytokeratin 20.  Does anyone know what this means in laymen terms?  She had a PET scan done just two days ago and we were informed today that her lymphatic system has indeed been infected....we were told she's a stage 3-b.  We were informed that she'll need whole brain radiation and then radiation/chemo for her lung/chest.  

No one has discussed prognosis and timetables yet...which is what I'm most inquisitive about.  I don't want to bring this up in front of my mother, as I don't want her to grow discouraged and simply give up.  Can anyone shed some light for me?  Many thanks in advance.

							Hi Eddie,

Gee, I'm sorry no one has responded to your post yet.  And I'm so sorry about your mom.  I can't really help you with most of your questions.  But I can shed a little light on the Taxol.

I did chemo, but not Taxol.  However, my elderly neighbor (73 years) did 6 rounds of Taxol and she tolerated it pretty well.  It is supposed to be one of the ""gentler"" chemos.  That is what I've been told by people who have had it.  Those information sheets they give you can be a bit misleading.  When my chemo nurse went over it with me, he said that they sound worse than they really are and that most people don't get many of the side effects listed.  So don't let that scare you too much.  My neighbor said the worst part of the Taxol was bone pain.  This can be alleviated somewhat by Ibuprofen or something stronger from the doctor.
Also, there is total hair loss.

My prayers are with you and your mom.  Sorry I couldn't be of more help.

Leo, if you don't mind, I wanted to follow up on one point you made.  You said, ""One thing with platinum-based therapies is that it has a very high emetogenic potential, meaning nausea and vomiting may be really big problems.""

Indeed, she has vomitted all food and liquid since last evening (it's been a little over 24 hours now).  She said she has no nausea when she hasn't consumed food, but once she does it, that she is nauseous.  I'll definitely be contacting the doctor tomorrow morning concerning this, but I was wondering if you had any advice in terms of foods/liquids that she might be able to tolerate.  The doctor had prescribed her an anti-nausea medication, but it obviously hasn't been working.

							Hi Eddie,

Just until Dr. Leo gets here, here is a little information:  www.chemocare.com is a terrific informational site.  You can click on chemo and your diet.  It also gives lots of information about the different chemos.  

I was on Adriamycin/Cytoxin with a likelihood of vomiting and nausea.  I took 2 Kytril a day for the first 3 days.  I also took compazine EVERY 4 hours for the first 5 days, at least.  I took the compazine on schedule whether I felt like I needed it or not, even setting the clock during the night.  In spite of all this, I still had some vomiting/nausea but nothing severe.  If her medications aren't working, she definitely needs to try something else.  

Anyway, please try that site.  It has so much information.

I  hope your mom gets some relief soon.

No problem at all. The only general advice is to try to keep hydrated with small sips of fluid if possible. Also, avoid anything with caffeine, chocolate, spicy etc. She definitely needs to see the doctor soon to get a better regimen. This is not uncommon to happen, and there are options for better antiemetic regimens.

							I have been diagnosed with non-invasive DCIS.  I am thankful that I found it, .6 cm.  However, I have many questions. The plan is another sugery to get the margins and radiation. Should I look to find an oncologist? What questions should I ask the radiologist? Will there be tests to make sure that there is no other cancer in my body?  Thank you in advance for your help.

							Hi Ann,
I had extensive DCIS along with invasive ductal carcinoma (full blown cancer) and I had a mastectomy.  Now a recent MRI suggests that I have DCIS in the other breast.  You're lucky that you have just DCIS because that means you won't be prescribed chemo.  Basically, DCIS is a pre-cancer, not cancer, but since it sometimes turns into cancer it is always taken out.  I'm hoping I have just DCIS, because with my first breast, thats what they thought it was but the biopsy turned up invasive cells.  Have you had a biopsy yet?

							Hi Ann,

I think it's a good idea for you to see a medical ongologist.  Your surgeon's office should be able to set this up for you.  Bring a list of questions with you.  It's also a good idea to bring a person you trust with you to the appointment as it provides an extra set of ears.  There is  a LOT of information to assimilate.

I was diagnosed with invasive ductal and the only tests ordered for me  were blood work, chest x-ray and bone scan.  If yours if non-invasive I don't know it they would order a bone scan.  Maybe Dr. Leo could answer that for you.

Sorry you have BC, but that's really good news that it's found early, small and contained.

An excellent book:  ""Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book""  If you don't want to buy it, the library should have a copy.  She answers just about every question you could think of.

Good luck and take care.

Hugs,

							Thank you for talking with me a bit on this. I have had the tumor itself removed. We just need to go back in to extend the margin area.  I do hope that all goes well for you two (Margie and Tracey). As you well know, it's the NOT KNOWING what comes next or if everything is as the Dr. says, that causes the emotional upheaval.

							Hello !

Well, as you know ductal carcinoma is situ means really a very localized cancer. The treatment is controversial, but most people opt for breast conserving treatment. Adjuvant radiation is a hot topic, and individual oncologists have differing opinions, and a very individualized approach should be taken. One opinion is that if clear margins > 10 mm are obtained RT should be optional, but again, that is one opinion in the literature.

If there are no other breast lesions, staging may be unnecessary, since it is such a localized tumor, but your doctor might want to do it.

Good luck !

							The reference that implies that dcis is not cancer is not correct.  While some resources will still say ""pre-cancer"", it is widely recognized that dcis is cancer.  It is not invasive, but, nonetheless, it is cancer.  There is little known about dcis.  But, my comedo subtype, high nuc grade 3, with extensive necrosis, 2.5 cm in size, was cancer.  Not pre.  The reference as pre just bothers me.  It somehow belittles or makes a person with dcis feel like they should not be concerned.  I just am offended by that.

Thank You for saying what I am thinking. When I had DCIS, I asked the surgeon why I wasn't getting tamoxafin, and she said ""oh you aren't even a candidate for that--I don't know why you are so worried, your cancer was so early, it almost is not a cancer""
She never explained further.
My dcis was aggresive, comedo hi grade 1 cm. I had a lumpectomy and 25 rads treatments.
It is now 5 yrs 9 months later, and I just did sterotactic core biopsy for microcalcifications on the same sight as the first one was, or very close to it. I am waiting for results!
I am really upset that I was treated so blatently, after all, Cancer is Cancer!

							I too had DCIS > 5cm - ER/PR -, Her2 3+, comedo type, high grade, DCIS microinvasive, and when the pathology report came back from surgery they also found LCIS  ----- thankfully negative nodes.  I had opted for a bilateral because my mother had breast cancer and I had a biopsy in the other breast 3 years ago (thankfully it was benign)  

When my daughter and I were first talking with the surgeon he said no radiation but definitly chemo.  Then when I opted for the bilateral it ended up that I needed neither.  My oncologist said she would have prescribed Tamoxifin if I was ER/PR + but she felt the risk/benefit of prescribing Herceptin or another chemo was not worth the risk. 

I wish you luck.  This is definitly not a ""club"" that anyone of us ever wanted to join.  It is wonderful to have websites such as this one (thank you Leo).  You will learn a lot and what ever you do - write your questions down to take to the doctors with you.  If at all possible - take someone with you to your doctor visits.  At the encouragement of a book i bought called Idiots guide to surviving breast cancer I started a file.  I have all of my ammmography and pathology reports (be sure to ask for them), my notes from questions and answers, and I have all of those dreaded insurance forms/paperwork all in one place.

Congratulations on the success of your cancer web forum. An oncologist faces many challenges, the greatest of which is helping patients fight daily battles against cancer that are not always won. However, widespread patient exposure to internet sites such as this can be a time-saving asset. The more educated a patient becomes of the disease, the more compliant they become. And while physicians can also learn from this, an essential component is solid communication between doctor and patient.

As patients and caregivers launch their explorations into medical cyberspace, they are finding out more about their disease, researching therapies and therapeutic alternatives. They begin to question and challenge, however, properly managed, the internet can enhance the oncologist-patient relationship, rather than undermine it. Patients can be directed to sites that improve their lifestyle, motivate greater levels of therapeutic compliance, cut down on basic questions, help combat illness more effectively, increase wellness and prevention skills, and maintain overall wellness.

The internet, when used correctly, can be a powerful educational tool. You have used it wisely. Thanks!

							I am happy that I have found this site, perhaps now I will be able to have some questions answered that I dont seem to be able to get answered by the Oncologist.  Firstly what are markers, what is the significance of the markers reducing from 15 to 10 to 7.5?
						

"
"


							Tumor markers are proteins found in blood the levels of which correlates with the type and activity of some cancers. Some tumor markers are antigens, others are enzymes.  Please note that they are not always a reliable means of tracing tumour development. Depends on what sort of cancer is concerned.

Last Thursday I went for my regular, yearly check-up with pap test, etc. As Dr. was doing pelvic exam she noted ""fullness"" on my right side & asked if I ever felt bloated. I didn't quite know how to respond & asked her why she asked, did she feel bloating inside me (hahaha). She said she felt something she shouldn't be feeling & set an appointment for me to have a Pelvic Ultra Sound. She continued to say that I shouldn't lose sleep over anything ---(easy to say)--- that perhaps it was unpassed stool in my colon. OK, if she thinks it is stool in colon why wouldn't she suggest a followup visit in a few days AFTER stool was passed to see if she felt same ""fullness""?

U/S appointment is Oct. 28th --- 10 long days away. Needless to say, I have much, much anxiety about the big C........I cannot sleep, cannot concentrate, a real worrywart, etc. I lost my sister (aged 53) in 2001 --- internal squamous cell cancer throughout her abdominal cavity found in a late stage --- so I have these visions of becoming as ill as she was.  

I have no real questions, I'm aware that there are no answers until after the results of the test are in. However, how does one cope with this horrible waiting before testing?

							Hi RedRose

Thanks for posting ! As you said, this is probably nothing, but doctors can not be certain that this is nothing, that's why they're doing the US. The abdominal exam can be difficult, and feeling ""fullness"" may be just stool, gas etc. So try not to worry too much, and get the US next week.

							HI,
I had a 5.5 cm tumor and 9 positive lumph nodes out of 16 and they didn't do a PET on me.  From what I understand, insurance will not or doesn't like to pay for them without a ""good reason"" and they are also prone to false positives.  I had a CT Scan of my chest, chest x-ray, labwork, the CMP, the one that shows all the enzimes in the liver etc. and I had a bone scan.  I was ""high risk"" because of being Stage III and being ""young-just turned 43).  That showed them that I had no distant mets but also no other local mets besides the lumph nodes.  A PET won't show up cells, they will show up tumors early, but if there are cancer cells floating around, they won't pick them up.  

I did get a PET in Dec. of 2002, which was 6 months after chemo and 3 months after radiation.  The only reason my insurance paid was because, I think the CT of the chest showed ""activity"" but was consistant with the scar tissue from the mastectomy BUT and I understand no one want to say anything 100% just incase there is a fluke, but it said the only way to be sure would be with a PET.  Anyway, I had the PET and I did show activity where the nodes were removed, but on a scale of 1-5 it was a 3 and my onco told me that we would see activity there.  I also lit up on my thyroid, again a 3.  Blood work showed that the radiation had damaged my thryoid and now I'm on meds for that.

My PET in 2002 was $800.00 and I'm in Alabama and from what I've heard, the cost can vary several hundred.

If you feel confident in your oncologist and he's done or is going to do the tests that they did on me prior to treatment, I would feel confident that it hadn't spread anywhere else.  The bone scan, CTs and labs tell me alot.

Best of luck and keep us posted

since september 14th i have had a cat scan,  a pet scan,  a needlebiopsy
while having a catscan,  and thursday i am scheduled for two needlebiopsys during yet another catscan...........given the more or less
normal amount of radiation one acquires over a lifetime---dental,  mammograms,  assorted broken bones,  various illnesses requiring
x-ray......when is it too much?

maybe i am just nervous about the results of tests to come and looking for a way out,  but i would be grateful for your kind response.

							Hello,

It is extremely difficult to get problems with radiation from diagnostic tests only. As you are telling me, you are well within the tolerated range, and this should not be a problem at all. 

The problems are usually associated when you need continuous radiation for procedures, like coronary angiograms, when you need to have real-time vision using fluoroscopy. See this link http://www.fda.gov/cdrh/rsnaii.html

So don't worry for now

							Hello,

I'm doing research for a friend who was recently diagnosed with stage 4 entrometrial cancer.  She had surgery 9/25.  Her uterus was far gone and is now gone.  Several visible cancers remained.  Cancer cells found in her lymphatic system.  Not good.  Very, very not good.  Her surgeon says that most people she sees with that level of involvement don't last a year.

On the plus side, my friend is  younger that most folks with this diagnosis (51) and was in very good health. She also has a brother who has moved for the duration and a pretty good support network. 

Tomorrow she finds out more about what's being proposed for her in the way of followup radiation and chemotherapy. Near as I can tell, radiation is somewhat straightforward -- they blast the known cancers and hope for at least some reduction.

Chemo seems more vague.  A number of different chemicals might be used, responses can vary a lot, and we'd like to know a whole lot more about what to ask and what to look for.

Could someone point me at some resources?  The more technical the better.  I'm not a medical professional but I can call on some people who are.  Plus, my friend is the kind of person who prefers meaty information. 

Thank you very much for reading this post, and I hope whatever problem brought you to this site has a much better five year survival rate!

I pasted below an excerpt from Up-to-Date. I hope it is helpful. As you know, the prognosis is not good, but there are some options available.





			
				MANAGEMENT OF RECURRENT OR DISSEMINATED DISEASE ? Women with inoperable recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer can be treated with hormonal therapy, chemotherapy, or radiation.

Hormonal therapy ? Women with well-differentiated tumors that express estrogen (ER) and/or progesterone receptors (PgR) are more likely to experience a response to progestin therapy than those with hormone receptor-negative tumors. Several progestins (eg, hydroxyprogesterone caproate, medroxyprogesterone acetate) have been investigated, and they all have similar response rates (15 to 30 percent) [96]. An oral progestin (eg, megestrol acetate [160 to 320 mg per day]) is the agent of choice. The use of higher dosages (eg, 1000 mg/day) does not improve efficacy [97], and increases the likelihood of side effects. The duration of benefit is limited; average response duration is only four months, and mean survival is 10 months following the institution of therapy.

Tamoxifen, a selective estrogen receptor modulator (SERM), also appears to be effective in women with advanced and/or recurrent endometrial cancer, either alone or in combination with a progestin. Although preliminary results from a GOG trial using tamoxifen with either medroxyprogesterone acetate or megestrol acetate demonstrated response rates of 32 and 26 percent, respectively, the combination of tamoxifen and a progestin has not been shown to be more effective than progestin therapy alone [98].

Other SERMs are also active in women with advanced disease. As an example, arzoxifene, a third generation SERM, was associated with a response rate of 31 percent in 37 patients; all responders had progestin-responsive disease [99]. Arzoxifene is not commercially available in the United States. The antitumor efficacy of two available SERMs, toremifene and raloxifene, is unknown.

Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs have also been evaluated in patients with advanced endometrial cancer, with objective response rates between 9 to 28 percent; response rates are lower in the setting of prior progestin treatment [100-102].

The combination of hormone therapy and chemotherapy is discussed below.

Chemotherapy ? Both single agents and combination regimens of cytotoxic chemotherapy have been studied in women with advanced endometrial carcinoma.

  Single agent therapy ? Doxorubicin, cisplatin, carboplatin and topotecan are all active as monotherapy, with response rates of 20 to 28 percent [96,103-105]. Most of these responses are partial and of short duration. As a salvage agent, paclitaxel has a reported overall response rate of 27 to 37 percent [106-108]. Dactinomycin had a 12 percent overall response rate in one GOG study [109].

  Combination chemotherapy ? Although response rates for various combination regimens that include cisplatin and/or doxorubicin are slightly higher (36 to 67 percent), progression-free survival has generally been only four to eight months [78,110-115], and in randomized trials, there is no evidence that survival is prolonged with cisplatin plus doxorubicin compared to single agent therapy [116].

Paclitaxel-containing combination regimens have not been directly compared to single agent therapy. Early studies of paclitaxel with either carboplatin or cisplatin suggested response rates between 50 and 56 percent, and an improved progression free survival rate compared to historical experience with other regimens [117-119]. Moreover, these regimens may be associated with a long-term survival benefit in women with primary advanced endometrial adenocarcinoma with as well as the more aggressive nonendometrioid adenocarcinoma histologies (see ""Papillary serous and clear cell endometrial tumors"" below).

This was illustrated in a report in which 63 women with locally advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer received 28-day cycles of paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over three hours) plus carboplatin (area under the concentration x time curve [AUC] 5 to 7) with or without radiation therapy [118]. Three-year overall survival rates for women receiving combined therapy for locally advanced disease were 39 and 62 percent for those with nonpapillary and papillary serous cancers, respectively. Furthermore, the median survival duration for patients treated with chemotherapy alone for recurrent disease was 15 months.

The superiority of paclitaxel versus nonpaclitaxel-containing combination regimens has been evaluated in at least three trials:

   In a GOG trial that randomly assigned 314 women with advanced or recurrent endometrial carcinoma to doxorubicin plus either paclitaxel (24 hour infusion) or cisplatin, the group receiving paclitaxel did not have a better outcome in terms of response rates (40 versus 43 percent for doxorubicin plus cisplatin or paclitaxel, respectively), disease-free, or overall survival [120].

   In contrast, better outcomes for paclitaxel-based chemotherapy have been suggested in two trials [121,122]. A French study randomly assigned 67 women with recurrent or advanced endometrial cancer to 21 day cycles of doxorubicin (60 mg/m2 day 1) plus cisplatin (50 mg/m2), or carboplatin (AUC 5) plus paclitaxel (175 mg/m2 over three hours) [121]. In a preliminary report, carboplatin/paclitaxel was associated with a higher response rate (35 versus 28 percent), and a greater likelihood of disease-free (35 versus 24 percent) and overall survival (41 versus 27 percent) at 15 months. There were no major differences in toxicity profile.

   Similarly, GOG trial 177 randomly assigned 273 women with stage III or IV or recurrent endometrial cancer to doxorubicin (60 mg/m2) plus cisplatin (50 mg/m2) both administered on day one every three weeks, or the three drug combination of doxorubicin (45 mg/m2 on day 1), cisplatin (50 mg/m2 on day 1) plus paclitaxel (160 mg/m2 over three hours on day 2) with G-CSF support (TAP) [122]. Response rates were significantly higher with TAP (57 versus 34 percent), as was the duration of median progression-free survival (8.3 versus 5.3 months) and overall survival (15.3 versus 12.3 months). TAP was associated with more grade 3 neuropathy (12 versus 1 percent) and grade 3 symptomatic heart failure (three patients receiving TAP compared to none receiving doxorubicin plus cisplatin), although less grade 4 neutropenia (36 versus 50 percent).


Based upon these results, the GOG is currently conducting a randomized equivalency trial of TAP versus carboplatin plus paclitaxel in patients with measurable advanced and recurrent endometrial cancer.

Other chemotherapy combinations such as cisplatin and vinorelbine are also active and well tolerated [123]. Nevertheless, the demonstration of superiority of any combination regimen will require a randomized trial that shows a survival benefit.

  Chemohormonal therapy ? Combinations of chemotherapy with hormonal treatment have also been extensively evaluated in women with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer with some evidence of benefit.

   In one study, 23 patients received carboplatin, methotrexate, and 5-fluorouracil, in combination with medroxyprogesterone acetate (300 mg orally each day) until progression (JMF-M regimen) [124]. Objective response was seen in 17 patients (74 percent), with two long-lasting complete responses (9 percent). The median response duration was more than 10 months (range 3 to 45+) and the median survival was more than 16 months (range 2 to 45+).

   In a second series, fifty consecutive patients treated from 1978 to 1985 received melphalan, 5-fluorouracil, medroxyprogesterone acetate (MFP regimen) as first-line therapy, and 50 additional patients treated from 1987 through 1993 were prospectively treated with cisplatin, adriamycin, etoposide, and megestrol acetate (PAV-M) [125]. Response rates for MFP versus PAV-M were not statistically different, but there was a significant advantage for PAV-M in two-year (45 versus 14 percent), five-year (30 versus 5 percent), and median survival (22 versus 9 months, p = 0.00 in women with primary advanced endometrial adenocarcinoma. PAV-M also appeared to be better than MFP in patients with papillary serous and clear cell cancers (see below).


  Summary ? It appears that combinations of chemotherapy and hormone therapy may represent optimal treatment for patients with advanced or recurrent endometrial cancer; the best regimen is unknown. Megestrol plus cisplatin and doxorubicin, PAV, or paclitaxel and carboplatin appear to be reasonable choices.

							HOW DO YOU KNOW IF THE MELANOMA HAS SPREAD?  WHAT ORGANS, IF ANY, DOES IT AFFECT?  HOW DOES IT KILL?
						

"
"


							Hello

Melanoma is a very aggressive tumor. The most well-described factor that predicts if the tumor has or is likelly to spread is the depth of invasion of the initial lesion. There are 2 classifications for this: Clarke and Breslow





			
				Clarke's Level
The first way tells us through which layers of the skin the melanoma has penetrated. When the skin is viewed under a microscope there are several distinct layers, each with a different appearance. The pathologist assigns a ""Clarke's Level"" between one and five. This is always written with Roman Numerals. Level I is the least deep, just penetrating the outer epidermis of the skin. Level V is the deepest, down into the fat beneath the skin. The Clarke's Level is different than the ""Stage"" of the melanoma, which is also written in Roman Numerals.

Breslow Depth
This system describes the actual thickness of the melanoma in millimeters. This is also used because the skin has different thickness on different parts of the body. The skin on the back is very thick; but the skin on the face is very thin. We usually divide patients into four groups based on thickness:

    * less than 0.76mm (about 1/32 of an inch)
    * 0.76-1.5 mm (1/32 to 1/16 of an inch)
    * 1.5-4mm (1/16 to 1/6 of an inch)
    * >4mm (over 1/6 of an inch)
			
		

To know whether it has spread one needs to define the clinical stage of disease, that can be done by sampling lymphnodes and doing radiologic studies such as CT scans and others.

Melanoma can kill in a number of ways, such as lesions inside the brain, lesions in the lungs, bones etc. There are so many different things it can cause, such as infections, obstructions.

							The first place melanoma spreads other than the skin is the lymph nodes -- usually the closest lymph node basin to the primary site. For instance, my primary site was my upper left back. When the cancer returned in less than 2 years, it was in the lymph node basin under my left arm. I happened to be able to feel the tumor, but that is not always the case. If your primary tumor is over 1 mm, the standard protocol is to do a sentinal lymph node biopsy, which will show if any cancer cells have migrated to the lymph nodes. However, if your primary tumor was smaller than that, they don't do an SNB. So, unless you suspect that there's a problem (pain or node enlargement). you probably won't know that melanoma has spread. And most doctors will not run CT scans unless there's a reason.

If melanoma goes to your lymph nodes, you are classified as Stage III, and usually the protocol at that point is to continue to have regular CT scans, or at least X-rays. That's the only way to detect melanoma. There is no blood test, so microscopic spread isn't possible to detect. 

If you ahve more questions about melanoma and would like to hear about experiences from melanoma patients, visit www.MPIP.org. It's a lively bulletin board dedicated to melanoma patients and their loved ones. There's even a chat room.

							Hello all;

This has explained a lot!

Just over 10 years ago I had a mole change colour. The 1st biopsy was inconclusive, then I waited almost 6 weeks for an appointment at the cancer clinic.

At the clinic they simply removed the mole and sent me home. Two weeks later I went back to find it was melanoma, but so very very small that it was well below any of the sizes mentioned here.

I went back every 6 months for 2 years and have been watching other moles and trying to stay out of the sun ever since.

Recently, with my wife's breast cancer, I began to wonder why they never tested me the same way they did her, with SNB, etc.... Now I know why.

So, thanks for this info.

							MY 75 YO HUSBAND WAS DIAGNOSED WITH METASTATIC MELANOMA SKIN CANCER OF THE LUNG IN JANUARY 2004.  HE IS STARTING TO HAVE SYMPTOMS OF NUMBNESS IN HIS TOES AND WEAKNESS IN HIS LEGS.  HE CONTINUES TO PLAY GOLF AND GO ANYWHERE HE DESIRES.  HE IS A VERY STRONG PERSON.  HE CONTINUES TO HAVE CT SCANS AND IT SHOWS THAT SOME OF THE NODULES ARE THE SAME AND MORE HAVE APPEARED.  HE IS TAKING CHEMO EACH MONDAY X 3 AND OFF ONE WEEK AND SEES THE DOCTOR AND THEN ON AGAIN FOR 3 MORE.  THE CHEMO DOES NOT MAKE HIM NAUSEATED BUT IT IS CAUSING THESE OTHER SYMPTOMS.  HE HAS A MASS LESION MEASURING ABOUT 5.0X6.2CM IN THE LEFT CHEST.  HOW LARGE IS THIS?  HE IS ON COUMDIN 7.5 TO 10.  THIS IS EVERY OTHER DAY.  DOES THIS HELP TO REDUCE THE MASS?

       Melanoma can spread to the lungs, bones, brain just about any organ in the body.

							yes there are blood tests to check for cancer tumor markers, not cancer itself but markers. My doctor told me the same crap, like i was an idiot or something, CA 19-9 test, CEA CRATE and a bunch of other tests that check for cancer markers. If it has spread to one of the lymph nodes youd have to do alot of the blood tests to see exactly where it has spread to to check em all but it would at least tell you. How do you think they used to tell people they had cancer back in the day before all the cat scan and mri and pet scan stuff.

							Hi,

Stage 5 Melanomas are very difficult to treat due to their spread to lymph nodes and other parts of body.

This includes remocal of palpable lymph nodes , sentinel lymph node dissection in cases of non-palpable lymph nodes, chemotherapy and immunotherapy.

The 5 year survival rate is about 14% in late stage melanomas.

Also these people generally are more inclined to develop another melanoma in future. So regular examination is important.

Hope it helps

							I had a lumpectomy for a benign fibroadenoma 3.5 years ago while lactating.  Ever since the lumpectomy I have had pain in my right breast.  It is not a focal pain although there is a small spot just below the incision that stings slightly.  THe pain radiates through my shoulder, down my arm.  It almost feels numb or tingly at times.  It is very annoying.  Six months ago I had an annual mammogram.  The pictures from the rt breast were questionable after being compared with prior mammograms.  There was a spot that was described as an asymmetric focal density.  I went back for more pictures and an U/S and it was determined (with markings) that the spot was the actual scar tissue from the first lumpectomy.  Prior mammograms had not included the scar tissue area because it was so far up toward my arm pit.  I had a full clinical examination at the time.  So here I sit with pain still in this right breast, shoulder and arm.  I want to think it is something like arthritic pain but want to make sure I did everything to rule out a malignancy.  I'm not sure where to go now for further evaluation.  The pain I have does come and go but is not cyclical and is definitely only on one side.  Any suggestions?

							Hi everyone.
My mother (stage 4 metastatic lung cancer) has recently developed a strange rash all over her body.  It started on her torso and has now spread to arms, legs, back.  The rash is not bothering her at all.  No itching or burning or swelling.  Since it is not bothering her, she will not let me take her to Dr. untill Friday as we have an appt. then.  I tried to call the Dr.  yesterday but he was out of town.  Should I be very concerned?

She has finished radiation 2 weeks ago, is still on Temodar for her brain mets, and is also on anti-seizure meds and an antibiotic called Bactrim.  I am concerned that it is the Bactrim that is possibly causing the rash although, she has been taking Bactrim for 2 months with no problems thus far.  I will be calling the Dr. again today about this but wondered if anyone had an answer for me for now.
Thanks for your time and replies!

I think you should take her to the Dr. You're right that meds can cause a rash, but that is usually itchy. And she is undergoing treatment for her cancer, which could cause her platelets to fall, and low platelets also can cause a rash. So convince her to go to the Dr. !

							Hello,

Monday I went to Dana Farber in Boston with my best friend for a second opinion.  She is 51 years old, has four children and lives in an environment with extremely high breast cancer rates.  Her mother also died of breast cancer many years ago.

Having said that--- the doctor we saw told her that her cancer is incurable and to expect the worst.  (In so many words.)  Here are the circumstances:

My friend has had cancer three times.  The first two times she was diagnosed with DCIS.  She had one lumpetcomy with chemo and radiation.   The second time they removed the breast.  Both times the cancer appeared on the same side of the body.  No radiation or chemo the second time.

This third time began like this:  Experiencing extreme pain in the same side again, they did a PET scan.  They found cancer in a horse shoe shape between two ribs on the chest wall.  They tested the tissue and found that it was Estrogen and progesteron negative but Her2-neu positive. (3+) I don't think there has ever been any lymph node involvement  and no mestastasis beyond the chest wall.  (so, I assume, this is called a regional mestastasis versus a local or distant.)

I don't know the size of the tumor.  All I know is that it is a horse shoe sized shape, so I assume it is several small tumors rather than one.  The radiologists say there is no bone involvement now.

She was put on Herceptin along with navalbine and they'll consider radiation in the future.

Question:  This doctor we saw in Boston offered no hope.  He told her that if they ""can't cut it out and put it in a bucket, there is no cure.""  And that, if she wants to see her grandchildren then her oldest daughter ""better start soon.""  I realize his bedside manners are abhorrent, but is this  true?  Her cancer is inoperable, but is it true there is no hope?  Beyond miracles, etc.?

Any information you can give me would be most helpful.  My friend is not a ""researcher.""  She asks very few questions, in fact, doesn't really want to know, and is just going with the flow.  I, on the other hand, feel that the more we know the better choices we can make, so I'm trying to stay one step ahead of the game.

Thank you so much for your help.

Tearful in Boston....

Thanks for your post. From what you are telling me: your friend has a tumor with extension to the chest wall, making this a T4 on the TNM staging system, no lymphnodes or distant metastasis. So she is a stage IIIB.

Assuming all the data above is correct, I got the following excerpts from Up-to-Date





			
				Combined modality therapy utilizing induction (neoadjuvant) chemotherapy followed by locoregional therapy (surgery, radiation, or both) is emerging globally as the standard of care for LABC, including inflammatory breast cancer. On average, 75 percent of women have a major clinical response to induction chemotherapy, and roughly one-half of these are clinically complete responses (ie, no evidence of residual tumor on clinical or radiographic evaluation). One-half to two-thirds of clinical complete responses in the breast will be pathologically confirmed complete responses (ie, no evidence of tumor in the surgical specimen).

Several studies indicate a correlation between response to induction chemotherapy (particularly the axillary response), and relapse-free survival as well as overall survival. Patients with negative lymph nodes after neoadjuvant chemotherapy fare better than those with positive lymph nodes, and the risk of recurrence and death increases in proportion to the number of positive nodes (show table 1).

One of the major reasons to pursue neoadjuvant or induction chemotherapy is to increase the likelihood of successful breast preservation in women with large tumors, although this approach is not applicable to women with inflammatory breast cancer. Some concern has been raised about whether local failure rates are higher in women who required downstaging to be eligible for BCT compared to those who were candidates before chemotherapy (see ""Optimal locoregional therapy"" below).

Surgery should only be attempted if a macroscopically complete resection can be accomplished. Patients who remain inoperable after induction chemotherapy should receive locoregional radiation therapy with subsequent surgery, if feasible.
			
		

So if the tumor is unresectable, therapy is usually chemotherapy and radiation.

							Hi Margot,
How lucky your friend is to have you.  Hopefully Dr. Leo can answer a lot of your questions.  I don't think your friend's diagnosis sounds as ominous as the doctor at Dana Farber seemed to say.  I read the www.bcmets.org website a lot, and the women there who all have distant metastasis are living many years with mets to the bones, liver, lungs, etc., with a decent quality of life as well.  You said Dana Farber was a second opinion for your friend, what was her first opinion?  I say she needs to keep looking until she finds a doctor that will make her feel supported and hopeful regarding treatments that may be able to extend her time and maintain the quality of life she has been enjoying to the greatest extent possible.  And definitely check out the bcmets website, the ladies there will have all kinds of information for you and your friend.
Wishing you both all the best,

							I agree, your friend needs to find an oncologist that is supportive and will treat aggressively.  There isn't a cure for any breast cancer.  Hers are local mets, so she's not a Stage IV, but Stage IIIB.  Sorry, I know the one before me told you that already, but it's 2:15 a.m. and my brain isn't working and I can't remember who posted to call her by name....sorry.
I've seen Stage IV ladies live many years with distant mets, some they get stable and of course some they don't, but you're not looking at Stage IV.
I was dx Stage III with 5.5 cm tumor and 9+ nodes out of 16, so I was a Stage IIIA, but thank God, 2 years and 8 months later, I'm still doing good with NED (no evidence of disease).

She truly is lucky to have you as a friend.  I know what it's like to be the one going through this journey from hell and unfortunately, I know what it's like to stand by someone who's dealing with it, so I know what it's like to be on both sides of this disease.

My suggestion is encourage her to at least get a 2nd opinion.  From what I know of Her2, they use herceptin only with a reoccurence, not during the original dx, correct me if I'm wrong Leo.  Did they give her herceptin when she had her 1st reoccurence?  The chemo you mentioned I've seen used alot with ladies with distant mets, so it must be good if alot are getting it.

I find it hard to believe that it's hopeless as he's implying unless there is more to it then we know, but it sounds like you have been there with her and know everything that has been said, so where there is life there is hope.  I'm sure she's beyond depressed hearing the way her onco phrased things, but she'll get mad and put her fighting armour on again and fight this beast!!!

Hugs and prayers for both of you

							Hi dear sister's friend.

While I was still working I was posting on AOL's BC site.  They have a whole section of women who call themselves ""Stage IV Amazons"".  Some of these gals are 17 years and more living with mets.  They find them and then they just zap them as they pop up.

Of course, not everyone is this lucky.  Some go quickly and others not.  Who knows.  But I would surely recommend that your friend find someone with a broader view.

And if possible, have her connect to this site.  I only had it at work so I have lost contact with this site but those gals were wonderful and very helpful to each other regarding Trials, new ideas, etc.

							Hi. I am wondering what kind of treatment is the best to treat colon cancer? Is it just chemotherapy? What about alternative therapy?  I saw some articles mentioned that Yoga is actually can cure colon cancer.  Moreover, i heard that a change in diet is needed.  What kind of diet should the patient adopt?  

Please advise.

Thanks.
						

"
"


							Denise,

If we consider traditional allopathic Medicine, the treatment for colon cancer usually involves surgery and chemotherapy. 

There is a lot of talk about alternative medicines, but it is difficult to state if any therapy is efficacious without putting it to test using scientific methods, which are not usually done for these therapies.

What I know is that keeping a good mind and spirits mean a lot. People do better when they participate and believe in the treatment they are receiving. If alternative therapy like Yoga does not harm you, I see no reason why you could not try it in addition to standard therapy.

In terms of diet, it depends what kind of surgery (or not) you have. You will need help from a dietitian for that.

							Hello Leo;

My wife has seen the oncologist at the cancer clinic and it turns out that the original pathology testing in September did not include hormone receptor tests. So the samples were ordered from the hospital where the surgery was done and the tests are being run now.

From all that I have read, I would have thought that testing for this would be so totally standard that to not have it done would be exceptionally unusual.

This has slowed everything down by almost 2 weeks.

What do you think? Is it unusual?

							Pastor Rich, As Nancy ( Hi Nancy) has said that it is unusual for them not to test for er/pr and her2neu when they do the initial pathology... however I also note that you are not from the states, perhaps the process is different in canada.  I know that women that I have knows from canada have had scans, testing etc on different time frames from me.  You are talking about two different treatment delivery systems.  I can also relate to the anxiety of the waiting... that is something that we all get accustomed to, not any less anxiety but used to the wait... hurry up and wait... but I can only say that from the time of my diagnosis and my intial chemo treatment was about 2 months... this was 6 years ago, next month.  In most cases Ihave been told that cancer does not spread rapidly in two weeks and that in actuality it is around for many many years before it starts to be able to be seen or screened in many.  I hope that this would help a little... though I am not a doctor and you would probably feel better hearing this from Dr. Leo.  Actually when I was first diagnosed they actually did test for both these things however there were women that were diagnosed 6 months prior to me that had to have their docs go back and have theirs tested, especially the her2neu, In PA where I am from they keep pieces of your tumors or lesions for many many years in order to retest if something comes up... according to the docs around here.  So even in six years we have made some progress in what is going on around us... 
  I Wish the best for you and your wife in this journey, and will keep you in my prayers and thoughts...This journey, though not an easy one, it is doable and as Nancy says there is life after this part of your journey, I would also add that there is a whole lot of life even when you are dealing with all of this it just refocuses your priorities.... a whole lot of living and life!  Just Hang in there!

							Pastor Rich,

Thanks for posting. I hope things are going well. Currently for all newly diagnosed breast cancers, it is pretty standard to test for ER/PR status, and most places also do HER2 identification. HER2 status is more complicated since it uses a different technique and it may take a few days.

Maybe some institutions prefer to have the cancer diagnosed, and if the patient accepts therapy, run the tests later on. It may just be an option to save money. Imagine if we get a biopsy on a very old lady and knowing that it is cancer she refuses treatment...the ER/PR/HER2 would be unnecessary, right ? I understand Canada has a different health system, and that may be the reason...

							I hope someone could possibly give me some information. I am 38 and went in to have my first ever mammogram from finding a lump. It was a ""routine"" mam, however I was sent immediatly to my dr. I was then informed I needed to see a surgeon, and have a biopsy done along with taking a node, that its very good chance its cancer. I had a very large size mass with a cluster or microcalcifications, with about 30-40 in there.

I was not prepared to hear what I was hearing for just having a ""routine"" mam.  I was finally scheduled for a stereotactic needle core biopsy 2 weeks after that. Living in a rural community with very little rescourse here everything is a waiting game. (no breast specailist & only path @ hospital that does the reading)
Any way a couple days later, I returned to the dr to find out the results, I was told everything was fine it was benign, and that I was fine. If I have anymore problems to come back. 
Well I still feel the same hard lump in addition to a new little one. 
So I made another appt and made a list of questions and showed her (the dr) the new one. 
I found out that my first mam BIRADS rating was a 4, now keep in mind I only had 1 mam and then a biopsy. Last Thurs I was scheduled for a chest xray and a ultrasound of the same area that was in question. As, well as talk of having the lump(s) removed.
I got a copy of my path report and here is what is says.
Focal, mild usual hyperplasia.  Sclerosing adenosis.  Perilobular fibrosis.  No evidence of atypia or malignancy.  Microcalcifications.

I have several questions. 
1. If its not cancer, then why am I having a ultrasound after the bipsy and chest xray?
2.Do I have something to worry about, can you tell me what the path reports means?
3.Should I consider having the lumps removed?
4. Should I request a 2nd opinion on a path reading?
Any type of replies would be greatly appriecated.
Thanks for reading my book lol

							Hi, I know you feel confused, and I guess I would be too. If it were me, I guess I would be pushing for a surgical biopsy. The steretactic could have missed something. I would be heading back to the doctor for a follow-up, especially with a new lump. One web site you might want to check to get a better explanation of the path report is Imaginis.com. I am sure Dr. Leo will chime in with additional information. Take care, Lauri
						

"

							I absolutely agree, get a incisional biospy.  That is the one way to be sure of what's going on.  
I'm not sure about this, so let Leo ""chime in"" (I loved that).  I never had them, but was told that microcalifications could be the 1st sign of trouble.  A friend had a mastectomy and wanted the other breast removed (she was like me, stage III, large tumor and alot of nodes) but insurance said no.  When they found microcalifications, the insurance approved the other mastectomy.
I'm not trying to scare you, but don't ever let anyone tell you that you're too young, or ""let's watch it"".  I think most breast cancer survivors will tell you, the only good lump is one in a jar!!!!

							Hi,
Its possible that the second lump you are noticing is a hematoma caused by the stereotactic biopsy.   I had a gigantic one after my biopsy.  It showed up on an MRI I had a couple of weeks after the biopsy.  The MRI showed my 1 centimeter tumor right next to a 1.5 centimeter hematoma.  The hematoma eventually goes away, it gets reabsorbed by your body.  A stereotactic biopsy creates a huge hole in your breast that fills up with blood which then clumps and hardens.  This is a hematoma.
						

"
"


							Well I actually wondered if the new one was some form of scaring perhaps, however the original biopsy done on 10/5 was done around the 2oclock position in the middle of my breast between nipple and collor bone area. 
The new hard lump or knot that I am feeling is just up from my nipple in the areola area.
It is a bit smaller than the tip of my middle finger.
When I had the chest xray on 10/21 they also did blood work. Went in on 10/22 for a ultrasound. I am not sure as to why I would need this type of tests if my path report says benign. 
I still would like to know what exactly my path report is saying. All I got out of my general surgeon is that I'm fine.
If I am fine then why the extra tests?
Thanks, for your posts and help!

							Hi ""Confused""

It took me a while to answer, but I am here 

Your pathology report really looks good. What we look for are obvisouly cancerous cells, but also pre-cancerous changes, such as atypical hyperplasia. This would be a read flag, and the pathologist states that he did not see any of that. Adenosis means an excess of gland in that particular area. Microcalcifications are certainly a radiological red-flag, but it's not always cancerous, as in your case. Honestly I don't see anything concerning for malignancy, but if you have doubts and would like to have an excisional biopsy (to take the whole nodule out) it would not be unusual. If it bothers you I think you should talk to your doctor.

Another option is to have your biopsy read by another pathologist. You can request your paraffin blocks, slides and reports and have it sent to another institution.

Leo

							Hi dear, for what it is worth, I had a stereotactic and it came back negative.  For some reason, the radiologist was not happy and insisted on a biopsy.  It came back positive for a 3mm cancer.

It was so small, the sterotactic missed it.  Remember, the only way to know for sure is a biopsy.  This is not too bad.  There are few nerves in the breast.  I just had a local and got up after an hour and went to lunch with my husband.  Really nothing to it.

Sooo, just another viewpoint.  Shirlann

							Thank you all for your advise, and Leo! I still am very confused on what to do.
I went in this past Friday for a ultrasound,(finally) and the site where my sterotactic(which removed 12 samples)was preformed was still 6-7cm.

I am wondering, should I seek out a second opinon from another doctor, (being a specialist), radiologist, and pathologist (whole new team). and see what they say before having an excisional?

Or should I just go ahead with a excisional with my current team?

My current surgeon is a General surgeon, not to discredit her by no means, its just for our area she is very busy and I feel tends to rush through my appts.

I am still very sore, and I still am worried about it. 
Can someone please let me know all about excisional biopsies what to expect, what its all about and also how accurate are the stereotactic's?

Thank you all very much for the advice already given. I am still trying to decide what to do. The dicission is very hard when you know little about nothing.

							Hi,
After my surgery I found a great site on the web that was called ""understanding your pathology report.""  I don't remember what website it was on, but if you do a search for those words you should find it, it wasn't hard to locate.  It might have been on the www.imaginis.com website.  Anyway, if your tumor is ER- and PR-, it just means you probably won't be prescribed any hormone based therapy, like tamoxifen.  You might be prescribed chemo depending on the size of your tumor and how many lymph nodes where involved, if any.  Nuclear grading is on a scale of 1 to 3, most people have tumors that are a 2 or 3, with 3 being the most aggressive.  Once you start to sort through it you'll see that its pretty easy to understand.

I had 9+ nodes out of 16, but because they weren't clumped together and were individual, I was  a N1.  The M is for distant mets.  If the tests they run prior to chemo aren't conclusive, you'll have a MX, meaning unknown.  I didn't have any, so mine was M0.
It will talk about er/pr, which you know what that is and also Her2Neu, that will be negative or positive and if positive, will be between 1 and 3 with +++ signs.
Take someone with you when you go.  It is so overwhelming that your brain shuts down after it can't absorb anymore.  I always took notes to ask and ask as many as you want answers to.
If there is anything specific, ask and if one of us doesn't know, we will sure find the answer for you.
Oh, also it will say if you have DCIS, Invasive Ductal, Lobular etc.  That's the type of breast cancer it is.
Hugs and prayers and don't hesitate to ask for antidepressants.  I don't know many if any that haven't taken them during treatment or wish they had.  I'm still taking Paxil 2 1/2 years later.

Sorry for not answering your question, I never got it... but anyway.

As said above, ER/PR- tumor cells won't respond to hormonal therapy. Unfortunately the prognosis is a bit worse in that case. Staging and grading are different things. Clinical staging means an assessment of how localized (or not) the tumor is, and is essentially what guides the treatment. A stage II has a very different treatment than a grade IIIB, for example. The grading is what the pathologist does when he looks at the cells. More differentiated cells, meaning tumoral cells that resemble the original tissue more closely have (in general) a better prognosis. So if the cells are undifferentiated, or poorly differentiated it is generally worse.

The links posted above will help you as well.

Questions to ask your doctor:
- What clinical stage you are
- What treatment options there are and the consequences in terms of prognosis, side-effects etc.
- What is the follow-up

I think that's what I'd like to know. Of course there are so many questions, but in general those should be helpful.

good luck !!

							[img] My daughter diagnosed with lobular carcinoma.  Given chemo (4) and had surgery: both breasts, ovaries, uterus removed.  Cancer cells found in all areas along with lymph node involvement.  Latest tests show metastases to the spine ( 2 places).  For now, no chemo, but will treat with hormome therapy: Femara, one a day; Zometa IV once a month at clinic and Zoloft for other treatment.  Is this terminal according to past experience?[/img]

							Dear Worried Mom,
I'm sorry to hear about your daughter's trouble.  At least it sounds like she is receiving aggressive care.  I think that all breast cancer that metastasizes eventually is terminal, but the real issue is one of time.  There are so many medications being used today that many women are keeping their disease in remission or stable for years and years.  You should go to the www.bcmets.org website, which is dedicated to women whose breast cancer has metastasized.  The women who belong to that list are so knowledgeable.  Many of them have been living with metastasis to the bones for over ten years.  I do not have this myself so I cannot speak from my own experience, but I am hopeful that your daughter will find a medication that works well for her and keeps her disease at bay for a long, long time.  My thoughts and prayers will be with you and her.

							Hello

Thanks for sharing your story with us. I feel sorry for your daughter. I have one view on things that may be helpful.

It is so hard to define what is terminal disease. Is it 6 weeks ? 6 months ? 6 years ? In a sense we are all slowly dying. 6 months to an 80 year-old person might not be terminal, actually this person may die of natural causes before the disease kills him/her. Another consideration is the functional status of the patient. Is she able to do her daily activities ? Can she take care of herself without assistance ? Is her pain (if any) well controlled ? 

That's why I think it is so difficult to say if this is terminal or not. Maybe someone that is paralyzed for 6 years is deemed terminal, but for that person that quality of life is acceptable. People have an amazing ability, which is to adapt to new conditions. Some people adapt better and faster than others.

So you and your daughter should focus on extension of life that is acceptable to her. Your doctor is providing adequate treatment, and if you are satisfied with it, try to work with him in the areas that are not so well. 

If there's anything I can help you with, I'll be here.

							I am 65 years old and have had a mastectomy of one breast. The surgery was performed 6 months ago and I am taking Tamoxifen. My obgyn suggested it might be a good idea to remove my ovaries. However, my oncologist seems to think it unnecessary because the ovaries no longer produce estrogen. I would appreciate another opinion or opinions?? I have read that the removal of ovaries  is recommended for premenopausal women but what about post menopausal ?
						

"
"


							Hi,
I don't know the answer to your question, but just wanted to say I would listen to an oncologist over an OB/GYN on this issue.  Your oncologist is the one trained to treat cancer.  I too have only heard of oopherectomy for pre-menopausal patients.
						

"
"


							Linda

I think your oncologist is right. Your ovaries at this age are not producing estrogens anymore. But the rationale for removal might be that you are at higher risk of ovarian cancer. Maybe given your family history (if you have a history of ovarian ca, breast ca), it might be reasonable. But for treatment of the breast cancer per se it is usually not indicated for post-menopausal women.

I am 6 years post treatment for Medullary BC.  This question is not directly related to this.  I have a pretty steady blood pressure of around 135/94  more or less.  I am 69 and I wonder, should I be on a blood pressure pill?  Would this adversely affect my BC status, of no new disease?

							Hi Shirlann

Your blood pressure is already abnormal. But the diagnosis is confirmed by 2 measurements that are abnormal on two sepparate visits. Depending on your risk factors for cardiovascular disease, you could be started on treatment. No matter what, the doctor will advise you on dietary and lifestyle changes: weight loss, salt restriction and exercise. 

So I would recommend you see your primary care doctor to evaluate this. It will not interfere with your BC.

Cancer of the pleura is not always mesothelioma. Many cancers can generate metastasis to the pleura. But if this is a cancer that originated from the pleural tissue it is mesothelioma. Mesothelioma is not always caused by asbestos, but it certainly increases one's risk for developing it. Even people without exposure can have it, though.

Prognosis is not good, but there are treatment options...there are no curative regimens for it.

 Almost 2 mo. ago a lump was found in my breast . 3 cm w/ microcalcifications . After more tests I was sent to a local Surgeon . He and the Radiologist felt that the growth looked very suspicious . The surgeon wanted to do a stereotactic vac. assisted biopsy but because the Hospital wouldn't allow him to perform it himself he decided to just do a FNA . The site wasn't cleaned and nothing appeared to be sterile . He didn't even hold the lump between his fingers. He just drew a circle on my breast and inserted the needle . The report was inconclusive and this Surgeon wants to excise the "" tumor "" as he referres to it . He says that waiting any more than 4 wks would be "" a threat to my health "" . I made an appt. at Wake Forest Comprehensive Cancer Center to get another opinion . The Surgeon called and told me that his feelings were hurt . This guy is new in town & I'm wondering if he is a "" quack "" . I am really nervous about my upcoming appt. now ( 29th ) Do you think the Specialists at Wake Forest will do something more invasive than a FNA ? Should I request that they do ? How accurate is a FNA ? I need for this to be over . I can't sleep , am nauseated all of the time and my 2nd Grandchild is due next mo !!! What should I do ? - Teresa

							Hi Teresa,

I get bad vibes just reading about that doctor!  Always listen to your gut feelings.  It's VERY unprofessional for a doctor to call you and say you have hurt his feelings!  A GOOD doctor will WELCOME a second opinion.  I think it's wise if you stick with the cancer center.  I hear they have excellent reputations.

Regarding the FNA - I had that done after I found  the lump in my breast.  It came back negative but the surgeon said we still had to take the lump out,  ""just to be sure.""  It's a good thing.  I had the excisional biopsy done and they found it to be cancer.  My surgeon said that the FNA can have a high false negative rate.  Sometimes the needle only gets a tiny specimen and the test is not accurate.

Good luck and prayers to you.  I feel for you and  hope that all turns out well.  I think you'll be in good hands at a cancer center or a big teaching hospital.

							Hi, When I was diagnosed they did all these tests to prior to starting treatment.  It was to not only get an overall picture to see if anything had spread but also importantly to get a base line of what is ""normal"" for you.  So that if one was to have any pains anywhere or problems they could see if there were any changes that needed to be addressed.  It is very nerve racking having the tests and the waiting but it is also wonderful to hear that there are no other problems.  Good luck to both of your wives!

My mother had a mastectomy 10 days ago. Path report says the tumor was 10 cm, 20 positive lymph nodes, estrogen-negative and HER-2-Neu positive. Surgeon said she is Stage III+. Pre-surgery CAT scan of her chest and abdomen + blood work indicate it has not spread to major organs and no sign of other tumors. She has not had a bone scan.  Surgeon has recommended aggressive chemo + radiation.

She met with Radiologist today for an intro appointment. Radiologist felt a lump in her remaining (right) breast. Says it feels like a cyst and recommending surgeon examines on Thursday when she has second drain tube removed (hopefully). Nothing showed on mammogram in right breast 1 month ago.  Is it possible that the cancer could have spread and grown this much in just a month?

Any thoughts on the cyst and her prognosis?

Thank you.
						

"

							Hi,
If there is a lump in your mother's other breast, it doesn't necessarily mean that the cancer spread and grew.  It could be that there was something on the other side all along that was missed in earlier tests.  What kind of testing did she have done earlier?  If she only had a mammogram, it could have missed something.  If she had an MRI, it would be more likely something would have been seen.  I seems like if it was another area of cancer they would have noticed it before now.  Hopefully it is only a cyst.

							Hi AuntieMo.  Hopefully your mom's bone scan will turn up negative.  Has the oncologist offered her Herceptin?  Does she have any heart problems?  If her heart is OK, I think the best thing is to include Herceptin with chemo.  If her cancer has not metasticised to her bones, she may have to enter a clinical trial to get it.  Some oncologists prescribe it ""off label"" so ask.  Just be sure to have her followed with MUGA scans every few months if that's the way you go.  I was also HER2 + so I entered a trial to get it.  So far it's worked well for me.  Good luck!

							Susan,

Thanks for your response and words of wisdom.

Just a quick update to my original posting -- the lump the Radiologist felt in my mom's right breast was examined by her surgeon and he did not feel anything abnormal.  He's going to examine her again in a month.

The Oncologist got her bone scan report while we were in the office on Thursday.  There were three areas of concern (spine, right femur and left rib area), but the Radiologist couldn't be conclusive on whether or not it was cancer.  He said it could be arthritis, cancer, or something else (can't remember).  After the Onc appt. we had to walk over to the hospital and have those areas x-rayed.  Probably won't know those results until next week.

The Onc did say that if there is cancer in the bones, then she will be Stage IV and can't be cured.  She is still treatable, but he just couldn't ever prevent the cancer from returning.  She starts chemo next Thursday; she'll have four cycles of Cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin via IV (every three weeks x 4).  She'll have a week's break and then start treatment with Herceptin and Taxane on a weekly basis for a year (if it shows signs that it's working after the first few treatments).  She'll be able to start the radiation treatments after the first four cycles of the Cyclophosphamide and Adriamycin.  The radiation will be five times per week for six weeks.

We're taking it one day at a time and hoping for the best.  

How long were you receiving Herceptin treatments?  What kind of side effects did you experience?

All the best to you for your continued good health and recovery.

							Maria, I can not answer in regards to tomoxifen being less effective with Her2neu... Not being a doctor I can only give you general info about what I know... that is the tomoxifen attacks the er/pr part of the cancer by cutting down as much estrogen as it can through the ovaries, which based on your status the er/pr has been feeding the cancer.  The Her2neu is a different part of the whole scenario... the her2neu is a protein (I believe) that also contributes.  The tomoxifen, or arimidex (if you are postmenopausal) will take care of the er/pr part.  If they want to attack the her2neu then they will use herceptin which attacks that part.  I dont think that the tomoxifen is any less useful in this, it is just that there are two issues to deal with.  They can also shut off the estrogen with other stuff like lupron.  The difference between the tomoxifen and the arimidex, as I understand it is that they work on different systems.. the tomoxifen working in the ovaries and the arimidex working in the adrenals...thus tomoxifen for premenopausal women and the arimidex in post menopausal women.  I know that all of this is very overwhelming but hold on to your hope  and talk to your doc about what he feels will work best .  I am sure that Dr. Leo will get back to you on this as soon as he can!  Hang in there!

							Hi there. I'll try this and see if anyone might have some ideas...

Presuming that the biospy result for mm comes back negative, the persistent lower back pain of the last four months is explained away easily after the bone scan results come back, the chest xray says I've just somehow developed asthma in the right lung to make it ""weasy"", and the 22 lbs weight loss I experienced between July & August turns out to be simply incredible good fortune are there any NICE explainations for my apparently enlarged liver too?

FYI - I have not been diagnosed with anything. I have spent the last four months being tossed between referral here, wait period there, test there, etc, but not actually being told WHY... (pretty good for a 33 year old without any prior history of anything abnormal beyond an appendix removal at 10 huh?). 

Now obviously each of the ""symptoms"" I've described can be easily ignored and fluffled off as essentially harmless and wholly coincidential (unrelated to each other).  Just as obviously, I should remain patient and wait for the test results. But damn, I'm so tired of not even being told what we might be doing these tests for precisely. 

I understand the melanoma possibility because of the lesion and biopsey, and I can explain away everything else to myself (though the weight loss was NOT stress related - I *know* what stress is for me - so had to be good luck), but I do not understand what we're looking at with the liver. A ""well, gee, it's possible that it's something not too serious such as... "" would have been nice to hear. Likewise, if it's NOT possibly something unremarkable, I'd like to know that these tests are important and not merely a waste of time? Please? Ideas? Help to ease my brain?

FYI, the doctor said the liver is ""palpable below costal margins"". When he ""found"" it, it was very tender and I finally clued into why I've been increasingly uncomfortable in most sitting/lounging positions (even had to switch the sleeping on the stomach habit), though I hadn't realized the liver was actually enlarged until he said it was. There are no other symptoms (such as jaundice or ab pains - unless someone is touching the darn liver! - nausea, etc..).

Any ideas? Please?! More precisely, is there ANYTHING that can cause a liver to become enlarged that I should NOT worry about (it'll go away on it's own type thing)?

Thanks so much for your time!

							Hello

Reasons for enlarged liver include hepatitis, which means there is inflammation of the liver cells. There are several reasons to have hepatitis, such as viruses, alcohol, fatty liver and others. Other reasons include blockage of the blood vessels draining the liver (rare). 

Just wait for the results. There are so many causes of hepatomegaly, some of them are reversible, others are not.

							I had posted the ""cancer or not?"" post and since then, I had returned to my General Surgeon last Thurs. and had blood tests done and chest xray. I then went back the next day(last friday) or a ultra sound... for the left breast(same one the sterotactic came back as negitive).

I called the dr office today and got the results of my test. my chest xray and blood test came back ok, although my cbc was a bit more elevated than normal but its ok and nothing to worry about is what I was told.

My ultrasound on the other hand, had some questionable results. The nurse told me there was a small cyst that dosn't look normal, that it appeared more as a ""shadow"", the dr wants to see me for another breast exam and another ultrasound.

my ? is if my biopsy came back as benign then why I am still having these tests? Is this normal?
Also what would a shadow looking like cyst mean? Has anyone ever heard of this or had this happen?
Should I be worried?

Thank you for you imputs and my thoughts and prayers are with everyone fighting this disease.

							Confused, Sorry that I certainly have no answers for you.. I will say however that your docs seem to be right on top of all of this for you.. which is a good thing, as worrisome and scary as that is.  If they are concerned about a shadow that appears as a cyst then taking another look at that and possibly biopsy seems to be the thorough thing to do.  I have an ultrasound done on my remaining breast all the time.  This past year I had the ultrasound and they saw what they believed was a shadowy cyst like growth, you could feel it too.  I had the sterotatic biopsy and it was a cyst.  As scary as all this is , and waiting and not knowing fully is the pits, it is a good thing that they are not telling you to wait 6 months to watch it, like so many do... it is good that they are keeping on top of it and sounds like you are getting some good treatment in the meantime.. take a deep breath and best of luck with your results!

I have just finished 5 months of chemo---receiving treatments every three weeks.

							Hello

If you had a mastectomy you do not need mammograms of that area anymore. However you need mammograms of the other breast, once a year is the recommendation. I am not sure if your insurance would pay if you wanted to have it more frequently. I understand your desire to have frequent and have early detection of any abnormality, but the medical literature states that 1 year intervals are enough. Radiation associated with a mammogram is not high, you should not have any problems even if you get it every 6 months.

							Hi,

I was wondering if anyone could shed some light on the 'accepted' method for categorizing someone as pre or post menopausal. The reason I'm asking is because some cancer treatment is based on that status and I got different responses from two different doctors. Before starting my chemo this year I was 50 and still having some periods but they were spread out, not a regular monthly thing anymore as I presume I was heading toward menopause. When I initially met with my oncologist he said he would do some blood work to determine my menopausal status and from that he said I was post menopausal and that after treatments I would go on Arimidex (vs Tamoxifen). Thereafter I spoke with another doctor to get a seond opinion on some things and that doctor said if I had had a period in the recent past I was still pre-menopausal and did not give any merit to any blood work to determine the menopausal status. That doctor said I should go on Tamoxifen after treatment rather than Arimidex. I'd appreciate any comments on this differing assessment and how I should really be categorized, pre or post?  

Thanks

							Hi

Menopause by definition is lack of periods for 1 year, and elevated FSH (follicle stimulating hormone). You can have a transitional phase referred to as perimenopause or climateric phase, where you can have irregular periods, but your FSH will already be elevated. Many people call this phase menopause as well. 

About the Arimidex versus Tamoxifen, many people use Tamoxifen as first-line therapy, however there is some evidence of Arimidex being superior, but this is debatable and opinions diverge at this point.

regards,
Leo
						

"
"


							I still have some confusion that maybe you can clarify.
It is my understanding that Arimidex is only for post menopausal women.  1) Why is that and what happens if it's take by someone who is pre- or peri- menopausal?  2) Given the status of my period as previously described would you say I should consider myself post menopausal and therefore a candidate for Arimidex? or only if I was to be tested now and find elevated FSH 3) I didn't have any further periods once I started the chemo so does that mean I should start out on Tamoxifen and then could switch to Arimidex once I have gone a year without a period? 

It is great that you are able to make this forum available!

							Gail,  I too was premenopausal when I started chemo.. also started tomoxifen prior to chemo... but after I was done with chemo I was tested to be post menopausal.  I also switched from the tomoxifen to the arimidex.  I switched due to a skin reaction to tomoxifen, and this was after the testing showed that I was post menopausal.  I was 45 at time of initial dx, and had my last period right after my first a/c chemo.  If you were premenopausal when you started chemo, as I was, then the chemo put me into menopause.  This has been my experience... thus I relied on the fsh test to dictate whether or not I was post menopausal.  Best of luck to you in your further exploration of this.

Same here Gail when the exception of age, but not by much, I had just turned 43 when I was dx.  I never had a period again after I started chemo, started on Tamoxifen and because of being Stage III and Arimidex showing to be superior, my onco did a blood test to see my status.  I was post MENTALpausal, so I changed to Arimidex.  He thought I'd start again within 6 months, but when I didn't, that is when he ran the test.

							Hi

The problem with receiving hormonal treatment if you are still producing estrogens is that the drug may not work well because it will compete with estrogens for receptors. Also, all the trials are made with clearly defined populations of post-menopausal women, therefore there is no data to know what happens with other groups of patients.

Based on what I know, if you have a high FSH I'd consider you post-menopausal. I'd talk to your doctor about these issues, including what you discussed with us, so he can explain the rationale for starting (or not) treatment.

							Hi,

As I mentioned previously, after completing chemo my oncologist put me on tamoxifen which I have been taking for over a month now.  Since starting the tamoxifen, I have become quite self conscious and embarrassed because I have grown a lot of facial hair. I did not ever recall anyone mentioning facial hair as a tamoxifen side effect but I was digging around for information on what might be causing it and came across the following side effect listed for tamoxifen at one of the breast cancer care web sites:





A small number of women notice an increase in downy facial hair or changes to their singing voice


I know that I should just be happy to be alive but this side effect is driving me crazy and doing nothing to boost my already depleted self image or confidence as a woman. Has anyone else experienced this problem and does anyone know of any possible remedies? I guess there are some hair removal treatments but I don't know anything about them or how safe they are. Suggestions anyone?

I'm sure I won't come across many other people who've experienced this one...

							Estrogen can come from 3 sources: ovaries, adrenal gland, and fat tissue.  My understanding is that Tamoxifen blocks estrogen from any source.  Arimidex stops the adrenal gland from producing estrogen.  Therefore, your ovaries have to have stopped on their own (either through menopause or surgery) for Arimidex to be an option.

							Hi,
I was diagnose in 04/03 with DCIS, right breast.  Had the microcalcifications removed, then wide tissue excision, then 7 weeks of radiation.  I am on tamoxifen for five years.

I have had different things happen with my right breast that when I go to the dr. it is all dismissed with, 'Well those things happen sometimes after radiation'  The different things have been rashes, burning sensations, swelling, clear liquid from the nipple.  So now I just accept things are going to be different with that breast.  I have regular check-ups and just had one in Sept with mammogram and it came back negative.

My question, for the past two weeks my right breast is getting bigger than the left.  It is at least one bra size bigger than the left.  Is this still something that happens?  I hate going to the doctor for another symptom if it isn't anything to be concerned about.

							Hi, I did not have a lumpectomy... well I did but ended up with a mastectomy... The reactions to the radiation that you are describing were according to my friend who had rads after lumpectomy, are things that she experienced up until the enlarging of the breast, hers actually shrunk in the long run.  However, I would encourage you to follow Dr. Leo's advice and make that appointment.  I know how you feel about running back to the doctor about these things.. sometimes I start to feel like a hypochondriac... however, it is your body and anything that makes us feel uneasy after the experiences that we have had need to be addressed.  If the doctor still does not feel as though it is an issue, know that it is an issue to you and seek that second opinion.  All to often there are some doctors that give us the attitude that we should feel grateful that we are here to complain and have concerns and they minimize the way that we feel... however, in the long run, we have been through it all and we deserve to have our concerns addressed.  If you feel as though your doctor is not giving you the answers and the attention that you need then perhaps you should start to look for another doctor who is willing to be part of your team and not minimize your concerns.... good luck and let us know what you find out.

							Hi, I started this post as a guest.  I have been to my gyno and she examined my breast and felt some lumps, I think she called them nodules.  She recommended that I go see my surgeon and see if she will schedule a MRI, as I just had a mammogram in Sept.  My questions:

1. What are the differences between a mammo, songram, utrasound and MRI?
2. I was told that I can't get a MRI in the city that is closest to me, but other people I know have gotten them for other things, so is a breast MRI different than another kind?
3. How common is it for cancer to reoccur in the same breast that had DCIS, but all was removed, and radiation treatments done and tamoxifen therapy (16 months).

							Hi,
Any of us, regardless of stage, kind, with/without node involvement could have a reoccurence at any time. I 'm definately not saying that is what has happened to you, but if you find a lump, you need to have it biopsied.  That is the only way to be certain and I mean an incisional biopsy, sometimes the needle biopsies can be misleading.  They can get clean margins, saying there is no more tissue around the lump and know that they got all of it that way, but the main reason I got a mastectomy, and then other was because there could still be cancer cells floating around, that have not yet clustered together enough to be picked up by test.  There is not a test either to see if it got into your blood stream.  I know the odds are very high mine did with being StageIII and 9+ nodes, but I have seen tiny tumor and no node involvement have reoccurences.  Again, I'm not trying to scare you, but if you have any questions or concerns and there's a lump........the only good lump is one that is in a jar.

They are too small to biopsy.  Nothing else except the axillary lymphnode. We had the node retested at a different hospital and still positive. All doctors are saying breast cancer because of the axillary node, but nothing shows up. Someone through out there that maybe when the node was tested that possibly the equipment was not sterile and was contaminated by someone elses cancer cells.  How far fetched could this be?  Could this happen?  Is it possible to have the lymphnode test positive and not show up anywhere else? Could the cancer be so early/small that it cant be detected?  Please help.

							PC Charms,  I have a friend who also had breast cancer show up in her lymph nodes and it was of undetermined origin.  Now Dr. Leo can tell you alot more about this then I can, however, I believe that each type of cancer shows up differently to a pathologist.  Thus they can tell if breast cancer has spread to another place... ex.  bc mets to the lung as opposed to a new primary cancer of the lung... I may be wrong but this is how I understand it.  My friend who they dx. with bc in the lymph nodes never has found her primary tumor etc.  but she did undergo chemo for her bc and has done very well and has been NED (No Evidence of Disease) for many years now.   I know that this probably does not help to ease your anxiety but I did want to share this with you.  You certainly have had the gammet of testing and if all is clear then that is a good thing.  Hopefully the chemo will zapped any cancer that they could have found had they not found the bc that they did in the lymph nodes.  If they do find the primary bc such as a lump or lesion initially they remove it but if it has spread to the lymph nodes they do systemic chemo in order to get the chemo to all parts of your body to kill any stray cancer cells.  So it sounds as if they are going to take care of that with the chemo.  I am sure that Dr. Leo will get back to you about this as soon as he sees it... but I know that the anxiety and uncertainy is the pits and wanted to share as much as I could now... best of luck to you... this chemo though unpleasant is doable...

Thansk for posting. I am not sure what you mean by ""testing"" the lymphnode, as there are so many things pathologists can do  to help identify the origin of the cells. Anyway, it seems they are convinced that this is breast cancer, otherwise they would not be starting chemotherapy. If they have enough evidence to support a diagnosis of breast cancer in the lymphnode, you should be ok. Also about your other question regarding contamination of instruments...I have seen one case and this was actually published, since it is extremely rare...you should not worry about this. I wish you the best of luck with your treatment, and we will be available !

							I am a melanoma patient, not a breast cancer patient. I'll tell you two stories.... One is of a person I know who was diagnosed with breast cancer, had a double mastectomy and chemo and then was found to have been misdiagnosed and actually had melanoma. She lost her breasts for nothing. But if you've had more than one set of pathologists check out the slides, you're probably safe. 

Another is not really a story... just a related fact. With melanoma, you can have internal metastasis even though the cancer never showed up on your skin. They call this an ""unknown primary.""  No one is really sure if the tumor perhaps came up on the skin and then regressed, or if it just never appeared on the skin. It's altogether possible that it could happen with other cancers as well.

Thanks for your reply. I had the pathology slide taken to another hospital for a 2nd opinion.  By reading the report on the biopsy they should be able to tell what type of cancer, correct?

							I am glad to hear that their are people out there with no primary tumor. I have stage IV breast cancer. with no primary. They found a subaceous cyst on the top of my head. Several doctors told me that's what it was. Four diferent doctors (plastic surgeon, neurosergeon,gp) all told me it was nothing and unless it started to bother me leave it alone. I left it alone for 3 years and then it started to hurt me when I brushed my hair. I decided to have it removed. Pathology came back metastatic breast cancer. I had every test imaginable and they could not find any breast cancer elsewhere in my body. I was even had an operation,laporoscipy, to see if it was in my ovaries. All were negative. Seven months later I went to a different plastic surgeon and had my scalp re-excised. Different hospital and different doctor. The report came back metastatic breast cancer. It has been 2 years from the last diagnosis. I am taking tamoxofin for the next 3 years. I already have taken it for 2 years and I have No signs of it showing up anywhere in my body. By the way, my margins were not clear the 2nd time I had it re-excised. I am suppose to live a long and healthy life. (except for the cancer) It has not affected me at all I just know it  is there and I make sure I take my tamoxofin everyday.

							2 1/2 years ago, I was diagnosed with prostate cancer with a psa of 300.  Had radiation treatments, seed implants and have been on Nilandron (hormone therapy ever since)  The first psa level after was down to 8, and has since been rising with each psa test.  I have been on the Nilandron and many other meds for various problems.  6 months ago, I started getting Lupron shots every 3 months, have had 2.  I just had another psa test andit is up to 112.  I am feeling fine, better than before this all started.  Can anyone tell me what is going on.  The Dr's can't seem to find a reason.  All bone scans, all other tests are negative or clear.

It would be useful if Bernie would provide info on his TNM stage and Gleason score at dx. 

Also: what is the current PSA velocity? That is, how quickly is it rising from test to test?

And regarding tests, has Bernie had a ""free PSA"" test? The lower the score, the higher the risk of PCa.

This sounds like hormone-refractory PCa cells are loose, but I'm uncertain. It is expected that androgen deprivation therapy (hormone therapy) will become ineffective in 18 - 24 months because the cancer cells (if any remain post-therapy) will adapt to the absence of testosterone and proliferate without it.

Until the cells ""take root"" somewhere, usually bones and/or lymph nodes, they are difficult if not impossible to find. They usually betray their presence via elevation of PSA.

What is the specialty of Bernie's physician; urologist, medical oncologist, radiaton oncologist, other?

							My friend had a core needle biopsy in a surgeon's office and the pain was so intense that she fainted repeatedly!  She is supposed to go back to have the other breast biopsied.  Is it possible to have general anesthesia for the procedure?  I could be in her shoes, and I don't know that I could stand it.  I only read that it is fine, with little pain. but I hear other things from coworkers.  Any suggestions?

							I had a core needle biopsy (guided by mammogram) in the hospital.  They used a local anasthetic and it was no where near enough.  I could actually feel the needle each time it cut, and it was horrible.  I was also in a lot of pain afterward.  I think the biopsy might have been more painful than the mastectomy itself, because after my mastectomy I was on morphine.  I think your friend must demand adequate pain relief next time.  I know if I ever have to have another one I will do so.  There is no way I would go through that again with what they gave me.

							That's unfortunate that your friend had such terrible pain.   I've had a core needle biopsy (done at a hospital) and I did not think it was that bad. I drove myself home afterwards. Everyone has a different level of pain tolerance, but even knowing this, I would hope her surgeon does the next one under some other form of anesthesia. Just my 2 cents. Lauri

							I'm sorry your friend had such a horrendous experience.  I also had an ultra-sound guided core needle biopsy.  I was given a local anasthetic and I made sure to let the doctor know when it was wearing off so he could administer more.  There was quite a bit of discomfort, but nothing I couldn't tolerate.  What I had the biggest problem with was the ""pop"" that the ""gun"" made with each and every snip!  The doctor kept getting after me to lay still.  
Maybe instead of general anesthesia, your friend's doctor could sedate her.   You know, the twilight sleep your given during a colonoscopy?  Best of luck to her.

							Dear PK:

I'm sorry to hear about your friends experience.  I recently had a Core biopsy guided by an MRI last week at a hospital. I was given Lycane (??spelling), like novacane.  They made a small incision and when the needle, that sounded like a drill went in it hit a muscle in my shoulder blade, very painful but they gave me another shot. It was uncomfortable and quite long, but nothing like your friend.  I do have a pretty high pain tolerance, but overall nothing unbearable. Maybe your friend should opt to have the other test done at the hospital or breast center and ask to be given higher dosage of Lycane and explain her concerns.

I wish your friend well and much luck.  Take care. PCharms

							I underwent core needle biopsy 3 days ago in the radiology dept.  At one point during the procedure I began to feel a ""pinching"" sensation and I immediately told the radiologist and he said ""ok, I don't want you to feel ANY discomfort, so I'll give you more lidocaine.""  And within seconds all pain was gone and didn't return.  Physicians are to provide adequate pain relief and most do if you let them know.

							My experience a couple of weeks ago was the same as wayover20's.  It started fine, and at about the third ""cut"", I started to feel a pinch.  I told them so, and they immediately shot me with more lidacaine, which took immediate care of it.  The key is to speak up.  
The worst part is the sound--it sounds like a staple gun, which is not a particularly pleasant sound to associate with things being done to your body.  But, fortunately, I'd been warned about the sound.  It helped not to look.  I just kept my eyes closed.

							I was diagnosed with bc in January by way of a core needle biopsy that hurt so bad I almost passed out.  They did the incision and they hit me with lidocane, but, it did not touch the pain.  I wonder why some hurt badly and it seems others do not?  Is it the technician and doctor making sure that you are numb, or the location of the area to be biopsied?  I was not dibilatated beyond the procedure, but, it was horrific pain while being done.

							I had my core biopsy with mammogram done this morning.
All in all, it wasn't as bad as I imagined. I received the freezing then immediately the first biopsy speciman was taken. That one hurt a bit, but the other three were not as bad. The Tech. then froze it some more, and did two deeper ones.
The worse part was being pressed in the mammo machine for 12 minutes, waiting for him to come in and start, but after that, it wasn't more than 5-6 minutes, and he was done!
The nurses were great, standing at my left side, one to adjust the mammogram settings-- one for encouragement ,and held my arm and squeezed when the tech. was going to ""shoot"" me. I kept my eyes closed most of the time.
Ladies, the apprehension is worse than the test. I had immediate ice on and iced steadily for 6 hrs, and only have a bit of tenderness this evening!

							I know this thread is old but I found it just before my recent bilateral breast core biopsies.  And it made me very nervous. So, now that I've had the procedure done in both breasts, I wanted to comment for others who may stumble upon this thread:

It didn't hurt.  Not at all.  And I think the Tech. took at least 5 samples from each breast.  So what I learned is the anticipation and fear of something is usually more horrible then the actual thing.  Now I'm not saying some people don't feel pain because I'm sure based on the skill of the Tech. and the area of the breast, pain could be felt.  But you can also make yourself a nervous wreck and be so scared you faint.

I usually stay calm, keep my sense of humor and try to breathe and relax myself.  The only thing I felt, and it was fast and barely noticeable, was the pinch of the needle to numb my breast. After that I was good.  When I was on my right side, I could watch the left breast on the sonogram screen and I did.  I'm not afraid of needles (some people are) so that didn't bother me.  I was making jokes about the Tech's aim.

So I wanted to simply say: if you have to do it, don't psych yourself out.  Plus it was quick.  I don't think it took 30 minutes for both breasts.  Anyway, now I have to wait for the results - 3 to 5 days - and again I'm breathing and staying calm.

							My sister in law has a rectal tumor (cancerous) the size of a baseball.  She has NOT had a bowel movement for 3 MONTHS.  She has had a barium enema NOTHING came out.  She has taken all there meds for cleaning out the colon.. NOTHING comes OUT... NOTHING.  She has just finished her 6wks of chemo and radiation, still NOTHING comes out.  Now they are letting her wait for 4 wks and surgery is the next step.  What is happening to all this waste and how can they possibly do surgery when she is so full?  They said the chemo and the radiation would shrink the tumor but apparently NOT or wouldnt she be able to have a bowel movement?> She doesnt think the doctors believe her when she tells them that she has had NOTHING come out of her for so long.  They pass her off and tell her to take a laxative.  The cramps and pain are sometimes almost to much for her to stand.  ANY ANSWERS>?

If she is eating she should have BMs with the tumor shrinking. Now, if she is not eating and on parenteral nutrition she might not have BMs during this period.

							I had bilateral mastecomies on 8/19.  The drain on my left side fell out after 10 days and the one on my right occluded and they pulled it after 16 days.  I've been seeing my oncology surgeon regularily and he has been draining fluid from both sides about every 2 weeks (usually 40-80 cc from each side).  The seroma on my left side was keeping my skin from adhering to my pectorl muscle which has a small hole in it.  The plastic surgeon won't do reconstruction until the skin is firmly adhered to the muscle.  I am so fortunate that I only had Stage T1A, no chemo and no radiation and I am really looking forward to reconstruction.  A drain was put in last week and it has been draining 20 - 35 cc in 24 hours.    I had a sentinal node bx with only three nodes taken so I have no range of motion limitation on either side. My question is this: What causes a seroma and what can be done to help it resolve?  Does movement of the upper arms aggravate it?  They did skin sparing mastectomies and there is a ""wing"" of skin that tends to hang out over the side panel of my bra.  Would this cause the seroma to continue to drain?  Does wearing the heavier prostheses cause problems.  Would it be better not to wear anythiing for a while?   I appreciate any help or advice you can give me.

Thanks!!!

							Hello

Seromas can complicate almost any procedure. It occurs when the skin does not ""stick"" to deeper tissues, therefore forming an area where serum accumulates. It is not infection, but this accumulated serum may become infected. The treatment is exactly what you are doing: drainage until the volume gets really low, meaning the tissues are finally adhering to each other, so no more fluid can accumulate. Usually movement is not a problem.

							Recently completed 12 treatments of chemo (5fu,lecv,oxy) after surgery for colon resection in March 2004.  I had 1 lymph pos and had penetrated through the colon wall.  No mets.

							Ok.  So I had only just started taking bio-identical hormones for a melange of issues (night sweats, hot flashes, cystic acne, irritability, lack of concentration, crying jags, etc.) when I was diagnosed with DCIS and the oncologist said ""you should not be using any hormones"".  This is my biggest GRIPE of all.   I want back on those bio-identical hormones!  I used the creams for about 3 1/2 weeks and it was unbelievable how they changed my life.

My question is....what do I do now?  I'm sick and tired of crying at the drop of a hat, waking up 2 or 3 times a night drenched in sweat (and that fragrance is not pretty), having to grab the nearest fan or piece of paper to cool off, acting like a nit-wit at work because I can't think straight, and seeing red unsightly cysts on my face that never seem to do anything but cause pain and make me feel self-conscious.

I want to start back on the bio-identical hormones but I promised the oncologist I would stay off of them until radiation is over.  

Has anyone gone back on the hormones after being diagnosed with DCIS with a Van Nuys Prognostic Index of 9 (3 for margins, 3 for grade and 3 for size)?

As a doctor, our advice is obivously to not use any hormones once you've been diagnosed with breast cancer. As you know we use drugs that counteract the effects of hormones to prolong survival (tamoxifen, aromatase inhibitors etc).

							As someone who has experienced most of the symptoms that you are describing (except the acne) and also tried all the remedies for such as flax seed, vitamin E etc.. I can only say that the thing that worked best for me was a small dose of antidepressant... it made the world of difference in all these areas.  The antidepressant that I took was Effexor.  I just stopped them this past june.  I stopped after 5.5 years.  It was a low dose and I had to increase it over the years but still a low dose compared to that given for clinical depression.  I also have many friends who take other antidepressants and feel that all of the symptoms associated with menopause have become much more tolerable.   I never took hormones prior to my diagnosis thus could not tell you the difference in the efficiency of such.  I would tell your oncologist that you are tempted to go back on the hormones and see if he can come up with an alternative treatment for you.  Ask him about the antidepressants.  Good luck and let us know what you decide to do...

							Hi,
I wasn't taking any kind of hormones when I was dx Stage III ILC at 43 years young, but I can assure you, I would never even consider taking them now, no matter what.  I was having all the same things you were describing when I was taking Tamoxifen, but I just had to accept the fact that for now, that's the way it was going to be.  As Barbara said, their are antidepressants that help and the main one I've heard of is the one she mentioned, which was Effexor.  I switched to Arimidex, and most of the symptons stopped, so I decided to stay on Paxil instead of switching.
You're playing with fire if you take any kind of hormones and it absolutely makes me mad beyond words that people are letting Suzanne Sommers come on their shows and promote the bio.....whatever hormones.  She said that she refused chemo because it was poison, but she's taking mistle toe extract, which is nothing but poison and she's taking it for 3 years....... give me my 6 months of the ""poison"" chemo that's known to work, I'm not playing with any of this alternative medicine.  My opinion is all it is, but that's after alot of researching, reading, studying because I wanted to live to be a ripe old age.  No, there are no guarentees, but I'll go with what gives me the best chance.  I do take a multi vitamin now, that I never did and I think as long as it doesn't interfer with chemo, suppliments are great.
I guess it's obvious I feel real strong about this subject and don't mean to sound so ""bitchy"" LOL.  
You've had your onco, Leo who was so wonderful to start this forum and 2 ladies that were both dx Stage III and have been where you are saying the same thing.  Please check with your onco about Effexor or another one that he might suggest and try them until you find the right one.

							Hi Nance!
I'm Nancy too!  Loved your post....really.  I appreciate your frankness.  Funny that Efexor has popped up as I just talked to my oncologist today.  She told me that my DCIS (high grade/5.5 cm) was 90% estrogen receptive.  She said that's good news except she knows I don't want the Tamoxifen.  I just have an aversion to anything that may affect my lower 1/2 due to all the trouble I've had with that area in the past.  I'm all for the radiation though.  

I did ask her if she received my last blood workup on my hormones as she mentioned the other drug (Arimidex) but said it's for post menopausal women.  I don't know that I'm quite there yet as I'm in the thick of the hot flashes/night sweats etc.  Drats.  Maybe by the time I'm done with my radiation, they can do more bloodwork to see if I'm there yet.  

Thanks again for your note Nance.  Take care.

							Hi Nancy,
I'm glad I didn't offend you and come off as I had my claws out.....LOL
You're stage III like me, but mine was Lobular.  You didn't notice if you had positive nodes or not.
I was 78/79% estrogen/progesterine positive and you being 90% is even better because that shows that you're more apt to respond to Tamoxifen/Arimidex in preventing a reoccurence, but of course we know there's nothing definate with this damn disease.
I wasn't even pre MENTALpausal when I started chemo, and that's why I was started on Tamoxefin.  When I hadn't had a period for 6 months after I was done with chemo, the onco did a blood test that showed I was post MENTAL (sorry, that is such a more appropriate spelling...lol) pausal and switched to Arimidex.
My suggestion..........again.... lol  is talk with your onco and weigh the pros and cons of Tamoxifen.  With your hormone reseptors being so high, again, it could really be a huge benefit to you.

							Hi Ladies,
Thanks for your replies and humor (much needed right now)!

Nance - you mentioned Stage III?  I thought DCIS (non-invasive) was Stage 0?  The Van Nuys Prognostic Index showed the highest risk factor (9) due to size, grade (comedo/necrosis) and margins (the first time around).  I didn't opt to do the sentinel node biopsy as the doc said most times with DCIS, the report comes back clean.

I'm definitely going to talk to the oncologist about my bloodwork to see if I can take the Amiridex instead of Tamoxifen.  I think that would make me feel more comfortable all the way around.

As far as the Effexor, I'm a little afraid of taking an anti-depressant for the hot flashes/night sweats.  Most of my life people have said to me ""you're always so happy"" that I'm afraid if I take something like Effexor, somehow I'll lose myself.  That probably doesn't make sense to anyone.  I don't know how else to describe it.  Kind of like my fear of taking Xanax (for my panic attacks which only started in '95 when I got injections of Depot Lupron for endometriosis).  Thank goodness I don't have to take it daily - or even weekly...only when my mind gets the best of me and then my DH insists I take it as I get so tearful and immobile from putting off taking it.

As far as the Paxil goes, no worries about the libido issue.  I've been ""non-existent"" in that area for years.  DH has had horrible trouble with hips for years and years and only recently got the left one redone (8 hour surgery) and then the right one was done this past May.  I guess it's good that he and I are in the same boat...but kinda sad too but you never know what God has in store.  I sure hope He's planning on us being health in 2005 though!

							My mom was diagnosed with recurrent BC after 17 yrs in Dec '03.  Had mast/chemo/radiation in '86. Biopsy in Jan '04 from neck lymph nodes revealed that it was recurrent BC (same cancer as in '86).  The PET scan showed the cancer to be in most of her bones and showed her spleen to be enlarged (which is what made her go to the doctors initially because she could feel it).  The scan did not show the cancer to be in the spleen - just enlarged.  She had four or five treatments of taxotere (once q three wks) and was rescanned.  Scans showed very little improvement but neither had it spread any place else.  She had one large (800 rads) dose of radiation to her hip in May.  Her spleen did decrease in size while doing the taxotere.  Her last taxotere treatment was in April.  She didn't have any treatment again until July and that was Xeloda (2 wks on, 1 wk off).  Her red count and platelet count dropped so doc stopped Xeloda after three rounds.  Finished last round Sept 2. Was transfused q two weeks for seven wks.  Her spleen is HUGE.  She is now getting only Aredia (q monthly) and Aranesp (biweekly).  The Aranesp has stablized her red count (11 last week) and platelets (77,000 last wk) although still low are higher for her than they've been in four months.  My mom has decided to stop treatment except for the Aredia and Aranesp.   Curious as to what your opinion would be for her.  She's otherwise a healthy 63 year old lady who was very active and takes no meds even now.  She has the same oncologist as she did 17 yrs ago, and he's wonderful.  Said the next chemo he would try would be Navelbine but in Sept said the risks because of her counts (6-8 red count, 25,000-38,000 platelets) were high.  My mom wanted quality not quantity of life.  In September he told her she had weeks to a few months to live.  We are approaching that timeframe and she's feeling pretty good - has her energy back, just got back from a ten day trip to see her mom and siblings and is virtually (knock on wood) pain free.  Suggestions?

Thanks for posting and sharing your mom's story. I am not sure about the cause of her enlarged spleen. Having undergone multiple chemotherapy sessions (and radiation), she is at higher risk for lymphoma, which could be the case. Another thing that could happen is if she has extensive liver metastasis or thrombosis of the portal venous system, the veins that drain the bowels to the liver. That could increase the pressure to the spleen and cause enlargement. At this point it is difficult to diagnose a lymphoma without a biopsy, but nonetheless I think it would not make a difference in treatment right now. You should ask her oncologist what he thinks about it.

							I am almost one year out of treatment and I was wondering about scans.
At the time of my dx 4/03 I never thought to ask for scans, in fact everything was such a whirlwind I didn't have time to think of anything.  After it all set in of course I had a zillion questions.  
I was dx with invasive ductal carc..1.6 cm with one node positive, er/pr postitive and HER2 postitive as well.  
Here is my question, I have never had a bone scan, CT scan, I did have an MRI because of a suspicious finding on the other breast, but other than that I have had no scans or routine blood work.  If I had them before I probably  would have been OK with that.  However, I am so afraid of scans finding something that now I don't know if I should ask to get them or not. So, does anybody think it odd that I did not have any scans, and should I ask for scan now???
Thanks

							Sounds familiar!  My dx was 12/03.  2cm tumor, one positive node, er/pr+ but her2-.  I have had no scans at all at diagnosis or since finishing treatment in July, not even an MRI in spite of the fact I have very dense breast tissue and original tumor didn't show on mammogram.  I've asked onc and he says he doesn't do them unless there are symptoms of spread.  I'm currently on Arimidex for 5 years.  Will be interested in Leo's reply to your post!

							I haven't had any scans either and I was diagnosed in 1996. I do have an annual mammogram and see my onc once a year (and I am several months late in seeing him   ) He has a series of blood tests done every year and said there was no reason to do scans since the blood tests always come back normal. He would want additional tests/scans if anything looked unusual, he told me. Lauri

							Hi Kristen,

This seems to be a problem and a worry among lots of women after being treated for BC.

I finished my treatments 8 months ago (IDC) and I have not had any tests, not even blood drawn.  The last time they drew blood was 3 weeks after I finished chemo (last Dec.) so we are coming up on a year.  They always say the same things - that if you don't have symptoms there is no need or that mets found early do not make a difference in survival stats.  But, honestly, I wish they would try and understand where we are coming from.  It's easy for them to say this and that because I don't think they truly understand the anxiety.  I realize some do not want any tests.  However, if a woman wants these tests on a yearly basis and it will comfort her I think they should be given.  I would feel better with a yearly bone scan and blood work but they won't budge.

If I were her2neu positive, I would insist on some testing because the recurrence rate is a bit higher.  But that's just me.

Good luck.  I hope everything works out for you!

Hugs,

							Hello

I understand your frustrations regarding the perceived lack of adequate monitoring. Current guidelines recommend: history and physical exam every 4-6 months, mammography once a year. I will paste what I read from the guidelines (NCCN, 2004):





			
				Posttherapy follow-up is optimally performed by members of the
treatment team and includes the performance of regular physical
examinations and mammography. In patients undergoing breastconserving therapy, the first follow-up mammogram should be performed approximately 6 months after the completion of breastconserving RT. The routine performance of alkaline phosphatase
and liver function tests are not included in the guidelines. In addition, the panel continues to believe determination of the available ?tumor markers? for breast cancer and routine bone scans in the asymptomatic patient provide no advantage in survival or ability to palliate recurrent disease and are, therefore, not recommended.
			
		

Most doctors feel more comfortable monitoring some blood work as well, so that it will be abnormal if there are bone lesions or liver lesions, for instance. This is a difficult subject, with extensive cost implications. It is the same as doing for example a chest x-ray of all smokers every year to look for early lung cancer. This was done as a trial, and did not help. Further studies about how to best monitor patients after therapy are still necessary, but the issue is: no matter how small (or big) a metastatic site is, the prognosis is the same, so detecting it earlier does not help patients.

							I am HER2NEU positive, ER-.  What I am confused about is this.  When you are  her2neu + is your survial rate lower?  It is so confusing.  I had five positive lymph nodes, invasive ductal, and had lumpectomy 5cm tumor.

							Hi Happyrock - Her2+ tumors tend to be more aggressive - but the good news is that there is a good treatment in the form of Herceptin - you should ask to enrol on a trial for this, as it is still only prescribed for advanced bc.
BTW - was your Her2 status diagnosed with the IHC test ? I know that this can give false positives.If so, ask to be retested with the more accurate FISH test.
It is all very confusing at first - you will feel better once your treatment protocol has been worked out.

							Hi Happyrock,

I agree with Sam.  There is a higher chance of recurrence....but you never know because lots of people who are her2neu negative and ER PR positive still have recurrences.

Her2NEU positive tumors are more aggressive and thus have worse prognosis. These tumors usually respond to a targeted medication called Herceptin (trastuzumab) in addition to other chemotherapy agents.

							Hi happyrock.  I'm also HER2 positive, ER-, PR+, 8cm tumor, 1 node +.  I enrolled in a trial and finished all my treatments this past July '04.  My chemo was 4x AC, then 12x Taxol & Herceptin (weekly), then 40x Herceptin alone (weekly).  If you decide to go this route, the best advice I will give you is to keep your eye on your ejection fraction (score from MUGA scan).  I started out low (55) before chemo even began and slowly declined.  When I got to 51 I insisted on being referred to a cardiologist, not because that's a dangerously low number, but because if you fall below 50 you are booted out of the trial and can't finish out the Herceptin.  The cardiologist put me on two meds, which I had to have approved by the trial folks, and I did fine and was able to get every last drop of Herceptin!  So far all is well and I am considered NED (no evidence of disease).  
So are you on antibiotics for your infection?  Let us know what treatment plan you decide on.  Best of luck to you.

In what is seen as a game changing event for the company, TapImmune (OTCBB: TPIV) announced on Monday that it had signed an Exclusive Agreement with the Mayo Foundation for Education & Research, Rochester, MN, to License a proprietary MHC Class I HER2/neu antigen technology.

""It's a new antigen that we've licensed from the Mayo Clinic and it's an antigen that no one recognized before for the HER2/neu receptor,"" explained Dr. Glynn Wilson, Chairman & CEO at TapImmune, during an exclusive interview with BioMedReports. ""The existing products in the market don't go the same pathway and so they're not as effective; and so we think that with our other approaches to HER2/neu, we'll have a real advantage and give us a leading position in development of a vaccine for HER2/neu -- both for therapeutic and hopefully in the future, prophylactic.""

After 20 years of HER2/neu vaccine development the scientific team at the firm feels they have a far greater understanding of the target, and indeed of the needs of cancer immunotherapy. 

Early on peptide vaccine studies showed that 'killer' T cells could be generated. At around the same time different peptides were shown to generate 'helper' T cells. To date, however, we have not seen a combined approach that provides a naturally processed killer cell target and a collection of broadly reactive HER2/neu derived helper peptides. 

With more than 200,000 women in the U.S. being diagnosed with breast cancer each year, 75 percent of whom test positive for the HER2 receptor, but only 25 percent are eligible candidates for Roche-Genentech's breakthrough drug Herceptin, a $5B a year product and some new drug candidates in late stage clinical development, we still don't have a comprehensive approach.

Observers believe that this is where this collaboration between TapImmune and the Mayo Clinic enters and bridges the gap, making what the scientific team at TapImmune believes will be the broadest and most comprehensive HER2/neu breast cancer platform available.

We know now that killer cell targets absent of T cell 'help' offer only short lived responses and do not generate T cell memory. In addition, scientists have figured out that using so called 'universal' T cell helper peptides does not truly deliver the need for 'locally available' helper peptides. These helper T cells need their antigens for stimulation and targeting in the actual tumor, where they need to function. 

Without getting too technical it boils down to this. Killers need both naturally processed targets AND they need T cell help. While helper T cells need stimulation as well, and this has to be accomplished in the same microenvironment of the tumor where these functions are being performed. This means that the helper peptides must be natural targets as well, and they have to be found in the same place and time as the killer cells.

							Hi

It is just practice to update your preventive services, so when you go to your doctor he/she should update things like immunizations, colon screening, prostate, etc. But it was thought that having breast cancer increased the risk for colon cancer, but a paper (Lancet. 2001 Mar 17;357(9259):837-40.) shows that there is no such link. There are some hereditary syndromes, such as Hereditary Non-polyposis Colon Cancer Syndrome, which is rare and affect individuals at an early age, and there are several criteria to meet this diagnosis.

							Mace- could be two seperate cancer sites not necessary connected to each other if it was in your lymphatic sysem (which you could ask the doctor ) then it could spread anywhere.  doesnt mean this is in your case, but they should be able to tell you that from your tests.

							There is also a risk of both cancers if you have Lynch Syndrome, another one of the genetic diseases.
Per my oncologist and genetic counselor, there are other genetic links out there between the two that they just haven't discovered yet -- they suspect my colon cancer is genetic (diagnosed at age 42, brother had a tubular adenoma at age 44) in some way they don't yet understand, even though we tested negative for Lynch, and told me to be extra-careful about mammograms and other breast cancer screenings, since my risk was probably elevated for that too. But that's all pretty theoretical at this point!

							Another rare but possible one is Cowden Syndrome.  I've had ovarian and breast cancer..also tubular adenomas removed this summer.  My genetic history provides no clue though because 1) my dad has had tubular adenomas 2) My dad's mom was recently diagnosed with early stage colon cancer 3) My dad's dad was diagnosed with and died from adenomcarcinoma (colon) in 1976 on other side 1) my mom died from adenocarcinoma of the colon in Nov 2010 2) Her aunt had colon-rectal cancer and died from it 3) Her grandma had colon/rectal cancer in the 1950's and died from it.
Literally as far back as my grandparents the only ancestors to not have colon cancer or the precursor were my maternal grandparents.  
BUT only known case of breast cancer is my grandma's aunt who died in her 80's.
Too many genes...not enough known yet.  One thing I find interesting about Cowden's is it is a defect in the PTEN gene.  Even in the normal population PTEN protein loss in cancerous tumors is very common.

							Hi,
Have you felt a lump?  My suggestion would be for your peace of mind is to go see a doctor.  There was a bill passed that made sure ever woman got a mammogram and pap smear once a year if they couldn't afford one.  Someone might know what it's called or a link to it, but I don't have it right off hand.  You might also call your health department and ask them and they would probably know.
I was a 36C when I was dx and just turned 43.  Mammograms are good for diagnosing, but they do miss quite a bit of breast cancer in women under 50 because of the breast tissue being so dense and in your case, you are very large breasted.  
I myself found a lump and it was time for my mammogram anyway. My mammogram missed a 5.5 cm tumor.  They can do an ultra sound or a breast MRI (new since I was dx) which I'm sure is more accurate.  I would say if you feel a lump, do whatever it takes to get it checked, with or without insurance.  And don't let anyone tell you that you're too young, there is no such thing.  But, also remember that 80% of lumps are B9.  I don't want to tell you that your symptons don't sound like BC because there is nothing normal about the disease, but more then likely it's not from what you're describing and from what I know but don't take that to mean not to get things checked out.  You've noticed a difference and your know your body and you have to listen to what your body is telling you.
Best of luck and let us know

							Hi, that's some insurance company your husband has. I thought a family policy covered all the members of the family.

I think you should get this checked ASAP.  I had similar sensations in my left breast, which turned out to be breast cancer.  There was NO LUMP and nothing palpable at the time I was diagnosed.

							Hello

Pain is usually not present in breast cancer, BUT it can certainly be present. Other causes of this would be trauma that causes what we call fat necrosis, or even in the absence of trauma, since your breasts are large. Other diseases that cause breast pain include mastitis or even fibrocystic breasts. As pointed out above, I would check with your Doctor. I understand you are uninsured at this point, but I think there are ways to get mammograms for free, and a consult will not be very expensive.

							Hi all.

My sister in law has recently been diagnosed with gastric cancer. She had a CT scan recently to see what stage it was at. She has now been told it has spread throughout her stomach and into her intestines, the initial concern for the doctors was if it had spread to her liver but it hasn't.
The details are rather vague as they don't explain properly, just ask if we have any questions. Under the circumstances we usually can't think of the right questions to ask at the time as this has come as a great shock to us, (she is only 41 years old).
The reason I am writing this is because they have decided to start her on chemotherapy next week but have told her that her condition is uncurable, on top of this they have also stated that they are just trying to ensure her survival for the next few months. Could this be the case that she may only have a short time left or is it possible that the hospital is being unneccessarily negative, also are there any other avenues we could explore for treatments which could help her, we are prepared to consider anything at the moment.
I understand that without seeing the results from the tests she has had it would be impossible to make a judgement but I can't help feeling that the hospital is judging the situation rather prematurely as no treatment has started yet.

Your opinion on this would be most appreciated.

							Hello

I am deeply sorry to hear about your relative. Stomach cancer is unfortunately very difficult to treat, and the rule of thumb is that if you can't operate and remove all the tumor, it is uncurable with chemotherapy. I think the overall prognosis that they mentioned is correct, unfortunately. There are chemotherapy regimens available, but they have limited efficacy. She may also look for clinical trials in case she is interested.

I have some more information as I have been talking to Jane's doctors and nurses, (Jane being my sis in law).
She has now started on her chemo treatment, the drug combination she is on is ECX, (epirubicin(E), cisplatin(C) & Capecitabine(X)).
I have asked various questions but I can't bring myself to ask anything that may lead to a negative response. The doctors can only tell me that Jane's life is in Gods hands now, only God can decide the outcome. As I am not particularly religious (although if I believed that someone was listening I would be on my knees praying as I write this), I do not find this a great comfort in this difficult time.
Jane will be on the treatment for 18 weeks continuously, every third week she will spend a day in the hospital to receive ""E"" & ""C"", then 12  150 mg ""X"" tablets every day until her next hospital appointment.
After the treatment finishes they have stated that they can only monitor her condition, they do hope to reduce the size of the tumor but still can't offer anything further regardless of the outcome.
I have researched as much as I can about the drugs she is on but the information available is either limited or written so that only a professional such as yourself can understand.
Is there the slightest chance that we could eventually opt for surgery to remove this from her or are we beyond that point altogether, I have promised my family that I will find any solution available for Jane if possible.
I will keep you informed of any more information I receive and I would like to thank you once again for taking the time to respond to my query.

Unfortunately even if she has a good response to treatment, trying to resect the tumor will not help, as it is almost impossible to get all the tumor. In the end, surgery may be worse for her, that's why chemotherapy is only palliative in her case.

I just came across this site and felt the need to respond.

I was diagnosed with esophageal cancer in early August of this year.  I was told that the treatment was chemo/radiation and then removal of the esophagus.  I sought a second opinion.

A different oncologist connected with Rush Medical Center in Chicago looked at the tests I had done.  He referred me to the chief of surgery at Rush North Shore who operated on me to place a feeding tube in my small intestine, a port in my upper left chest for administering chemo, and I gave permission for him to perform a laproscopic exam of my abdomen.  He came back with the diagnosis that it was not what my first exam said. The stomach was fully involved in cancer and it was starting to go past the GE junction.  

I underwent surgery on Sept. 2nd.  The surgeon took the whole stomach, the spleen and 60% of the pancreas.  He was unable to get a ""clear margin"" in the esophagus.  The surgery took almost 4 hours and the surgeon later said it was for him -- and me -- the equivalent of a heart transplant.  He connected the small intestine to the esophagus.  I spent five weeks on my back, three in surgical ICU and the next two in telemetry.  I was discharged on Oct. 5th.  

I am now a diabetic relying on two injections per day.  I have to eat 6 meals or snacks per day and be careful not to eat too much or too fast at any time.   

The week before last I underwent my first week of chemo.  It consists of Fluorouacil a/k/a 5FU, Leucovorin (a type of vitamin) and Heparin.  The chemo was 5 treatments.  On the Monday after Thanksgiving I will begin a radiation series which will be once a day, five days a week for five or six weeks. The first and last weeks will be a chemo treatment 24/5 using a pump.  We will see what happens then.

The last 8 days I have had some pretty severe mouth sores from the chemo as well as a rash.  Nothing I can't withstand.  The symptoms are easing at this point.  My oncologist will not give me a percentage chance of survival, possibly because I could sue him if he's wrong.  One study I read gives it at 3% if chemo only is used, and 23 to 30% if chemo is combined with radiation.  If I fall in that range then for me it is 100%!

I don't know if your friend's circumstances are close enough to mine to be comparable.  I offer my circumstances only as a guide.  Make up your own mind.  Who knows for sure, I could be dead in six months, or I could live another 20 years (I am 62 now).  I intend to fight with all my resources, however, including any forms of ""alternative"" medicine I find appropriate.  There are a lot of alternative treatments out there, some of which have been well researched.  I would suggest you investigate them if and when the doctors have given up.  

I am not a physician and am not trying to give any more than some information you could use as ""talking points"" with your doctors.  I don't want to imply you go against the advice of your doctors, but if they are out of treatment options it is time to look at alternatives.  

Hope this helps, and best of luck.

I don't know if the circumstances are the same or similar to your own Bob but thanks for the thoughts and I will be looking into any area of medicine that may help, (in addition to the treatment she is currently receiving not instead of).
I sincerely wish you all the best in your battle, you sound very determined.
One more point I would like to mention and if possible get some advice about is the problem started with an ulcer, at the moment Jane is having extreme difficulty eating. Not because she has lost her appetite but she can't manage to swallow food.Is this the ulcer or the cancer causing the problem or maybe both?
She is hungry most of the time but after eating a small quantity she feels full. This has led to a severe loss of weight.
She does have a problem with feeling sick but we have been told that this is a normal side effect from cesplatin so we did expect this.
My question is this:
She obviously needs to eat and drink to build up her strength, also because some of the medication requires food or a quantity of fluid. We have tried various foods which should be easy to swallow as well as a variety of prescribed high calorie drinks but she can't even manage these. Is there anything that could be done to help her eat and drink? Her doctors are not offering anything but is that because nothing can be done at present or are they just waiting to see if the chemotherapy will eventually help in this matter?

							Hello again,

I am not a doctor, as I said in my previous posting.  About 10 days prior to the surgery my surgeon (who actually looked at the stomach laproscopically) inserted a feeding tube into my left side.  It is called a J-tube because it entends into the jejunum (sp) of the small intestine.  It has a valve on the external end and I was fed through that because I could not eat or drink anything.  I was losing 1 to 1 1/2 pounds per day before he did this.  I don't know what Jane's doctors feel her condition is -- maybe they can't feed her that way.

I can't address the issue of the ulcer. 

It seems that the doctors have to answer your questions in some detail, and they aren't.  You (and Jane) have a right to know what the reality of the situation is.  That includes how she is going to live long enough to have the chemo work.  

My intention in addressing you is that I feel it important not to ""give in"" or give up.  I also feel you have to use a multi-level approach to beat this.  Positive attitude plays a part.  I wanted to share my experience because you have to know there are others fighting their own cancer (misery loves company).  Also, I don't know what Jane's faith is, but it is very important to pray and solicit prayers from friends and relatives.  Finally, look at alternative treatments so, if the doctors give up, you have something else to try.

							Hello

What is currently accepted is that peptic ulcers, the common ulcers we get in the stomach do not become malignant, what happenrs is that they start as cancers and look like ulcers. 

In terms of nutrition, if necessary feeding tubes can be placed that bypass the tumor, so nutrition can be given directly into the small intestines. But that is not always an option. Her early satiety is problably caused by more than one reason: the tumor mass, chemotherapy are all playing a role.

I think that, based on the information you have given me, we now have to wait and see how the chemo works. I am not a great believer in miracles but I certainly hope I am proved wrong. I will never give up hope, who knows what will be discovered in the next few years.

							Found the lump 2 months ago, and knew immediately that it was different than the fybrocystic changes I've had for 25+ years.  Took what seemed like forever to get dr appointment, another eternity for mammogram apptmt, yet another eternity for surgical consult.  Got the ultrasound guided needle biopsy pretty quickly after that, but only after being pushy with the scheduler.  Had the lumpectomy and sentinel lymph node biopsy on Thursday.  Node appeared clear, but am awaiting pathology report to be sure.  Surgeon is away this week--left me a voice mail today, but I couldn't make out more than his name--bad cell phone connection.

Anyway, I've kept up the positive face through this all.  Didn't tell anyone about it through the diagnostic period because I didn't want to upset anyone needlessly.  People have been largely supportive since I've revealed the diagnosis, but I am unable to feel anything.  I don't mean physical pain--though there's been very little of that.  I mean emotionally.  Everyone I know who has been through this says they cried when they first heard the diagnosis.  I haven't shed a tear.  I'm not afraid, I'm not sad.  I'm not anythng.  I tell everyone that the prognosis is great, that I feel great, etc.  Truth is, I don't know what the prognosis really is.  I'm just numb.  

When do I start feeling?  Or am I better off this way?

							Hi, welcome to the board. I know what you mean about not feeling anything. I remember being dxed in 1996 and I was not surprised the path report said cancer. I think the mind sort of shuts down for a while. I was calm and accepting, but the tears did come at the most unexpected times. Poor DH didn't know what to do except hold me close when I wept. Just keep putting one foot in front of the other and move forward. Please keep posting. I suspect you will need some support and comfort eventually. Hugs, Lauri

							Hello and Welcome,
    I would love to tell you that you are better off feeling nothing but that won't help anything. When I was DX I felt the world had come to an end and when I cryed I didn't think I was going to stop. I cryed so hard I even scared myself , but I did stop and I woke up to a new day and I even have some days when I laugh. Its been 5 months and the chemo is done and I have moved on to the rads. I still have days when my poor husband is not sure who I am but he just holds me until I can get a grip and then I just keep moving on. One day at a time. I am here if you just need to vent or to cry or what ever will help. You are in my prayers.

							A friend of our family and a 6 year breast cancer survivor, just found out that she has mets to the lungs. She is 76 years old, but the women in her family live to be over a hundred.

Her family is upset that she immediately said --NO WAY-- to any more chemo or radiation.  She wants to give up.  I told them to give her some time and she called my sister today and started asking questions, because I had told my sister that there were so many new treatments since 6 years ago.

I don't know her pathology, but I assume she was ER+PR+, because she has been on Tamoxifen for the last 5 years. She originally had lumpectomy, chemo, radiation, and then Tamoxifen.

She is looking for hope that there is something better than the treatments she already received. I have early-stage 1 BC, and haven't researched a lot about Mets.

My sister wants me to gather information for our friend, as she is not a computer user. She's convinced that if it didn't work 6 years ago and she has mets that there is nothing they can do and she is scared of the treatments.

Any advice or responses would be helpful and greatly appreciated. Then I could print out what you all have to say about it, and send it over to her to help her prepare for her upcoming visit witht the Oncologist.

							Hi,
A lot of new treatments for mets have come into use in the past few years.  A lot of oncologists focus on quality of life in treating mets, especially later in life, and she might not need to do any chemo right away, unless she is having serious pain or in danger from a met that is out of control right now.  If she is concerned about chemo or harsh treatments affecting her quality of life, she should definitely be informed that there are many alternatives available now, and she may be able to control her mets without sacrificing her quality of life for many years.  So don't give up hope just yet!

							I'm talking size of the lump here (now, what did YOU think I meant?.  My surgeon has told me, and I keep hearing elsewhere, that I need chemo because of the size of the lump (2 cm, per the mammogram), even though it at least appears from the sentinel lymph node biopsy that my nodes are clear (still awaiting the pathology report).  But I've not received a good explanation as to why the size of the lump compels the chemo, other than ""that's the standard of care"" (a phrase I am coming to dislike already).  Can anyone help me out here?
						

"
"


							Hi,

This is my guess based on what I've read.

The larger the lump, the worse the prognosis is.  VERY large lumps reduce the survival stats.  I believe I once read that a 1 centimeter lump has about a billion cells.  I would think that the more cells there are in a lump that the chances increase that some cells could break loose from the lump and travel elsewhere in the body.  Also, a slow-growing tumor may have been there for a long time.

I think it is also based on studies that have been carried out.  It used to be that chemo was recommended for the larger tumors and not the smaller ones, but the standard has changed because they've learned from these studies that there can be metasases with small tumors, too. 

I read that they prefer to ""over treat"" people rather than ""under treat"" because they aren't completely sure who needs chemo and are afraid they might miss some people who might be helped by it.  As a result, lots more people are getting chemo.  Personally, I feel good about using all  available ""tools"" out there as an insurance policy against the cancer recurring.

I'm sure Dr. Leo will elaborate.

Hugs,

							I am just joining. So I guess I will just jump in.
I had a similar experience. I was told that once the tumor gets to a certain size they automatically do chemotherpy.
There is a good treatment decision tool on the ACS site where you fill out your pathology and they tell you what your options are and what is best for you.
Since I was just under (by one milimeter) 2 CMs I thought I could get away with no chemo. But after I took that test I realized it was in my best interest to do the chemo. The doctors had already told me that but I was happy to find out on my own as well.
I believe if you go to ACS> Breast Cancer>Nex-cura Treatment Tool you will find it.

							OK, so different sizes change your stage.  But why does that make a difference re chemo or no chemo?  At 2 cm, I might be I or might be II. I know others in both those stages who didn't have chemo.  So, again, why?  Is it, as penelopez indicates, because of the increased number of cells?
						

"

							DCIS can be invasive.  Because of the ""in situ"" stat, it is stating that it is non invasive, but, there can be micro invasion in the duct.

My thing is that my dcis was 2.5 cm, comedo subtype with extensive necrosis, high nuc grade.  Per the sentinel node, and removal of four nodes, they were all clean.  My fear is the fact that I had to have mastectomies due to the diffuse spread of the cancer.  The area that was biopsied was 2.5 cm, but, the other ones were not biospsied, so I have this fear that they were cancer of the same sort, and that they were related to a different node, which could have been hot.  

I have asked Dr. Leo with no answer yet, and I have to see the onc regarding severe right shoulder, spine and arm pain.  I am so afraid that this is a metastasis and if so, so afraid that it is the aggressive type and that I am going to have a bad prognosis.

							VA Friend,
Have you had a lumpectomy with clean margins or a mastectomy yet?  My ""tumor"" was 2.5 cm, but when they did the mastectomy, there was still more tissue that surrounded the tumor that was cancerous, so my total ""tumor"" was 5.5 cm.  The size of the actual lump doesn't mean that it ended there and very well could be in the tissue, which is included as the ""lump""also.  I've seen more and more ladies with small tumors getting 4 rounds of AC, which is 1/2 the chemo that someone like me with a 5.5 cm got.  I had 6 rounds of 3 different chemos and then 33 rounds of radiation.  Chemo sucks, but it's doable.  I opted for a 2nd mastectomy because I was only 43 when dx and I had Lobular which is prone to mirror itself in the other breast.  I can say though, had I not done that and I got cancer in the other breast, I would take chemo, no doubt about it.  It's really the only chance we have unless you're er/pr+ and then there are drugs you can take daily in hopes of preventing the cancer from coming back.
A friend of mine was stage I, 1.2 cm tumor and had a mastectomy and 4 rounds of chemo.  Even tiny tumors aren't any guarentee and she wanted to do everything possible to beat this disease.

							I'll find out Wednesday what the margins looked like from my lumpectomy.  It was just that my dr was so insistent on chemo before seeing any of that that the size of the tumor based on the mammogram invoked chemo.  I feel like a 5-year-old, asking ""why"", but all I keep hearing is variations of ""because of the size"".   Does the size indicate a greater chance of spread?  Is that what everyone is saying?  Why would it be an indicator of possible spread, even with clean lymph nodes?  Is it because of the number of cancer cells increasing the chance of them cutting loose?  That makes sense, but if that's the case, why won't any medical professionals just SAY that?  Or is it just a decision based on statistics?  If that's the case, why won't any medical professionals just say THAT?

							Hi Dr. Leo.

I have gotten so much mixed information about dcis and spread.  I would like to hear what you have to say.

I was dx on Jan 16 with dcis, high nuc grade 3, comedo subtype with extensive necrosis.  It was est/pro neg.  Everyone from the orig mammo ppl to the surgeon and then the doc and tech who performed the core needle assured me that I was wasting my time, that what I had was not cancer as it was well rounded and space apart.  When it was found to be cancer and such aggressive cancer, the surgeon sent for all my film and was shocked to see the same appearance throughout my breast, very diffuse.  So, lumpectomy was out and I had to have a mastectomy.  Opted for a bilateral due to family history, having had a prior lumpectomy in the other breast (benign) and for symetry as I had a tram flap.  

So, my question is this.  My surgeon did perfom a sentinel node and removed four nodes, all negative.  The sentinel fluid was injected at the site that was biopsied, but, of course not all the others, that were never biopsied to my knowledge.  My concern is if the other areas in my breast were cancerous as well, and their node was not identified, I feel at risk due to the aggressive nature of my cancer.  Also, the area that they identified as cancerous was 2.5 cm and that seems awfully large to me for dcis, and especially dcis that was not palpable.  I am probably spelling these things wrong, I am tired and it is late.

I am worried as now I cannot have a mammo, and have no idea how I would know if there was a recurrance or metastasis.  I have read that with dcis and with my kind of cancer there is a 6-10% chance of recurrance.  

Can you comment to that and also to my concerns with the diffuse areas?

The other thing that I wonder about is the tram flap.  I am not happy with the way that the appearance of it is developing.  My plastics guy put a mesh screen in my lower abdomen, but, my tummy is rounding out more and more and I cannot do anything to stop it.  I have not gained weight, I have lost and I am terrified that if I continue to lose I will look like a freak.  With the ""bundled"" area beneath my reconstructed breasts where the muscles cross, and then this I hate my results.  The ab muscle area, beneath my breasts, is protruding and shows in my clothes.  I wanted the diep so so so badly but, no one in my area performs it.  Do you know if I can have more surgery to fix this and can a tram flap be reversed or changed?  I want my ab muscles back.  I really hate this.

							Hello

Sorry it took me a while to answer your question. Things can get pretty busy here.

Anyway, let me start by stating that when you get a mastectomy, your whole breast is sent to pathology and examined under the microscope. So you would know if there were additional areas involved by cancer. DCIS is just the histological diagnosis, what the pathologist sees under the microscope. Your tumor size is considered a Tis, ""is"" meaning in situ, no positive lymphnodes, which puts you in a very comfortable position. Furthermore, as your entire breast tissue was removed, you do not need mammograms anymore. Your stage is called 0 per current literature.

Let me quote something here from uptodate:




			
				More recently, the natural history of DCIS can be estimated from series of women with DCIS who have undergone BCT rather than mastectomy. Although these studies differ markedly in design, the following general conclusions can be drawn [5,18-31]:

   At 12 to 15 years of follow-up, and regardless of histologic grade or the use of radiation therapy (RT), the majority of women with DCIS treated by breast conserving surgery do not suffer either a local or distant recurrence. Cause-specific survival rates range from 96 to 100 percent.

   Approximately one-half of all recurrences are invasive, regardless of the type of adjuvant therapy (ie, RT, tamoxifen).

   Nearly all patients with a noninvasive recurrence, and a large proportion (>80 percent) of those who recur with invasive breast cancer survive their disease after subsequent treatment (usually mastectomy).
			
		

About the TRAM, sometimes the end-result takes months to achieve. Unfortunately I have no experience with this, as this is not my area, so I can not offer much help :-/.

							I am looking into that procedure now and i live in LI NY.. The problem that i have is that i had 3 c sections and the vessel that he needs for blood supply might have been cut.. Thus i could not have the diep.. where do u live?
						

"
"


							Hi

I am in NC.  I would think that even though you have had the c sections, you could still do any of the procedures.  What they want with the tram is to move the tissue with the muscle still attached to it so that the blood supply is maintained.  I would think that the blood supply is still there, regardless of the prior surgeries.

But, I will say that if I had this to do over, I would have kept hunting til I found a doctor who did the DIEP.  Losing my ab muscles is not a great thing.  The first few months after the tram, everything was all smooth and flat, but, since you do not have muscles to hold that at bay, I began to develop a rounded lower tummy.  And, I did have a mesh screen put in.  That along with the bulge under my breasts make me feel so uncomfortable and like a freak.  With teh DIEP I would have had the tummy tuck and would have my muscles and I would be so so so happy.  As it is not, I just want to cry and wish that I could undo the tram.  It is not so much that it is a horrible surgery, never mind the 8 hours of hell, and as many weeks of recovery, as no one told me that these two things would happen.  Add to that the scarring and so forth, and it makes me sick and hate my body.   I have met a woman whose dr. did hers differently.  He cut her breasts up and down, and only on the bottom part.  She did not lose feeling in her breast and her scars are a zillion times better than mine.  And, her doc used double mesh.  She will probably not have these things happening to her.  It is bad enough to go through all this, but to look so awful to yourself afterwards is hard to take.

Good luck and please email me privately if you want...seeknpeace@aol.com

Did mri to find out that the surface of the bone at the knee was broken in many places. 2 weeks ago her back started hurting.

This did not show on the bone scan 2 months ago. The knee is also not healing. 
The doctor has ordered an mri for the back and the knee.

							Have no medical info/training, but from personal experience over the past 2 years, have you thought of seeing either a rheumatologist and/or a haematologist re your daughter? I wanted to take up a sport (lawn bowls) again after nearly 14 years of not playing, but found that I got a pain in my left hip after standing for just over 5 minutes (a bowls game can require one to be on one's feet up to 3 hours), so saw my GP. She (my GP) referred me to a rheumatologist, who required a chest Xray plus some bloodtests - end result, she (also a female Dr) discovered something in the bloodtests (apart from diagnosing bad osteo-arthritis and severe osteoporosis - none of which I was aware of) and referred me to a haematologist, who diagnosed Myeloma (also known as Multiple Myeloma - a blood cancer which attacks the bone-marrow, which unfortunately, is the place where the blood-cells are manufactured). My Myeloma does not require any treatment, at present, but in February this year, the same rheumatologist discovered another cancer, Squamous Cell Carcinoma, in the upper lobe of my right lung. For me, due to my medical history (have quite severe Ischaemic Heart disease - a triple heart by-pass operation 30+ years ago, which still works - high cholesterol, high blood pressure, etc) both surgery and radiation have been ruled out, so only option for the lung cancer is chemotherapy. In your daughter's case, please ask your doctor to investigate the possibility of Myeloma and/or osteoperosis. Hope you soon find an answer!

When the surgeon came in she was floored that she said this because DCIS does not require chemo.  I aksed her about the pathology report and she said she removed all the tissue.  She explained it to me but  I still don't understand what it says and I was hoping you could help me.

It reads like this:

The deep margin is inked black and the specimen is serially sectioned to reveal an ill defined 5.0x3.5x3.0 cm area of blue stained dense breast parenchyma deep to the nipple extending to wthin .3cm of the deep margin.

This information is under the specimen information where they list the various containers of tissue.  It's not under the diagnoses information.

The diagnoses info reads:

Three foci on intraductal carcinoma (largest focus .5 cm) high grade with comedo necrosis.  Inked deep surgical margin negative for tumor.  

It doesn't say how deep the marhin was though.  Another thing is that I had 3cm of calcifications show up on the mammo.  What happened to the other 2.5 cm?  I looked back on the pathology report from the biopsy and it says they removed 3.0 cm of tiisue and found.4 cm of calcifications.  Could they have removed most of it with the original biopsy?  It was a stereotactic biopsy.

I'm concerned for 2 reasons.  Number one I have a rash on my chest that my dr. says looks like excema.  They biopsied it today at my request because I'm nervous and I'd like to know for sure that it's not cancer.  Number two, when they originally did the pathology from the mastectomy they didn't find any cancer.  My surgeon had them redo it and then they found the three foci of calcifications.  Also, the mastectomy was skin sparring where they only removed the nipple and got the tissue out from there.  I had her remove the biopsy scar too because I understand that cancer can come back in that area.  The other opinion I rec'd was going to cut a line across my chest and I'm wondering if I should have had it done that way so more skin was removed.

Ughhh....I thought I was moving on but this rash has me scared.  The dr. said due to my diagnosis of DCIS he is sure it's not cancer but I'm really nervous about it.

Thanks for your help.

							After re-reading this I guess I should clarify something.  My surgeon was upset at the intern saying the cancer was close to the margins and that I needed chemo because of what the 1st section said...that there was ill defined breast parenchyma deep to the nipple extending to within .3cm of the deep margin.  This is the part I don't understand.  Does this mean cancer was found in this area or is this just decribing the tissue?  The other part said the margins were negative for tumor.

Sorry for the long post and for not making much sense.  I think it's the fear taking me over.

Thanks again to anyone that can help me understand this.

							Hi, Lisa, I am not sure what the path report says, but I am sure Dr. Leo will stop in and help you with the technical words. If you don't understand, I would ask the doctor to explain in simple words. Keep pushing until you do understand. As for chemo or no chemo, treatment options differ. IMHO I don't think that anyone would ever say chemo is NEVER recommended for DCIS. Hugs, Lauri

							Thanks for your response MNLady.  I hope someone can come along and help me with this.  I've never read anything about someone ever getting chemo for DCIS.  The standard treatment is lumpectomy and radiation or mastectomy if necessary.

							Hi Lisa,

Actually, on some of the other boards I've seen a lot of ladies get chemo for DCIS.  It might be based on the fact that some DCIS can be very high grade (comedo,etc.)  Also, some ladies have said that sometimes there can be a chance of a small amount of undetected invasive cancer in there, too.  I think it all depends on what kind of DCIS you have.  I know it is not the same in all people.

Hugs,

Margie

							The only time I've ever read or heard of someone getting chemo for DCIS is if there was also invasive cancer found.  I've studied information on DCIS since my dignoses of 3/04 and never have I seen chemo done for a diagnoses of just DCIS.  If you know of something that mentions this I'd like to see it.
						

"
"


							Nope.  Only what I've read from others on the boards.  I think some are offered chemo as a pecaution, just in case there was a little invasive cancer in there that was not caught.  I myself had invasive ductal.  There is probably overtreatment in this area as well as overtreatment in the area of invasive ductal, for fear of someone not benefiting from all the tools available.  Of course, in the end, it is up to the patient to decide what they want to do.

Good luck.

							I'm newly diagnosed with Dcis.  Here is the Stereotactic biopsy pathologhy report:    Specimen contains a focus of ductal carcinoma in situ, nuclear grade I of III (well differentiated), growing in a micropapillary to cribriform configuration.  Microcalcifications are present within the lesion but no necrosis is observed.  No stromal invasion is found. No invasive malignancy identified.     .  My question is since there's no mass or lump (the microcalcs were found on my first ever screening mammogram),  what determines how much of a ""lump"" has to be removed??  Why do some women with DCIS know the size of their calcifications and then treatment is based on that?  I don't read anywhere on the pathology report how big the calcs were, just that they were microcalcs.

							Hello

The biopsy only confirms the diagnosis. Then you will probably go back for more surgery, and tissue will be removed until clear margins are found.

							Hi,

My wife has IDC, 1cm, grade 1, and has had a lumpectomy and a failed SNB with no aux nodes taken (by her direction). The pathology showed the tumor to have lymphatic/vascular and neurological invasion. She is undergoing all of the imaging and tests right now and we meet with the Oncologist next week to go over everything.

Now I have a question that has just occurred to me.

Everyone says ?Great, you have a slow-growing tumor?, but doesn?t ?slow growing? actually mean that the tumor has been around longer? A fast growing cancer would reach 1cm much quicker than a slow one.

Now since she has this invasion of her various systems, doesn?t that mean that the slow growing tumor has had more time to invade her system? I keep thinking this, but everyone always says that slow growing is better.

Opinions?
						

"
"


							Hi,

I also have a slow-growing tumor and I have wondered about this.

I had my first mammogram after I discovered my lump, so they have no baseline to compare.  As a result, I don't know how long the lump was  there.  But they did advise chemo because of the size of the tumor and probably because it might have been sitting around for a long time.  I would guess that in that regard it would be a ""detriment.""

I am also guessing that if I ever had a recurrence it might be easier to treat it and keep two steps ahead of the tumor growth.  I would think a very fast-growing tumor would be harder to treat.  Of course, this is just my guess.  

It does irk me, though, when people keep saying aggressive vs. non-agressive tumor.  To me, they are ALL aggressive  if they are cancer because it's the same result if it travels to the lungs, liver or brain.  It just might take longer?  

I wish you and your wife the best.

Margie

Any thoughts on this, Dr. Leo?
						

"
"


							Hello

Regardless of how aggressive the tumor is, it is still treated equally. Invasive ductal carcinoma is always treated in an uniform fashion. Considering IDC a slow-growing tumor is ok, but it is relative to other tumors, so it does not really matter, in my mind. We know that it takes several years for a breast cancer to become palpable, and the molecular biology of these tumors can be quite variable, for eg ER/PR and HER2 status.

I finished my treatments 2 years ago for ductal breast cancer.
I was just sent for a lot of tests by my doctor.
He is away so I can't speak to him.
I just got a copy of one of my tests in the mail.
It was a CATSCAN of my abdmin and pelvis.
It says under the ""Impression"" section ""Of Note: Presence of multiple sclerotic foci seen in the left pelvic bones. Clinical correlation is advised""
Does this mean I have cancer in my pelvic bone?!
I can't reach my doctor and I don't know any personally and short of driving to the Emergency Ward and asking one of the doctors there to tell me what this means I have to wait all weekend.

							Hi Martha Anne;

Don't jump to conclusions!!! I am not an expert but some quick research indicated that sclerotic foci are connected with a number of different bone conditions.

Dr. Leo called this suffering by anticipation, I think. It certainly fits.

When my wife was diagnosed and we got the path report, I read it wrong and thought it meant that the interior mammary lymph nodes were positive. This would be critical. It turned out that I had misunderstood the labeling system used to identify the samples.

I also suggest you tell your husband. He will know you are holding something back. He may have trouble holding himself and you together but the two of you are stronger together than apart on this.

That is true, but definitely not always. Out of 9 causes, cancer is only 1 possibility. From what I just read, even vitamin D or floride can cause sclerotic foci.

Just my opinion, but I don't think your onco's office would have given you a copy of your report IF there was anything in there that was bad, like bone mets.  He/she would sit you down and tell you and go over a treatment plan.  On all my tests/scans I have, the last sentence is ""there is no evidence of metastisis (sp) at this time"".  What does the very last thing on your test results say?  If you don't see the word mets or metastatic, then I'd be shocked if it was talking about cancer.
I don't come on the board much, but please e-mail me when you talk to your onco and get an explaination.
I know the waiting is SO hard.

							I recently had the new Cellsearch test for circulating tumor markers.  My result was ""4.""  Based on the research, a score >2 is considered significant.   I was dx'd with 3 types of aggressive breast cancer in 3/01 9 mos. after a supposed normal mammogram at the age of 50 (was still having regular periods at that time).  This included pleomorphic invasive lobular tumor (2.5 cm), a rare presentation of inflammatory b.c. (separate tumor in nipple within dermal lymphatics), and high grade dcis with extensive comedo necrosis.  I had 9 of 12 positive nodes (although first ct scan report stated there appeared to be remaining matted nodes that were not removed--nodes removed were not matted).  I asked the surgeon about that but was given no further clarification or info.   I also had extensive lympho-vascular invasion and extacapsular spread.  My tumor markers were elevated at time of dx--CEA was 13.9 and CA 27-29 was 59.  I was both ER+ as well as Her2+ (+3).  At time of dx I had a punch biopsy which only showed invasive lobular at the time (and was not reported as pleomorphic then).  I had noticed hardened area in upper inner chest--almost above breast 9 mos. before dx, within a day or so after last supposed normal mammogram.  I showed my ob-gyn who was not concerned because mammo had been normal.  (9 mos later I awoke one night to a sudden burning pain in breast (same side that hardened area was).  2 days later that breast began to ache (reminded me of mastitis infection I had 15+ yrs earlier while nursing my youngest child).  10 days after burning pain, I noticed change in nipple.  It started to change daily from time I noticed it--began sinking into aereola.
23 days after biopsy I had a bilateral mastectomy (due to bad family hx of breast cancer and because lobular was type most likely to recur in contralateral breast).  One month after surgery I started chemo--4 AC followed by 5 weeks of radiation and then 4 taxanes (2 Taxol and 2 Taxotere) along with weekly Herceptin (given out-of-protocol based on pathological stage of IIb (although am sure with above that I was more advanced--oncologist later changed it to stage III) for a year.  My first CT scan showed several enlarged retroperitoneal nodes as well as an enlarged aortocaval node and a 1.5 cm lesion in the liver which has gone up to 2 cm.  
I started Arimidex w mos. after last taxane.  6 weeks later I experienced unusual vertigo--told it was benign paroxysmal positional vertigo--have had about 3 to 4 episodes since.  One month after that I had 3 unexplained attacks of acute pancreatitis--each 13 days apart.  One week after last attack all blood levels were normal.  5 weeks later they went 'wacky' and I was dx'd as being hypothyroid.  I started Levothroid and then had hysterctomy.  After hysterectomy I began taking prophylactic doxycycline and Celebrex.  My alkaline phosphatase level was rising and at pt where it was a few pts. from normal, I started prophylactic Zometa--every 3  mos. for osteoporosis prevention.  3 mos. after that I developed sudden, severe sciatic pain during the night--only when lying down.  An MRI showed a cyst or mass in lumbar spine.  MRI showed something small on my neck as well.   3 mos. later lumbar spine mass/cyst was stable.  However, I developed sudden severe shoulder pain.  I increased Celebrex to 800 mg/day and also began statin drug (cholesterol went bad after I started Arimidex--even though I was eating good, low fat diet, exercising, and lost wt--before wt loss and chemo, cholesterol had been normal).  Shoulder x-rays showed bone spur.  
Also, soon after surgery (mastectomy) I developed mild lymphedema.  I was receiving treatment--wrapping, massage, custom day and custom night sleeves but lymphedema suddenly worsened last December.  The month before a bone scan was done.  After procedure, tech stated on own initiative that I had unusual hot spots--and pt'd to shoulder that hurt as well as lower back (area of cyst or mass).  Bone scan report made no mention of anything about shoulder but did state that area in lower back was 'stable.'  In addition to worsening lymphedema, chest area below shoulder that hurt (on non malignant side) became swollen.  3 dr's told me I had swollen axillary node(s) under arm of non-malignant side.  My back on malignant side reddened in one area along with worsening lymphedema.  After the mastectomy there was a deep pit in underarm on side lymph nodes had been removed from.  When I noticed increased lymphdema, I noticed swelling in armpit where the deep pit had been.  My oncologist mumbled something about a chest wall recurrence and sent me to the surgeon.  My surgeon said it was lymphdema.  Later, when I again told surgeon about lumpiness in armpit of side where malignancy was, she said no further surgery could be done because it wouldn't heal. 
Then in July I started having discomfort in my neck.  I was told by a neurologist that there was a lesion there (C2).  I also am supposedly having worsening of disk degeneration in the C6/C7 area.  In addition shoulder pain has extended to other arm--malignant side.  New bone scn (last June) reported increased shoulder uptake in arm of malignant side was 'stable' even though previous bone scan made no mention of anything going on in shoulder (even though I had pain and tech pointed out 'unusual hot spots' -- her words.
I asked my oncologist how one differentiated between bone metastases and arthritic activity.  He did not answer my question.  Instead he said that it didn't matter in terms of long term survival if one treated metastases for 3 years or waited a year and treated for 2 years.
We went for a 2nd opinion last June at a major teaching hospital and were told that no opinion would be given until a diagnosis had been made by the treating oncologist (which is through a non-profit HMO) even though we sought this 2nd evaluation on our own and were paying out-of-pocket.
In addition I have several lesions on an MRI of the brain.  No diagosis of metastases has been made but since increase in Celebrex and start of statin drug they have become smaller.  Symptoms include 3 or 4  episodes of dizziness---longest lasted 6 hours.   I have also had an on-going hissing sound in both ears--for 15 mos--which did not go away after taking 3.5 week break from Celebrex.
I should also mention that I have otosclerosis--dx'd 33 years ago, and I was also dx'd with multiple sclerosis at age 21.  The M.S. worsened until I began taking betaseron (interferon beta 10 yrs ago) and since then has been stable.  However, my neurologist thought that the chemo may have cured it or put that into remission.
Anyway, I am currently concerned about the results of the Cellsearch test and what may be going on.  Reports of scans, despite descriptions of activity and symptoms are not stating anything of significant concern.  I am a bit confused.  I want to know whether I do or don't have metastases.  Whenever I go for symptom-related difficulty I am bounced around amongst different specialists--none being committal.  One example for my shoulder pain--was sent to physical therapist (who recommended shoulder strengthening even though I was working out and doing that), a regular dr. (who recommended cortisone injections--which didn't help), regular dr. sent me to an orthopedist who ordered an MRI (report came back saying it could be rheumatoid arthritis even though I had none of the symptoms, other than pain, that went with that.  Orthopedist did not think it was rheumatoid arthritis--said he thought it was in my neck.  I asked if he would be discussing that with my regular dr (who referred me to him) and he said ""no"" because regular dr. referred me for my neck (their offices are even in same bldg).  So, I spoke with my regular dr. about what orthopedist said and my regular dr. referred me to a rheumatologist.  The rheumatologist could not believe what I had been through and said the most important concern was whether the cancer was back and she referred me for additional tests.  Radiology did not want to do the tests she ordered and wanted to do something less intensive than the original MRI I had  even though she talked with them.  I went to membership services and the additional tests were done but were done in  such a way that adequate comparisons could not be made and one of the areas of concern (lymph nodes felt to be swollen by 3 dr's were not adequately imaged--learned that after another mri was done several mos. later and stated that the other mri didn't image them so that they could adequately be seen or compared).  Anyway, during time rheumatologist was trying to figure out what was going on she heard from my oncologist.  She then called me and said she could not order any further tests because she didn't know how to interpret them.  Huh???   I did see another oncologist for a 2nd opinion and he hemmed and hawed when I told him what other dr's had commented about chest wall recurrence.  He said that treatment of metasatases was expensive and involved 'paperwork' and 'change(s)' but did not further elaborate.
I am petrified that something is going on and is not going to be identified until the only treatment left is palliative, band-aid treatment that might allow me to survive the 'standard' time given after mets is dx'd--2 to 3 years.  Now, with the results of the cell search test (""4"" where anything >2 is significant), what can be done and where might I go to get an honest 2nd opinion.  My thoughts are that I may have to go out-of-state.
One thing I learned--we did have another recent MRI done of spine--showed worsening of cervical spine but lumbar spine was 'okay' based on imaging techniques used.  I was told by director that they are required to adhere to medicare standards--since all have to be treated 'equally'  Interestingly, the previous Mri of my thoracic spine was done by a tech who was moonlighting when hmo tech was on vacation.  After I was done I commented that it seemed to take longer than usual.  He said that was because if he sees anything he takes extra films--that was considered ""best practice"".  When I later got copy of report and films, there were 17 films instead of usual 8.  He had said he did a spect scan (or stir?).  There was reported uptake but that scan was not compared with previous scans.  Spine dr. to whom I had been sent by oncologist for cyst or mass in lumbar spine said it appeared as if there were bone marrow mets in all the vertebrae of my thoracic spine.  Subseqent mri of thoracic spine was done on different settings (to conform with medicare standards--which I think are less intensive than what had been on previous scan).  When I heard that--it brought to mind something oncologist had originally told me--that better monitoring was done for those in a clinical trial.  Now I think I understand what he meant.   Meanwhile, I have no idea what is going on--but do know that I am at extremely high risk for metastases an d a short relapse free survival time, supposedly.  
So, now that I have cellsearch test results--what might they mean?  Can they be elevated for bone mets only? Or???

							Hello

Unfortunately I have no experience with this new test. Also, given that your presentation is so complex, it would be irresponsible of me to try to say if you have metastases or not. I read the research with Cellsearch, but can not say what your results mean.

regards,

							Results of using the CellSearch System indicate that monitoring of circulating tumor cells (CTC's) can contribute to the understanding of tumor-blood interactions and may provide a valuable tool for therapy monitoring in solid tumors like breast, colorectal or prostate cancer. With cells being alive in circulation, it may mean that a patient would need additional treatment. 

These ciculating tumor cells can detach from solid tumors and enter the blood stream, thus beginning the process of metastasis, the most life-threatening aspect of cancer. To metastasize, or spread cancer to other sites in the body, circulating tumor cells travel through the blood and can take root in another tissue or organ (like the lungs, bones, liver, adrenals and even the brain). 

Immunicon's founder/scientist (immunologist) Paul Liberti's Immunicon team developed all the technology to help researchers and oncologists monitor CTC's. Immunicon licensed their technology to Johnson & Johnson who formed a new unit called Veridex to market Immunicon's CellSearch technology. The technology gives the patient and oncology community a great method to monitor treatment. 

The CellSearch system can be very complimentary to an array of tools that oncologists should be using to counsel their patients. The only problem with this method is that the patient may receive potentially toxic and ineffective drugs before circulating tumor cells are measured. The CellSearch System could be utilized for confirmation after being administered the assay-directed most beneficial therapeutic agents. 

The CellSearch technique can be done earlier than other currently approved diagnostic modalities like CT, MRI or PET imaging. However, you are measuring the drug effects on tumors ""in"" the patient, one treatment at a time. The outcome for metabolic responders and non-responders with imaging and the CellSearch System is basically what is going on with a ""functional"" profiling assay, showing what patients are benefiting from what drug agents, ""before"" introducing them into the patient. 

Anti-cancer treatments often effectively shrink the size of tumors, but some might have an opposite effect, actually expanding the small population of cancer stem cells believed to drive the disease. Some treatments could be producing more cancer stem cells which are then capable of metastasizing, because these cells are trying to find a way to survive the therapy. The tumor escapes from chemotherapy by induction of stem cell marker expression. The small number of cells that survive the treatment could then generate another tumor that metastasizes. 

This may help explain why the expression of stem cell markers has been associated with resistance to chemotherapy and radiation treatments and poor outcome for patients with cancers including prostate, breast and lung cancers. That tells us that understanding how to target these markers and these cells could prove useful in treating these cancers. 

Analysis of stem cell expression before and after treatment reveals that even as some anti-cancer treatments shrank tumors, they increased expression of stem cell markers like Nanog and BMI1 (both of which contibute to stem cells' defining ability to renew themselves and differentiate into different cell types). Some treatments are not enough to completely inhibit tumor growth, and the cancer stem cell markers are still present. 

Even if one or more chemotherapy regimen is identified as being likely to work on a particular cancer, has the science advanced to tell us whether application of the chosen chemotherapy regimen will not cause other changes that also cause cancer to later return and perhaps be even harder to treat? Is it a case of chemotherapy being bad, in cases where it apparently works? Chemotherapy can be mutagenic (changes in form). It might kill off a whole lot of cancer, only to cause a mutation in the remaining cancer, such that the remaining cancer behaves in a more aggressive fashion. 

Much more work needs to be done, and oncologists need to adapt treatment to the patient. There are hundreds of chemotherapeutic agents, all of which have approximately the same probability of working. The tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. It requires individualized treatment based on testing individual properties of each patient's cancer.

Are Stem Cells the root of the problem?

Stem cells have that infinite ability to renew themselves and produce the many different cell types that make up a human. Cancer's hallmark is its ability to grow infinitely, multiplying into various cells that make up a tumor. Is cancer the result of a normal stem cell turned bad or an ordinary cell that somehow acquires a stem cell's immortality and versatility?

A recent finding that Temodar (temozolomide) increased the number of cancer cells with stem-like characteristics sounds eerily similar to the increase in the number of metabolic activity of mitochondria of the surviving cells from taxane (Taxol) therapy, even in cases where the majority of the cells are being killed by taxanes. It may indeed give clinical response (tumor shrinkage), however, these are mostly short-lived and relapses after a reponse to taxanes are often dramatic.

In stem cell research, anti-cancer treatments often effectively shrink the size of tumors, but some might have the opposite effect, actually expanding the small population of cancer stem cells that then are capable of metastasizing. Using the CellSearch System technique that quantifies circulating tumor cells, scientists had shown that chemotherapy with Taxol causes a massive release of cells into the circulation, while at the same time reducing the size of the tumor, explaining that complete pathologic responses do not correlate well with improvements in survival.

Circulating tumor cells (CTCs) are cancer cells that have detached from solid tumors and entered the blood stream. This can begin the process of metastasis, the most life-threatening aspect of cancer. To metastasize, or spread cancer to other sites in the body, CTCs travel through the blood and can take root in another tissue or organ.

Even before the advent of the CellSearch technique, it had been observed in Cell Function Analysis that there was an increase in the number of metabolic activity of mitochondria of the surviving cells from Taxol therapy, even in cases where the majority of the cells were being killed by Taxol.

This new research hightens the faults of gene amplificaton/mutation studies. Genetic profiling assumes that all drugs within a class will produce precisely the same effect, even though from clinical experience, this is not the case. Nor can genetic profiling tell anything about drug combinations.

Are you sure that you've identified every single protein that might influence sensitivity or resistance to drugs? The ""cell"" is a system, an integrated, interacting network of genes, proteins and other cellular constituents that produce functions. You need to analyze the systems' response to drug treatments, not theoretical predispositions.

Cancer is a complex disease and needs to be attacked on many fronts. Cellular profiling holds the key to solving some of the problems confronting the critical task of matching individual patients with the treatments most likely to benefit them.

Dr. Katharina Pachmann was the investigator who reported at an annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium in 2004, using the CTC technique, German investigators showing that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel (taxol) causes a massive release of cells into the circulation, while at the same time reducing the size of the tumor. The finding helped to explain the fact that complete pathologic responses do not correlate well with improvements in survival (Oncol News Int'l, Vol 14, #5, May '05).

Two years before this, Dr. Christos Kosmas, published a study ""Carcinomatous Meningits: Taxane-Induced"" which found what is called ""dissemination after taxane-based (taxol) chemotherapy. the study concluded that Carcinomatous Meningitis (a CNS metastasis) after a major response to front-line taxane-based regimens represents a grave disease manifestation and its incidence appears increased when compared retrospectivley to non-taxane-treated patients (American Journal Clinical Oncology 2002;63:6-15).

Monitoring CTCs could be utilized for confirmation after the patient is administered assay-directed most beneficial therapeutic agents.

Does anyone have any suggestions to help with post mastectomy scar pain?  My mom had a full mastectomy about 7 years ago (yea!), but still experiences periodic pain near the scar area.  It's more like an extreme tightness.  At the time of her surgery so long ago, no one gave her any information about anything other than suggesting the mastectomy!   Reconstructive surgery was not even discussed!

If anyone has any suggestions, even well-known suggestions, please offer them to someone who is uninformed about what's out there.....

							This is the first time I am posting to any website; I really need to talk to someone. The last 15 months for me have been hell. I am 42 years old. In July 2003 my mammogram showed microcalcifications in the left breast. I had a sterotactic biopsy in August 2003. The sterotactic showed atypical ductal hyperplasia, so I had a needle localization biopsy of the left breast in September 2003. The excisional biopsy showed Proliferative fibrocystic changes including radial scar with florid and focal atypical ductal epithelial hyperplasia. My local hospital sent the slides to the Mayo clinic who said ""They consider the findings diagnostic of atypical ductal hyperplasia and agree that they fall short of those required for a confident diagnosis of DCIS (Ductal Carcinoma In situ). I wasn't very re-assured by the statement that the findings simply fell short of a confident diagnosis of cancer. I was referred to an oncologist and went on Tamoxifen right away. I was scheduled for a follow-up mammogram in 6 months. One month before my scheduled follow-up, I found a lump in my right breast. I had the mammogram and it didn't show anything, but the lump was there and could be felt by my surgeon. He recommended another excisional biopsy which I had done in March 2004. The biopsy showed focal intraductal epithelial hyuperplasia and sclerosing adenosis, ductal ectasia and cystic change - no malignancy or atypia. I went to a breast care center (surgical oncologist) for a second opinion and they concurred, recommending another 6 month follow-up with mammogram. Again, about one month before my scheduled mammogram, I found another lump in the right breast (same area as previous lump). The surgical oncologist did an ultrasound and identified a solid mass and recommended another biopsy. Three days before surgery, I found another lump right next to the one being removed. On October 18, 2004 I had my fourth biopsy on both lumps. The results were again a very close call, showing sclerosing and blunt duct adenosis with radial scar and focal atypical ductal hyperplasia, but not enough to call it DCIS. The surgeon recommended an MRI which I had this last Tuesday. The MRI was inconclusive. It showed numerous small scattered foci of enhancement diffusely distributed throughout both breasts. The areas are too small to characterize accurately. the MRI report goes on to say that these are most likely benign, but DCIS and LCIS cannot be excluded. My surgeon said that since the MRI is inconclusive, he would recommend a 6 month follow-up MRI. He also volunteered to send my latest biopsy out for a second opinion to the country's expert on breast cancer. so now I am waiting for the expert's opinion. I am very thankful that so far, no cancer has been diagnosed, but I feel like I have a time bomb waiting to go off in my chest. I am so tired of dealing with multiple surgeries and biopsies, and each one takes its toll on me psychologically and physically. I have had 4 biopsies in 13 months! I am considering having a prophylactic bilateral mastectomy. My surgeon is checking to see if my insurance would cover this procedure since no cancer has yet been found. Also, there is no history of BC in my family. If the expert comes back and says it is DCIS, my surgeon recommends that I have the bilateral mastectomy because there is so much atypia in both of my breasts. I know this sounds terrible, but I am hoping the expert says it is DCIS. I don't think I can face another biopsy. The lumps keep appearing so fast, I am doing a breast self exam nearly every week (sometimes every day). I am scared and confused and tired. SInce I don't technically have breast cancer, I don't feel like I can join a suppport group, but I need someone to talk to. My husband is trying to understand, but all he keeps saying is thank God it isn't cancer, don't worry. It is impossible not to worry. I know it is just a matter of time before I find another lump, and have to go through this again (my last biopsy showed tht the ADH involves posterior margin, meaning they didn't get all of it out, I think). Am I over reacting? I am having toruble sleeping, I can't get all this out of my mind. I would appreciate hearing from anyone who can relate. Thanks.

							Hi Karin,

I don't have any advice for you.  I just wanted to offer you some support.  You've been through an extremely stressful time and you are not overreacting.  I don't blame you for wanting some good answers to your questions.  I  mean, 4 biopsies in 13 months......that's a LOT to endure!  You're tired of lumps popping up all the time and you're living with the fear that eventually you will get a BC diagnosis.

Karin, you don't have to have BC to join one of the BC support groups.  The ladies in these groups would welcome you to discuss your fears and get some good information, too.  They've all been there/done that.  One of them is www.breastcancer.org    and another is  http://messageboards.ivillage.com/iv-bhbreast  Don't be shy - come on over!

I'm sure Dr. Leo will have some info when he gets here.  In the meantime, know that we are all here for you.

							Margie,

Thanks for the support and the hugs  . You're right, I am thinking that a diagnosis of BC is inevitable, just a matter of time, based on my history. My surgeon said my lifetime risk of BC at this point is 40%, a little too high for my comfort, but at least I am staying on top of things, so that if this does become cancer, it will be caught early and will be cured. Thanks also for the links to the online support groups, I will definitely stop in. I think it is great that these types of forums exist, I am certainly finding comfort in just talking to others.

							HI Margie,
I'm not a doc, but I have to agree that a BC dx is more then likely going to happen.  The surgeon knows you have ""dseased"" breasts and I'm sure insurance would pay for you to have a double mastectomy.  My nightmare started when I had just turned 43.  In my case, there was no doubt.  The mammogram missed a 5.5 cm tumor and my ultrasound was misread, but I was in a little rinky dink city then.  I came back to where I'm living again and saw a surgeon and I was Stage III and 9+/16 nodes involved.  I wanted the other breast removed also, just didn't want to take a chance of it going to the other breast and I had no problem getting that approved by the insurance company.  I'd have a heart to heart with your surgeon or have him refer you to an oncologist about having them removed now before it is cancer and then you have to go through treatments.
I don't get on here much, so please e-mail me and let me know how things are going.
Prayers to you and this long waiting period you've had to endure.  Waiting is so hard

							Hello

Thanks for sharing your story with us. I hope we can be of help. About your problem(s), I think there is no question that your breast tissue tends to be abnormal, given several areas of atypia. There is no question that atypia is just a step away from cancer itself. I am sorry I can make no firm recommendations, but one of these areas will probably evolve to breast cancer if left alone. As someone mentioned above, please do talk to your doctor about this. Another thing you can do is to see a geneticist, so he/she can estimate your risk of developing BC, and his/her opinion will be very valuable if you would like to have a bilateral mastectomy, and your insurance will porbably do it with a geneticist's opinion.

good luck and please feel free to post here !

							Karen,
You sound like me!  I have a VERY similar experience.  Mine included the same pathology results as well as a diagnosis of LCIS.  I had 6 biopsies in 15 months; 2 excisional, 3 core and one FNA.  Another concern expressed by my radiologist was that I had very dense breasts and mamograms were very difficult to read. (anotherwords not 100% foolproof)  It seems as though with every mamogram, ultrasound. clinical exam or self exam; something new popped up without fail.  I feel your pain and if you feel crary and scared, you earned the right to be!  There is so much support out there for those poor souls who are diagnosed with a full blown cancer, (Lord knows they need it) but for those of us who believe we are waiting for the other shoe to drop, it sometimes feels as though we are left to twist in the wind. I wished that I could have found an ""It's Almost Cancer"" support group.  Silly as that may sound, there are more and more people out there who will find themselves in our rocky shoes because of what we are finding out about genetic predispositions!

That aside, my surgeon from the get go always brought up the subject of mastectomy.  Initially, I though he was a little aggressive in our conversations, but I eventually took him up on the offer.  In addition to the problems mentioned above, ovarian cancer runs in my family, it was recommended by a genetic counselor that I have the test for the BRCA gene as they determined that I had a 23% chance of having a mutation. I also was on tamoxifin for about 1year after my LCIS diagnosis and continued to need biopsies becasue of abnormal findings despite the medication.  Sadly, the clincher for pushing me towrd choosing mastectomy was that my health insurance via COBRA was running out.  I was unable to secure new medical insurance because of my history.  As a 43 year old mom of 4 young children, I realized that we could not take on the burden of out of pocket expenses for a ""biopsy-of-the-month"" or a subsequent cancer diagnosis & treatment.  My post prophelactic bilateral mastectomy pathology report revealed a previously undetected 2.8 cm high grade tumor of DCIS. 

I don't mean to blather on about myself, but I think that it might be a relief (in some fashion) to hear a similar story.  It is FRUSTRATING to comb through general literature and personal accounts and NEVER being able to find something that you can relate to. I hope this helps.  If you are curious about how I feel about my decision, I am SO happy with where I am  now.  It is great to be rid of that endless torture of yet another lump, test or whatever; I always wondered what was being missed.

I have a wonderful supprt team of doctors who I found to be just what I needed to assist in my decisions.  I am confident that you will be able to accomplish this too! Just know that while you languish in this gray area, the ultimate decision about what action to take will have to come from you.

Best wishes & continued strength
PS.  For those folks who think you should stop worrying, get on with it and say ""Just thank God it isn't cancer""; don't get it.  Please do not let them frustrate you or make you feel badly about your emotions; they have NO IDEA how toruted you can feel.  Find a sensitive friend or professinal that you can talk to, it will help!

							Leo,

Thanks for your reply. I am doing my best to stay on top of things, and I am very comfortable with my new doctors. Quick question, would they consider genetic counseling for me since I have no family history of breast or other cancer? My family history is somewhat limited in that my mom was severly disabled with emphysema and stopped getting mammograms at about age 55, and her younger sister died from emphysema at age 55, and I have no sisters, so there are not too many females to consider. I do have one surviving maternal aunt, who has never had any sign of breat cancer. I thought genetic testing was only offered to those with a strong family history? 

ps
I heard yesterday that my insurance will cover a simple mastectomy, as long as my surgeon says it is medically necessary, so now I have a really big decision to make.

							Hi Karen,

Hoping you're feeling a little better by talking to others.

Here is a great site for women who are concerned there MAY be a genetic link for BC in their family.  It's also for women who think there MAY be a genetic predisposition.  www.facingourrisk.org  The woman who started it was dx at age 31 and frequently posts at www.breastcancer.org under the ""high risk"" thread.  Here is some info. about it:


Here is a little about the site: 

FORCE is a nonprofit organization for women who are at high risk of getting these cancers due to their family history and genetic status, and for members of families in which a BRCA mutation may be present. Our web site can be a helpful resource for anyone who knows she is at risk, who wonders whether she might be at risk, or who cares about the issues and concerns that we face. 

Good luck and let us know how it goes!

							Hi,
I posted a few weeks ago under the subject ""Tired and Scared"". At that time my surgeon had decided to send my slides out to what he called the country's expert (Dr. Page at Vanderbilt Medical Center) for a second opinion. He sent all the slides from all my previous biopsies (4 in total). I just got a call yesterday from my surgeon that he got the report from Vanderbilt and that the news is very good - no cancer. He went on to say that the report concludes that no atypical cells were seen by Vanderbilt in any of the pathology slides, and he would recommend that I discontinue my Tamoxifen. The part that I am confused about is that I had three previous biopsies that were reviewed by three different labs (my local hospital, the Mayo Clinic and my new hospital), and all concluded there was focal and florid atypia in both the left and right breast biopsies, so much so that they had to rule out DCIS because it was such a close call (it took over two weeks to diagnose this was just atypia and not DCIS for 2 of my biopsies). Now the expert is saying that there is no atypia at all and now my doctor wants me off Tamoxifen. I don't understand how four different labs could look at the same slides and come up with such different conclusions. I am going to call my doctor on Monday to discuss, but who do I believe? Of course I want to believe the expert, but I feel like I am betting my life on just one doctor's opinion. If I go off Tamoxifen and he is wrong, then my chances of BC shoot up to over 65%, based on my previous history. Who's opinion do I believe at this point? I did question my local hospital's findings when all this started, simply because they do not specialize in breast cancer, and they sent my slides to the Mayo Clinic who agreed with their diagnosis (I would think the Mayo Clinic is considered an expert as well). So, the question is, now what do I do? Do I stay on Tamoxifen, even though I may not need it, or do I discontinue it and take the chance that the expert is right?

							Hi,
I am very concerned about my Wife. I first noticed a persistent cough last February, and it has been getting steadily worse since.  I first noticed it during the day, but she usually coughs first thing in the morning. She is 59 years old, a 40 pack-year smoker. For the first 6 months, it was just during the day, but starting in August, she was also coughing at night. It appears to me to be a non-productive cough, as I have never seen her swallow after a coughing fit. Now the coughing fits occur every 20 min, or so during a bad day, but after a few days this will subside to once an hour or more, on a less severe day. She does regular clearing of her throat, but this is much like my own. (I believe I have sub-clinical chronic bronchitis). I have not noticed any significant shortness of breath, nor wheezing. Also she is a late onset insulin-dependant diabetic. She will absolutely not go to the doctor, as I believe she suffers from a classic neurosis regarding cancer, and death, stemming form a childhood incident regarding a step-grandmother who died of cancer in the home.

 I have done a lot of reading on the net, and here are my thoughts, which I present for your comments.
1.	It does not present like chronic bronchitis, since it did not appear seasonally, as a lingering cough from a cold, gradually increasing in duration until it lasted for 3 months of more in at least two successive years.
2.	It did not present like emphysema, for which I read the first symptoms are usually shortness of breath, and wheezing, followed by a cough in the later stages.
3.	Likewise, It does not present like asthma
4.	My Son has GERD and this is also different, being a productive cough, and associated with heartburn (though I read this is not always a symptom) It seems unlikely to me that she would suddenly develop GERD at 59, but I don?t really know.
5.	I guess it could be caused by post-nasal drip, but would this account for the progression in severity of her cough? She has no obvious sinusitis.
6.	She has no other symptoms that might suggest congestive heart failure.
7.	I thought TB as unlikely, based on local occurance, and likelihood of contact
8.	I guess it could be cystic fibrosis, but I know very little about this.
9.	I know there are quite a few other possibilities, such as sarcoidosis, bronchiectasis, thoracic enurism, etc, but I guess these are less likely than Cancer
10.	It seems to me that the cause is most likely lung cancer. She has not complained of chest pains, and has not reported to me any hemoptsis. She has lost no noticable weight, and seems to be eating normally. She does occasionally complain of a headache in the upper neck, but this could be due to stress. I have noticed very recently a very slight change in her mental state, (momentary confusion, uncharacteristic lack of reason), but this is very slight, and could be due to stress (she recently lost her father, and our newborn grandson is blind), rather than a metastatic tumor.

I am a person for whom security is based on knowledge and understanding, and I realize I am grasping at straws, and that even doctors, relying on multiple tests, may be uncertain of the exact cause of chronic cough, and must experiment. 
Is there any validity to me reasoning?
Thanks,
John

							I am afraid that this is a case where your wife needs to be checked out by a doctor if you can convince her to go. If she is not being terribly inconvenienced by her cough, it may just be an annoying allergy or irritation. However, 40 years of smoking cigarettes is enough reason to be coughing. Get her to see the doctor if you can.

							I was diagnosed with cancer in Feb 04 and had a LWE 2 weeks later.  When I went back for my results, I was told that I had to have a mastectomy, chemo and radiotheraphy because I had Grade 3 multi-focal invasive ductal cancer and although they had removed the tumor (3.2cm) they didn't think they had got all the cancer.  There was also lymph node involvement.

After discussions with Plastic Surgeon, it was decided to do mastectomy, lymph node clearance and reconstruction (tram flap) at the same time.  I had initial operation on 2 Apr, another on 3 Apr and then on 17 Apr reconstruction was removed due to infection.  I spend a total of 30 days in hospital because I also managed to pick up MRSA!  The pathology report from mastectomy was a surprise as it showed I had extensive widespread invasive lobular cancer (one 2cm tumor, a couple at 1.?, and another four or so at 0.?mm - I can't remember exactly how many or size) which nobody knew was there!  It also showed that some lymph nodes had been infected and one had grown a tumor - although I don't understand the differance and would appreciate any info about this.

Next week I am having my last cycle of chemo, taking December off from treatments and having radiotheraphy in January.  I have talked to my ongologist about having a mastectomy on the other side as lobular cancer tends to come on both sides and I have multiple cysts on that side.  He advised me that I could still get primary cancer on that side and made no comment when I asked if it would reduce the risks.  I got the distinct impression that it was felt that there was a good chance that I would be back with more cancer.

I have been positive and have not let cancer rule my life although it sometimes feels as though I live at the hospital and have worked the whole way through and taken the minimum time off work.  I am still working a little from home although technically on sick leave as I have been admitted to hospital 3 times recently and spent most of October in hospital.  Now I'm in a quandary about whether or not to have a mastectomy on the other side and medically it seems that the jury is still out.  Has anyone faced a similar problem?

							HI,
I was dx Stage III, Invasive Lobular BC 2/14/02.  I had a MRM and the tumor was 5.5cm and I had 9 positive nodes out of 16.  May of last year, I opted for a 2nd mastectomy, which my surgeon is total agreement and my onco saying that it would improve my odds of it not coming back.  There are sure  no guarentees with this crappy disease, but Lobular IS prone to mirror itself in the other breast and with the large tumor and positive nodes, it was even more likely to mirror itself.  I wasn't going to wait to see if it went to the other breast, so I'm not boobless, but very much alive 
If I can help since I've been there and done that, please e-mail anytime. My e-mail addy should be listed on my profile, but if not, add an 04 to this screenname and that's me

							My situation is somewhat similar to what you describe.  I also was diagnosed initially with multifocal infiltrating ductal (a little ahead of you - in Jan 04).  had a mast. in Feb. and the pathology report came back with infiltrating lobular as well as some small areas of DCIS.  I was very surprised - and a little disconcerted to think that all that was going on unknown...I have encountered a few others who had this experience - but not that many.  I have also been questioning doing a prophylactic on my good side - but haven't made the decision yet.  I finished chemo (dose dense AC and Taxol) in June, then did radiation over the summer.  Just had my tissue expander exchanged out for a silicone implant.  it is hard to contemplate having yet another surgery - but i'm curious to see Dr. Leo's response to this issue.  best of luck,  Cathy

							Hello

Multi-focal IDC means that several *independent* areas of IDC were found. That already shows that your tissue tends to progress to cancer. In your case a bilateral mastectomy would probably be beneficial. 

Let me quote something from uptodate:




			
				The comparative efficacy of a program of careful observation versus prophylactic mastectomy in a population of high-risk women is uncertain. One meta-analysis included 389 women with LCIS who were followed for a mean of 10.9 years after excision: 16.4 percent developed invasive carcinoma, and the breast cancer mortality rate was 2.8 percent [38]. There was a nonsignificant trend toward a lower breast cancer mortality rate (0.9 percent) among 391 women who were treated initially with prophylactic mastectomy.
			
		

The study above was only with removal of the area of LCIS. Your case is beyond that, with transformation into IDC.

							Hello, Fan,
My initial diagnosis was ILC in the left breast.  I opted for a mastectomy and the path report revealed LCIS as well.  I battled through two years of ""careful observation"" of the other breast, which involved way-too-frequent mammos, ultrasounds, and surgical biopsies (and all the scary throughts that go with that).  In the end I just felt thoroughly beat up and I opted for a prophylactic mastectomy on the right breast.  The path report came back with two areas of LCIS that we had no idea were there.

Can't say I love being breastless, but I sure do love the reassurance of knowing I've done all I can to promote my best health.  The prospect of no more mammos is a mighty nice side benefit.

I wish you real peace with whatever decision you make,

							I couldn't have said it better.  I did the same thing as you and I know I've done everything possible by having both breasts removed.  It's been almost 3 years and so far so good.  It just wasn't worth keeping the breast with Lobular and bieng ""young"" and Stage III.  The left breast is the one I had the MRM on and node disection.  When they removed the other breast last year, there was no cancer, thank God, but I felt like I was a sitting duck.  That black cloud hanging over our heads is bad enough and I wanted to do everything possible.  I won't put myself through a Tram Flap, which is my only option due to radiation, so I guess I'll just take my boobs off every night before going to bed   They have so many kinds of prothesis now, they look natural under clothes.
I know you'll make the right decision for you.

							Many thanks for all your replies which have really helped me and made me feel less paranoid.  I have more or less made up my mind to have a mastectomy on the other side and your comments have made it even firmer.  I have a consultation with my Plastic Surgeons on 20 December when I will find out my ongologist's comments to them about a second mastectomy, which could be very revealing, and then I will make my final decision.

							I was diagnosed over 2 years ago with squamous cell carcinoma of the tonsil with lymph node metastasis, stage 4b. I underwent a modified neck dissection, radiation and chemo. I have had clear scans, however in the last 2 months, I have had a feeling of something stuck in my throat on the left side( that is where my cancer originated). I have some referred ear pain, however not constant, as well as tingling around my mouth and chin. My throat does not hurt to swallow, however it does feel irritated, like a burning sensation, but mostly on the left side. I saw my ent/surgeon in october, and he gave me a full exam, stating everything looked good. He said something about gerd and to start taking zantac ( I do have constant heartburn for which I am taking tums). He also said something about scar tissue. I had a chest xray in july which was all clear, but I feel he is reluctant to scan me because I am 7 months pregnant :d . I will be having a ct in january after the baby is born, but I cant help feeling like the cancer is back. It is consuming me. I just want the rest of my pregnancy to be stress free. I'm sure I can insist on a scan, but if it has recurred, what are my options. Any advice? Anybody have similar symptoms? Any words of wisdom would be greatly appreciated.

							Hello

As you pointed out, it is a problem to get a CT scan when you are pregnant. One thing that can happen is scarring and problems related to the radiation that you received. But you certainly need to have a repeat CT scan, after you deliver.

Not having seen your child it is hard to say what it is. But a common thing with newborns are hemangiomas, which really are these large dark areas. Most of them go away with time. But this is just a possibility. You should take her to be examined by a Dr.

Take your child to a pdiatrician or pediatric surgeon. According to your discription its looking like more of nevus, a benign entity.But you will have to confirm it & keep a close watch over it.

							It probably is a nevus. Skin disorders are to be examined and no diagnosis can be made without having a clear look at the lesion. 

Lesions cannot be explained easily. So its best to be examined by a doctor preferably a skin specialist.

							My grandmother had breast cancer, she had three daughters. One died of breast cancer, one had cancer and had to have both breasts removed, and the third and youngest does not have breast cancer, the third is my mother. I am 22 and am very afraid that I have a huge risk. I was wondering what steps I should be taking right away if any?

There is a government program, that someone will have to tell you the name of, maybe the health department where you live, that says every  woman, either 39 or 40 (I read it at the hospital when I was having my biopsy) regardless of insurance will recieve a mammogram and pap/pelvic once a year.  You might want to call your health dept. and ask about that bill.  Explain your situation and it might apply to you, but if you have no problems, like a lump, I don't know if it would.  It's worth a try though.
Wish I could be more help.

							Hi,

If you are worried about a genetic link, here is a website you might want to peruse.  It is very helpful, started by a woman who was diagnosed with BC at 31.  www.facingourrisk.org

Here is a little about the site:

FORCE is a nonprofit organization for women who are at high risk of getting these cancers due to their family history and genetic status, and for members of families in which a BRCA mutation may be present. Our web site can be a helpful resource for anyone who knows she is at risk, who wonders whether she might be at risk, or who cares about the issues and concerns that we face. 

They can also give you some great advice on how to monitor your breast health.  (monthly breast self-exam, yearly clinical exam by a physician and they would probably want you to start mammos earlier than age 40)  Mammos in very young woman are not always accurate because younger women (or small-breasted women) tend to have very dense breasts.  They might suggest MRI or ultrasound.

Good luck and hugs,

Margie

							Hello

Unfortunately getting healthcare without insurance is a big problem. But we can give you some advice. As someone mentioned, there are programs for women who need mammograms. They are free for those who qualify, but I am not sure about the details and whether you would qualify.

About your risk, the models take into consideration first-degree family members only, so if you have no sisters, daughters and your mother is not affected it is just like you did not have BC in your family. I am not saying that your risk is not higher, but with the current models it is very difficult to estimate. The lifetime risk of BC is currently 1/8, so there is a chance that your grandmother and aunts had sporadic breast cancer, not linked to genetics. Another thing that would help is to know when their diagnosis was made. If they were old, it is more likely to be sporadic, as opposed to a diagnosis at a young age.

							I had BC 4 years ago.  I have a 33 year old daughter who just had her first baby.  She has been told to wait until turning 35 before having a mammogram.  Being her Mother, I would feel better if she had one now.  

What is the right age now for younger women whose Mothers have had BC to get that first mammogram?
						

"

							Hello

What is usually recommended is to start screening 10 years earlier than the age of diagnosis of a first-degree family member. So if your mother was diagnosed at 35, you should start screening at 25.

							Thank you so much for responding to my question about my daughter.  I was DX at 52, I am now 56.  She is 33.   So I guess waiting until she is 35 seems reasonable before she has a screening, that's what her ob/gyn has told her. SEEMS REASONABLE TO EVERYONE BUT ME!!!!!!!

I have heard and talked to so many young women that have this horrible disease, and I guess I just want my daughter to do everything she can to catch it early.  It seems to me she would be in a much higher risk...mother with breast cancer, having her first baby at age 33...I don't know...I am rambling on and on here...she is not nearly as concerned about it as I am.

One thing that is recommended is to have a mammogram at an early age (30s) as a baseline. There is no recommendation exactly when this baseline mammogram should take place, but if she is so worried about this I guess it would not do any harm and would certainly reassure her.

							Hi , I hope you can help us we are at our wits end . Please bare with my long narritive
My healthy non smoking non drinking 33yrold husband started developing severe lower left side  abdominal pain around May , the pain would last for about 10-15min then subside. At first it was only in the morning , then it was periodically throughout the day, he went to our doc and was treated for EVERYTHING but colon cancer. IE he was treated for everything from a stomach infection to a spasmatic colon. They did blood work and a fecal test, even though there was visible blood in the fecal test they said it was normal. Still the pain wouldnt stop, finally they recommended a colonoscopy.Unfortunately they couldnt get him into be seen for one for 6 weeks , in the meantime he was sent to the ER one evening by our family doc when the pain was absolutely unbearable.
The Er doc pushed and prodded on his stomach , gave him ANOTHER prostrate exam. and finally said he thought it was reflux and gave him PEPCID!!!!!! when husband told him he didnt have heartburn the Er doc said and I quote "" the pepcid wont hurt you"" 

Finally got into the colonoscopy doctor , but they couldnt even complete the exam (even with a pediatric tube) , because at the first bend husbands colon was smaller than a pea.
Was sent to the surgeon the next day , 
He had surgery on Sept 27 2004 , the surgeon told us he had performed what he called a curative surgery , he removed all the cancer that he could visible see. He removed husbands sigmoid colon and the very top part of his rectum, removed 50 lymphnodes of which 3 were cancerous , 
found Cancer seeds in his abdominal wall lining , which he also removed.
Husband (Joe) now has a temporary ileostomy , 
Tomorrow morning he goes to get a port put in , so he can start chemo on Friday 
HOWEVER we are trying to find a new oncologist because the one we saw for our first consultation did not leave us feeling like there is ANY hope left.
This doctor had a meeting to go to , so was VERY rushed , for instance didnt even let the nurse take the vitals , he was on the phone for 3 minutes of our 10 minutes that we saw him, with whomever he had the other meeting with.
We have questions that went unanswered so I am hoping you can help us answer a few.
Oh by the way the Oncologist said he was going to use the ""cookbook"" method?? along with Oxaliplatin. 
Joe is suppose to get chemo for 48 hours straight every week or every other ( again wasnt real clear on this ) 

Our questions are this 

Is this a potentially curable cancer? I know stage 4 is pretty bad , 
the surgeon gave him a 70percent chance of it coming back , without chemo . 
and an overall 5yr survival rating of 30 percent again this is without chemo 
Does chemo give him better odds?
Any help you can give us at this time would be appreciated as we are lost.

Yes, it is potentially curable, I think.  The doctor who mediates the board is probably a better source than I; I am basing the opinion on what I know about the disease, being a Stage IV type myself (just a couple years older than your husband, in fact), and the facts that you present.  Actually, the facts that you present, the staging that you provide, and the survival rating do not necessarily make a great deal of sense.  In your husband's case, I think that the two things that make for a great deal of hope is the relative absense of lymph node involvement and the fact that, as you describe, no organs are involved.  I think more typically than not, Stage IV CRC has more lymph node involvement (for example, I had 15 or 18) and confirmed organ involvement - most notably the liver.  Notwithstanding the Peritoneal ""Seeds"", the cancer you describe would grade at Stage IIIa, which has 5 year survival rating 83% (most agree that surviving for either 5 or 7 years is equal to a cure).

Does chemo give him better odds?  Most certainly.  Once the cancer has spread beyond the musculature, surgeons cannot guarantee that that they will pick up every last cancerous cell.  Chemotherapy is designed to do just that - kill cells that are left behind.  Oxaliplatin is statistically the best way to go as a first line treatment.  The only thing that I might ask is whether or not it would be a good idea to add Avastin to the regimen.

Please post again or feel free to send an email if there is anything else that you think I can help with.

							Hello

I am deeply sorry to hear about your husband. It is very hard to use statistics and extrapolate the numbers to the individual patient. Chemotherapy will certainly increase his survival chance, by how much time is arguable. Unfortunately most oncologists would agree that his disease is not curable at this point, however he may have several years of survival. These peritoneal seeds are very important, and can give rise to a lot of problems, including bowel obstruction and so forth. I wish I had better news. But it is good that apparently he does not have other sites of metastasis, so this is in his favor.

Wish you and your husband the best of luck

							I just wanted to welcome you here and know that they have made big advances in treatment of colon cancer in just the past 2 years alone.    My husband had stage 4 with liver involvement and in on his third regime.  There is a new drug that can help block the blood flow to the cancer cells but cannot be used on people who have had strokes as it can increase the risk of strokes and heart attacks.   Read up on the chemo they want to give him.   Ask questions, even if they seem silly or unimportant.  Talk to his nurse as often as you need to to get questions answered.  

If you do not feel comfortable with this oncologist, get another one.   They are dealing with your husband and YOU also.  Talk to other people who have had cancer.   If you know any nurses, talk to them.  Some doctors have lousy bedside manners but are great when dealing with the cancer itself.   Might also help to join a support group.  Would you be willing or able to travel a little distance to see an oncologist with whom you might feel more comfortable with?   

I hope this has helped some.  

God bless you and yours.

							I had a bilateral mastectomy in May of this year.  IDC in the left breast and DCIC (less than 25% of the tumor) and a prophalactic simple mastectomy for the right.  My TNM was T1pN0MX, size of tumor was 1.2 cm

I had chemo 4rounds of A/C.  Passed on the Taxenes as I already have neuropathy.  Just getting ready to start on Arimidex.  No reconstruction yet.

Now, on the left side I discovered two lumps just below the scar line under the skin.  They are small -- almost BB size and my Oncologist was concerned but said we should wait and see if they change.

I am worried that it is a Local Recurrence.  There is so much Cancer in my family history. 

Should I wait the 3 months it will take me to get back into see him or should I call the surgeon and have him take a look.   The Oncologist said they might be too small for him to want to remove.   What is the advantage of waiting?   How can something that ""might"" be cancer, be too small to remove?

I am thin, so a needle biopsy might be a risk, but as far as how I feel about it, they should just do an exisional biopsy right now!

							Hello

If you are concerned about this, you could see your surgeon for a biopsy. The scar is very superficial and it is fairly easy to get a biopsy with local anesthesia only. 

If it is indeed the skin that is forming nodules, the only way the breast cancer can get there is by seeding when the original surgery was done, and since you mentioned that it was a small tumor, it is unlikely to happen. But it unfortunately can, as nothing is 100% in Medicine.

							Cat, 
Some of the best advice I have gotten along the way is to let the expert be the judge.  Allow the oncologist  to manage systemic treatments and refer to your surgeon as the expert in evaluating the lumps & surgical scars.  It is important to hear and consider your medical teams opinions in each others area of expertise; but always utilize the the doctor whose specialty exclusively manages your area of concern.

PS. I am also not a fan of watch and wait.

							Thanks. I know that this is probably benign. The Dr. did say that it does not feel like a cyst and that the location and feel of it is a little suspicious.

							My mom was diagnosed with small cell lung cancer last year around february.  I don't know if the cancer of your friend's is small cell or non small cell lung cancer but as far as what to expect; it's going to be a battle.  When we first diagnosed it, she was still in stage 1(only two stages for small cell).  We went through both chemo and radiation treatments.  Initially the cancer cells went away after the treatments. (Treatments by the way will take a toll on the patient - radiation especially but depends on the person).  Within a few months, the cancer returned and in full force spreading to her liver, abdomen and bone.  She is on nothing but pain meds now through hospice care.  The prognosis in her advanced stage is within weeks.  We are still fighting and hoping but ultimately it has been a losing battle.  If you have any questions regarding my experiences and what to expect, I have no problems sharing and hopefully my experiences will help you get through yours.

							My wife has advanced secondary liver cancer from a primary source in the colon. She probably has only a very few months to live.

Doctors seem extremely reluctant to answer questions about what to expect in the final stages. I think the main problem is that all patients are different, and they can't predict what will happen in a particular case. Also they seem to want to avoid upsetting us. It almost seems as thought there is a conspiracy of silence!

Of course we do know that not everyone is the same. However we are amongst those who really do want to know what the possible range of symptoms could be. We can cope with that far better than not knowing anything at all and just waiting for the unknown to happen without warning.

Is there any information available about the possible range of symptoms that occurs in various cases? eg Can we expect to have to deal with serious pain? Loss of appetite? Jaundice? Mental confusion? Loss of mobility? Metastasis to other organs? Mestastasis to bones? Anything else? What is the frequency of occurrenceof these things in final stage patients? 

We have conflicting answers from doctors. We have been told by one source that most liver cancer patients experience almost no pain and few other symptoms apart from gradually wasting away and dying without much discomfort. Others have hinted at things far worse and talk about pain relief, and control of nausea, but won't get specific. 

Where can I get information which will tell us the truth about all this? Can someone please help?

							A book that I found helpful is The Liver Disorders Sourcebook by Howard J. Worman, M.D., 1999.

The liver has less ability to sense pain other than maybe pressure due to change in size. I don't know why secondary liver cancer would be any different from primary liver cancer, which according to the Sloan Kettering website, 

http://www.mskcc.org/mskcc/html/273.cfm 

""Many patients with primary liver cancer have no symptoms at all. In some instances, jaundice (when the skin and the whites of the eyes become yellow, urine darkens, and the color of stool becomes lighter than normal), malaise, or a general feeling of poor health, loss of appetite, weight loss, fever, fatigue, bloating, itching, swelling of the legs, or a sense of general weakness may be present. Abdominal pain or discomfort may also occur.""

I had a 1 cm lump removed (from upper outer quadrant of left breast) for biopsy 10/22, and found out on 10/28 that it was IDC, with 15% of the 1 cm lump still being DCIS. The 3 mm margins were clear. It's grade III (8, not 9), ER/PR+, aneuploid, and Her2/neu borderline (FISH is being done...don't have results yet). My PET scan was clear. I have wide excision and SNB scheduled for 11/22, and if the breast tissue is clean, I'll have chemo, then rads, then I assume Tamoxifen or Arimidex (haven't talked to oncologist since we found out it's ER/PR+). If the breast tissue isn't clear, my surgeon will do a mastectomy. My surgeon is listed with Best Doctors in America, and my oncologist is one she recommended and has an excellent reputation and credentials. I'm also going to Moffitt in Tampa for 2nd opinion and treatment recommendation. My gynecologist told me I have a 90-95% chance (I assume she meant for a cure) and my oncologist told me 85-95% (at that time, he thought I'd be ER/PR- because of my age), and that he'd expect to see me at his retirement party 15 yrs down the road. I know this isn't child's play, but what about long-term BC survivors we all know about?  I mean, if you're alive 45 years later with no recurrence, isn't that a cure???

Also, I've been told by my docs, and read on BC websites and in Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book that survival rates are the same for lumpectomy w/ rads (if you're a candidate for that) or mastectomy. My oncologist's nurse practitioner reassured me that since it appears right now that I am a candidate for lumpectomy w/ rads, that it's purely a personal choice on my part and will NOT affect my chance for survival. Can I feel reassured that that's the case? I have read about a lot of women opting for mastectomy when they could've had lumpectomies and rads, according to what they said their docs said, because they were nervous about recurrence. I'd prefer lumpectomy and rads, but dread the thought of recurrence in the remaining breast tissue down the road (although I've read that even with mastectomy, you can have recurrence in the scar...not common, but possible)...and what about the other breast? I don't want to have a bilateral mastectomy unnecessarily just out of fear, but I'm willing to do whatever it takes to give myself the best odds too. 

AND I haven't educated myself yet about rads (haven't had time yet) but I've read some women's posts about their dread of it. Yet I've known people who've had rads (for other cancers, like lymphoma) and they said it wasn't bad at all. Is it something to be dreaded?

After being terrified out of my mind for 10 days, I've had a couple of relatively good, hopeful days. Now I'm running scared again. Help!

I'm confused now.....nothing new I know   I was told there was no cure for BC because there is no way to know if every cancer cell was gotten by chemo and that it just takes one to start mutating.  I know that women can live to be little old ladies, but that black cloud is still hanging over their head that it might come back.   know mine wasn't caught early since the mammogram missed my 5.5 cm tumor when I found it and that I'm high risk but doing good almost 3 years later.  How do we know is the chemo and/or radiation got it all?  I have so much radiation damage, I don't know how anything could still be alive there, but I'm wondering about cells in the blood stream that could have hidden out from chemo.
Thanks for any info

							Nancy,

This is a huge area in research. Unfortunately there is currently no way of knowing whether therapy has eradicated all cells. I would really love to have such a test, and tell my patients that everything is gone and that they do not need any further follow-up. Unfortunately cancer patients will always have some doubt that it might come back to haunt them...

							Hi,

I will share my own experience.  After I finished ALL my treatments, (it was my last day of rads) I asked my radiation oncologist at the check-up if I was ""cured"" or in ""remission.""  These are  his words:  ""We cannot say cured.  We HOPE you are cured, but we say NED  (no evidence of disease) because it is possible for breast cancer to come back for the rest of your life."" 

Now, this does not mean that it will come back.  Some women end up cured....they're just not sure which women will be cured for the reasons Muttsmom said....there COULD be microscopic cells lurking or dormant somewhere in the body.  My oncolgist told me there is no test to determine this.  If there were, lots of women would be spared treatments that they did not need.  They are hoping that the chemo kills any possible renegade cancer cells in the body.

But most women are cured.  I think the number is around 80 percent.  It's just hard to determine who will be in those numbers.  Of course, the best place to be is stage 0.  But I believe optimism should rule.  I decided to see myself as in that 80 percent.

							Interesting thread to be sure....Cure...what cure?

Let me see...the guidelines are usually ""5"" years statistically, but what if the bc has already planted itself in another area of the body after that point marker? And, let me see..we need to lop off our breasts; undergo poison toxic chemicals; and or burn our bodies. What has happened to all those millions and I mean millions of dollars that have been pouring into research and such, and here we are still using the same ole treatments and NOT guaranteed a reccurrance will happen.

I had cancer in both breasts; high histologic grade tumor, vascular invasion; almost guaranteed that I will have a reoccurance in time.

There is no cure, ladies.

							Hello

Unfortunately the answers to cure cancer are not simple at all. All the millions of dollars are working, as reflected by a signifficant increase in survival rates in most cancers. In the specific area of breast cancer, look at all the different molecular markers that were discovered and targeted: ER/PR, HER2 are just examples of what is to come. The request to cure cancer seems so simple, to eradicate a few cells that are not working well, but it sometimes feels just like digging deeper and deeper and things look more complicated. Believe it or not, there are not nearly enough people to conduct enough research in this field, given the enormous complexity of it. 

Like I said, if I had that magic bullet to tell which of you will remain cancer free I would be extremely happy, but it's just not possible right now...

							Hi there, I'm a survivor and I'm de-lurking to share some info.....

A doctor in Germany has developed a bone marrow test that indicates if there are disseminated dormant cancer cells floating around in the body subsequent to treatment.   There was a clinical study done last summer, I have not received any information on it.  Here are some exerpts from my correspondence with the doctor, from a year ago:

""I could only offer you that we check your bone marrow for disseminated cells, and if you can send slides to us where we detect disseminated cancer cells we might be able to check the ""activity"" of your potentially present but latent disease.  My colleagues have clinical experience with antibody therapies against disseminated cancer cells. They might have an advice with regard to the therapeutic options.

If you are willing to bear a bone marrow aspiration, your oncologist would need to isolate mononuclear cells by Ficoll density gradient centrifugation and prepare slides that could be shipped to us (we would provide special slides and a protocol). Alternatively, I received one year ago a mail from a German collegue in Seattle who is studying single disseminated cancer cells in prostate cancer. His group should be able to perform all steps required, from bone marrow aspiration to slide preparation (although he would need to use our special slides as well; we need those slides to isolate the tumor cells later on). I do not know whether other groups in the Seattle work on breast cancer.

The second possibility would be to check for the activity of your disease using blood samples. Detection rates of tumor cells are lower than in bone marrow but they can be easily obtained. 20ml of peripheral blood seem to be efficient to detect at least in some patients active disease. Perhaps this approach might be more convenient for the moment, although I have to admit, that we know less about tumor cells in the peripheral blood than in bone marrow.""

Regarding ""The Cure"", a number of issues arise, business and political to name just two.  If you haven't read the book on how Herceptin was developed, (sorry I forget the name right now) read it.  You will gain a clear understanding of the politics and personal agendas involved in research.  I suspect these issues are common throughout breast cancer research and unfortunately we the 'end users' are greatly affected.

As for the bone marrow aspiration, well I haven't done it... yet.  I have been NED for 8 1/2 years and 4 years (a primary on each side) and have been poked, prodded, sliced, diced, squished and nuked enough for the time being....lol

For those of you waiting for results, newly diagnosed or in treatment {{{Hugs}}}.  Hang in there, once you finish treatment you'll find your ""new"" normal.  I'm here to tell you that life can be good again,  you can feel well and happy again, it just doesn't happen as fast as we'd like it to.

							Indeed this is an interesting thread. Liza, I was diagnosed in April 1996. Yes, 1996. I had a 6 mm tumor in my left breast (about 3 o'clock). I had lumpectomy, radiation and took tamoxifen for five years. No chemo. Well, it has been 8 1/2 years. Do I think I am cured? I sure hope so. Do I assume that cancer will never return. No way. I see my onc. annually (and right now I am five months late   ), have a mammogram annually and do monthly BSEs. In the meantime, I remain NED and just take it one day at a time. Good luck to you.

Unfortunately kidney cancer can not be cured at this stage, but survival can be extended with treatment. It is a slowly growing tumor most of the time, so treatment can be effective at prolonging survival. You can check SEERS for statistics about survival.

							first of all, renal cell cancer with mets to the lung is very different from small cell lung cancer with mets to the kidney(s).
renal cell cancer is a very special disease because they can be slow growing and the patient may survive for long-term with stage IV disease. secondly, resection of the primary disease (the kidney with cancer) MAY cure the disease in the secondary areas. this sounds strange but is true and there is a paper a couple of years ago in new england journal medicine. althogh most patients with stage iv rcc will not receive nephrectomy, but usually the oncologists will mention this if nephrectomy is appropriate for an individual's treatment.
stage iv rcc is not curable in most cases, treatment with interferon or chemotherapy provides response in some patients. for more info about renal cell cancer, please read

							Hello

I am not sure what your doctor mentioned about going on-line and checking about an MRI. I think he is the one that should be looking for this information and helping you with this. If he has doubts he should contact the radiologist and see if it fits or not. I think that doctors have to be proactive and look for answers as they try to serve as counsellors. That is why you sought his expertise, right ?

I am not a radiologist, so I can not comment on what a typical DCIS looks like by MRI.

							Hello all (and Dr. Leo);

I'm just trying to get my ducks in a row.....

My wife is ILC, 2cm with 9/14 nodes positive, grade 2.

At the last onc. meeting, the final pathology regrading hormone status was not yet ready (the onc. was furious over this). But she did say that if my wife was post-menopausal (which she is) and the hormone status was positive, it could mean that instead of coming in for chemo, my wife would take pill medication at home and come to the hospital for monitoring.

I took that to mean the chemo was in pill form.

My wife took it to mean she did not need chemo.

I didn't know she thought this until just a day or two ago. Now she has had a CT scan regarding an enlarged kidney, the hr/pr status is positive, and we go back to see the onc. on Monday.

Is it even remotely possible that chemo will not be recommended? I have to say that I hope not!

							Hi Pastor Rich,

I would  think that if she has an invasive 2 centimeter tumor that chemo would be recommended if she is in good health.  Sometimes they skip the chemo if someone does not have good health or is very elderly.  Talk to your doctor again.

Also, the ""take the pill at  home"" sound like it may be hormonal therapy - Tamoxifen or Arimidex,  if her hormone receptors are positive

							Hi Pastor Rich,
I was dx stage III Invasive Lobular 2/14/02 at 43 years young.  I had a 5.5 cm tumor with 9+/16 lymph nodes.  My oncologist said that he needed to treat it aggressively.  I have 6 rounds of cytoxin, epirubensin (sp) and 5FU at the same time, 3 weeks apart and then on to radiation.  I also had a mastectomy and opted last year to have the other one removed.  If they don't want to do chemo, ask them WHY and then find another oncologist.
Keep us posted

							Pastor Rich,  Another stage III person responding here.  I am sure that what the doc meant was since she was er postive then a hormonal will be part of the treatment to deal with the estrogen production issue... I do not think that meant that they did not intend to do chemo as well, only that she would be given a hormonal drug also.  In her case depending on whether or not she is premenopausal or post either tomoxifen, arimdex or femera.  As far as the chemo goes I had andryamicin/ Cytoxin (A/C), then radiation then Taxol.  As that it has spread to the lymph nodes they will most likely hit it with aggressive chemo, which they refer to as systemic chemo.  The taxol or taxetere is approved and recommended here for node positive women, I understand that you are not in the states but friend that I have had in canada also have had taxol being node positive.  I had a mastectomy but still had to have the radiation as that they needed to zap the lymph nodes, mine were positive too.  So I assume, which is usually a big mistake on my part    , that the doc only meant that the hormonal will be a part of the whole picture.  Again, hang in there, it seems like I say this alot to you and your wife, this seems to be taking a while to get everything in place for her.  Let us know what the oncologist finally says to her, and we will be here to help in anyway that we can, even if it is hold your hand...I know that it is hard not to freak out with the stage thing, I did, but here I sit six years later and going strong and NED (no evidence of disease).

							Hi Pastor Rich,

here in England the standard treatment for a tumour 1 cm or over, and with nodal involvement is surgery, chemo, radiotherapy, then hormone treatment if ER+. I had a 2 cm tumour, 3/18 nodes positive and wasn't given an option about chemo, that is if I wanted to live and I do!
It was a tough time as I also have Crohn's and had to stop my chemo treatment (methotrexate) whilst having FEC chemo and ended up sipping a nutritional fruit juice for 3 months, as well as being faecally incontinent.
So, if I could do it under those circumstances, anyone can. Having a supportive, caring husband is vital and I was extremely fortunate in that respect. I hope the consultation goes well for you both on Monday and a treatment plan is worked out that you agree with.

							Hello

Having a swollen lymphnode in the axilla is not an uncommon thing. You should follow up with the doctor you saw. Your arm should improve, since this is most likely only lymphadenitis, which means that the lymphnodes are swollen due to some stimuli, for example a small infection. Anything from a small cut in your hand or fingers to a small infected pore in your underarm could cause it, but sometimes you don't even notice anything out of the ordinary. But again, you should follow up to make sure it goes back to normal.

							In August I noticed painless enlarged lymph nodes in my left armpit.  At this time there were no changes in my breast.  I was referred to a surgeon by my PC physician.  He did a CT scan of my trunk, which showed diffuse lymphadenopathy on the left side: armpit, abdomen, and groin.  The nodes in my armpit were biopsied, and the report was that they were non-maligant.  About 3 weeks after the biopsy, I noticed a discoloration and swelling in my left breast.  Initially, I told myself that it was probably caused by the biopsy.  Two weeks later, when I began to feel a burning inside the breast, and the pink discoloration had spread, I called my surgeon.  He ordered a mammogram, which showed no change from the one I had in Nov 03.  I saw the surgeon the next day, after examining my breast and biopsy site, he saw no connection.  He gave no indication that it looked like mastitis.  He did say we must rule out inflammatory breast cancer, although he really didn't see that.  He prescribed Keflex 2000mg daily for seven days, and said to come back in two weeks.   I have been on the antibiotics for 5 days, and there is no improvement in my breast.  Actually it seems a little worse.
I am concerned about having to wait another week to see the surgeon.  If he decides to biopsy, it may be another week.  What I have read about IBC sure sounds like it could be a possiblity, especially since the antibiotics do not seem to be working.  Has anyone had an experience like this?  Please share your thoughts.

							I've never had IBC, but from what I've heard from ladies who have, the tissue is red.  That's really about all I know about it except they do treat it with chemo and the sooner the better.  Don't wait another week.  There is no reason for you onco to get upset if you are feeling uneasy about this.  Call tomorrow and get an appt. to be seen.  If it's not IBC, then your mind is at peace, if it is, let the tretments begin.

							Could someone please tell me what is a calcified breast lump? Thank you
						

"
"


							Hi,
I am not certain, but I think you may be refering to ""calcifications"".  Sometimes during a mamogram to diagnose a  breast lump, they find calcificatins in or around the lump.  Small, tightly clustered calcifications need further investigation.  Large calcifications, widely spaced apart are generally considered safe and just a sign of normal wear and tear of breast tissue.

I hope that this is a correct response to the term that you are referring to.
						

"
"


							I have just had 2 surgeries, first to remove calcifications, think I had 3 very tiny ones.  The margin was not clear on one side so he had to reexcise and then it was clear.  I did not have any lump.  These are tiny things that when arranged a certain way has the possibility of being cancer.  They actually call DCIS, in Situ as being precancerous, even though the cells removed are dead cancer cells. (A rose by any other name.)  DCIS can also be invasive which is worse though they say both can be cured.  I am now waiting to hear if I can have MammoSite instead of the 6 week radiation treatment - and getting very antsy.

							I don't know why a doctor would say the word Cure when it comes to any kind of breast cancer, there is no cure.  You can stay NED (No Evidence of Disease) but any dx of BC has the chance of coming back, either in the same breast or the liver, lungs, brain etc.  
I don't know if this is the norm, but a friend of mine had microcalifications but none clustered enough to do a biopsy on them.  They waited and watched even though she had BC in the other breast the year prior and wanted another mastectomy.  Finally, when they did cluster enough for a biopsy, it was cancer.  Not to say this is true for everyone, and I know in some cases, not many, that you have to wait and see if there is no way to check them out.  I might get a 2nd opinion and definately stay on top of it.  IF it is cancer, some are very slow growing and some are very aggressive.

							Hi Kaz,

I know this is a horrible time for you, worrying and wondering.  I had microcalcifications and ended up with a sterotactic bx.  It really was ok, not too uncomfortable.  You lay on a table that has a hole your breast falls into.  They ""clamp"" the breast and look at live pictures so they can see where they need to go.  They take multiple biopsies about the size of a pencil lead ---- but only after you are numbed.  I had a wonderful nurse who explained everything before it happened.  Once I was diagnosed I opted for a bilateral.  I had a biopsy on the opposite breast three years previous for calcifications and my mother had Paget's disease which is a form of cancer of the breast. Also, my total area was >5CM and I am older so a bilateral seemed the most sensible. 

I wish you luck and know that you are among a very caring and sharing group of women on this website.  Don't be afraid to ask quesitons.  Write your questions down, if indeed you have BC (and you may not!) start a diary, take a familymember/friend with you to visits ... another pair of ears is priceless,

The diagnosis for APL is not difficult, usually flow cytometry of peripheral blood and bone marrow can diagnose it. Treatment is usually in the form of ATRA, an oral medication, and chemotherapy. It is one of the most treatable acute leukemias.

							I actually have APL leukemia and have undergone chemo and am currently on ATRA.  During my month in the hospital I ended up with pretty nasty back pain that is still going on (a little over a year later) but the doctors think it's unrelated to cancer.  As far as long term effects, I shouldn't have any.  I've been told this is typical for APL patients as long as chemotherapy works.  Lemme know if there's anything else I can tell you.

							I've also been treated for APL and towards the end of my hospital stay they had a hard time drawing blood and getting IV sites to work for more than a day.  They told me it was because the veins harden and lose elasticity.  Is this something that is reversed with time, or is there some medication or herb that I can take?

							Hello

Problems with veins is usually due to several blood draws, and more importantly, chemotherapy which can damage the veins. It usually does not get better, and there is not much to do.

							Hi,
I am 11 months post bilateral mastectomy.  The path report following surgery revealed a 2.7 cm lesion of DCIS, poorly differentiated, intermediate grade with necrosis as well as LCIS.  No chemo or radiation was deemed needed as they felt they got everything.   Five days prior to the mastectomy, I underwent an excisional biopsy for a lump that developed on my sternum in between my breast.  That biopsy reveal ADH & LCIS.

About three weeks ago, I noticed a small firm nodular lump suddenly appear on my sternum in the middle of my breasts in my previously flat biopsy scar.  Feeling a little silly because I was ""cured"", I went ahead and saw my PCP and asked him to take a look.  He indicated that this was a little late in the game for a formation of a keloid scar, but he thought that is what it might be.  He did ask me to make an appointment with my surgical onc. to make certain that it was nothing more.  I have made the appointment, but would really like some feedback from any of you that have had an experience like this.

Also, do they normally get any breast tissue/cells that reside in between your breast during mastectomy?

Thanks for ANY feedback,

Even though a lot of care is taken during the surgery, some cells may actually go to close areas. You are right about having someone evaluate this. It is uncommon, but it can happen.

							Hello

CLL is a really indolent disease. It is a disease that usually affect older folks, and most of the times patients die from causes other than the CLL. If it is considered a stage 0, meaning nothing is being affected by the disease, only the white count is high, no treatment is necessary, only monitoring. 

You can check www.nccn.org for more info, but CLL is definitely not one of the worst leukemias to have.

I am 57 and have had CLL for four years.  I had chemotherapy a year and a half ago.  Although my cancer is not gone, I am teaching again and I am doing well.  I do seem to have more infections than before but they are minor right now.   My oncologist thinks I will need chemo again some day, but right now I am enjoying life.  I have never talked with anyone else who has CLL.  Maybe I can help.  The diagnosis is frightening but because this type of leukemia is so slow to progress, it is a disease you can live with - literally.  Mary Anne

							my wife just died of small cell lung cancer.  She was in 100% remission aacording to her doctor.  the continuation of both chemo and radiation therapy, however, brought her blood counts to the floor, and she had to hospitalized again.  about 10 days later, she got an infection in her brain (encephalitis they think), and was being treated for that.  her response became worse over the next 3 or 4 days, until she could no longer respond to a simple question.  2 days later, she died - still complettly unresponsive.  Obviously the treatment did not work.  i am devistated, because i think the combination of chemo and radiation was just too much for little body, and i believe the dr should have know this, as she was in his care for about 3 months (he already had to reduce the chemo dosage because it hurt her blood counts so much).

has anyone had similiar circumstances?  where you thought your loved one was doing great, to find out that the treatment killed her???

							Dear Sir

I am very sorry to hear about your wife. There is always the risk of severe infections with most chemotherapy regimens, and unfortunately some patients will ultimately die due to these infections. It is part of the doctor's duty to inform the patient of the risks, benefits and alternatives involved with any treatment, including chemotherapy.

I wish the circumstances were different, but this is a sad side-effect of the potent drugs that are used...

							I am so sorry for your loss.  Recently my aunt was diagnosed with lung cancer that went to her brain.  She was given 15 treatments of radiation and has now started chemo.  She has had 3 treatments and seems to always be sick with a cold or sinus problems.  Her blood counts too are low and she is so sick from the chemo.  It seems that the treatment is killing her faster than the disease.  She has not told us to much about what the dr has said but I fear it is not good.  It does make you wonder why have the treatment and be so sick from it rather than just living life to the fullest before the disease takes over.

Depending on how invasive the cancer is, it is possible that you might have to have a total hysterectomy. In early stages, the chance of cure from cervical cancer is really good. But your doctor will stage your disease to see how disseminated it is and formulate an appropriate plan.

							Hi, I'm butting in here to see if I can help with the second part of your question.

I am a participant in a clinical trial called the Ovarian Cancer Early Detection Study. One of the requirements for this study is that at least one family member must have had breast cancer and have been premenopausal at the time. The study involves genetic relationships between those who have had bc and have more likelihood for having ovarian cancer. It also involves having annual transvaginal ultrasounds as well as quarterly blood draws in the hope of finding better ways to detect ovarian cancer in those who are most likely to end up with it.

She is back at Duke today because they called her a few weeks ago and said they found some clots in her veins and arteries.  I am so confused with her condition, I don't know what to think.  I am waiting for her husband to call me with some news.  She lives in Georgia, but has been making trips here to North Carolina.

 Hi AlaskaAngel....just got off the phone with my sister...she and her husband are on their way back to Georgia.  She had MRI done of abdominal area yesterday.  Showed everthing ok??????  He wants her back at Duke in 3 weeks for colonoscopy and endoscopy.  I have lost count on the number of tests she has had...I know of 2 colonoscopies she has had in the past 3 months.  This will be the first one done at Duke Hospital.  I'm getting so frustrated for her I don't know what to do!!!!  She and her husband are beyond frustration.  On top of everything, they both came down with really bad colds while here for Christmas.  I told her to go home, rest, drink plenty of fluids and try to get over this cold right now..last thing she needs is for her immune system to be down.  She also said the doctor at Duke told her "" he was going to find out what is going on with her"".  Famous last words!!!  I just don't know anymore.

							Hi Liza!

What hospital are you going to for treatment???  I know that things have changed since my first bout with cancer in 1990; but a good deal of the learning/research hospitals receive federal funding and are not allowed to deny treatment because of an inability to pay.

I would suggest receiving treatment from one of them anyway because those doctors r up on the latest developments & use a ""team method"" to treat patients; therefore, you are getting the benefit of several minds working together.

Call places like Cancer Care & the American Cancer Society as well as the Komen Foundation to see what programs you may qualify for with them.

Additionally, there is a program for the ""Medically Needy"" in Florida.  I will post the link for the brochure in a separate post.  

{Link deleted by adim}

""Individuals that are not eligible for Medicaid because their income or assets exceed the Medicaid program limits may qualify for the Medically Needy program. Individuals enrolled in Medically Needy must incur a certain amount of medical bills each month before Medicaid can be approved.""

Don't get discouraged if Medicaid & SSD turn you down the first time.  Reapply or file for an appeal if that happens.  It is THEIR JOB to say no; but it's OUR JOB to follow up on our cancer treatments & beat the ba$t@rd!!!

							Hi, Nancy,
Sorry about the need for further surgery.  Hope this is the last for a long, long time!  I have a couple of ideas to consider for avoiding lymphedema (LE).  The first is to keep careful track of your temperature for at least the first week post-surgery and let your doctor know right away if there's any rise in temp so he/she can stay on top of the possibility of infection.  Don't wait until you feel feverish.  Be alert for other indications of infection, too, like redness, swelling, or warmth at the site.  Second, don't use hot compresses for post-surg pain, as that kind of heat can trigger LE.  And thirdly, do you know any women with arm LE who can teach you limb massage?  It's VERY different from other types of massage and both method and direction are critical, so it's not something I'd suggest trying without knowledgable help.  But if you could get someone to teach you, LE massage after surgery might very well help prevent its development.  In reports given at the recent National Lymphedema Network convention, a practitioner presented evidence that massage before-the-fact may actually prevent LE.  In any case, LE massage, because it encourages the functioning of the lymph system which is the body's ""garbage disposal"" system, can aid healing.  Just a thought.

Even aside from all the anxiety, I agree being knocked out for surgery gets old.  All best wishes to you--you'll be in my thoughts and prayers.

							Hi, I was dx in Sept. with bilateral lobular carcinoma. I had double mast. Oct 20th, right breast tumor was 9 cm and 16/16 nodes positive, left breast tumor was 12cm and 18/23 nodes positive. Based on that I am stage 3C pending outcome of PET scans done Friday, which may move me into stage 4. I just turned 45 a few weeks ago. I had hysterectomy in 1998 for cysts and endometriosis. still have one ovary, but not sure if I am pre or post menopausal since haven't had period since hysterectomy.

Are there other bilateral lobular carcinoma women out there who have had extensive nodal involvement at diagnosis? My oncologist said that I have a 50% chance of being alive in 2 years, I'm scared. I'm having a port put in on Wednesday, they will put an IV in my hand even though I had nodes removed from both sides, they don't want to use feet or jugular. Then I'll start my first round of chemo on Monday, and have treatments every other week.

							Hi, I have been going through what you are now facing, just a little earlier than you since my treatment ended in September and I've been on tamoxifin since then.  I had tumors in both sides and also had many affected nodes. I've had IVs in my hands 3 or 4 times (port insertion, CT scan and first chemo) since, plus lots of blood work. All very scary but if you take it a day at a time, you will get through it! Don't listen to any crap about survival rates since we can't do anything about that anyway. Just keep fighting and stay strong, best way to a great outcome.

It's very scary. I know I'm not so unusual with my diagnosis, but I hadn't found anyone yet who was similar to me with both breasts and extensive nodes. Thanks again for your response. I appreciate it.Jan

							Hi,
I can't relate to to your specific experience, but I just wanted to send good wishes!  It is important for you to know that the medications that are avialble today can do great things as it relates to stomping out those cancer cells!

I agree with the previoius post that you can't get sucked into the statistics game.  People seem to need numbers, so that is why they are there.  Each of us are so unique metabolically that it is really almost impossible to pigeon hole us into groups.  

Stay strong!

							JM, I was not diagnosed under your circumstances... but I do want to say to you and other women on this forum that are newly diagnosed a few things that I have learned and seen over the past 5 years that I have been around different boards and different men and women who have traveled this road along my side... statistics are just numbers on papers or that come out of peoples mouths.. you are not a statistic!  If we look at statistics we can look at them in one of two ways, is the glass half empty or is it half full?  If we must look at statistics as the answer then who is to say you do not fall into the 50% of people who are surviving and thriving?  How recent are those statistics?  In the 6 years since my initial diagnosis there have been so many new treatment protocols and advancements made in regards to the treatment of this disease.  Many in the medical profession now view this as a chronic disease as opposed to a terminal one even at stage IV.  I know that when I was first diagnosed I was a statistics seeker and spent alot of time comparing my cancer with other's.  I do admit that there are times like right now when I do have a few of my friend who were diagnosed at stages earlier then mine that are experiencing mets, that the paranoia sets in... but I have to keep reminding myself that that is their cancer not mine... we are all different in so many ways.. and our body's react to the treatments etc. differently.  I was told by my surgeon to not be that upset as that I had a good chance of surviving for at least 5 years.. my oncologist told me that I should ignore that comment.  There are no guarentees either way in life or in this battle but do not let anyone, including your doctors take away your hope, your dreams or sanity by believing you are a statistic.  I was diagnosed 6 years ago this month at stage III and evidently I have proved my surgeons statistics to be wrong...so far... I have had many friends who have also outlived their statistics as are surviving as well... OK, stepping down off my pedestal now   ... just wanted to let you know that your treatments and everything that you will experience in the future, though not easy is doable.  Always have your hope and always plan for your future... needless to say there is always room for miracles in our lives as well... what can I say I am a BC survivor and a  life long Red Sox fan as well     Hang in there!

							I have to agree with what everyone else is saying.  When I was dx Stage II, Invasive Lobular BC with a 5.5 cm tumor and 9+/16 nodes, I was given a 50/50 chance of being alive without a reoccurence in 5 years.  My onco doesn't like using stats because they are just that stats.  That doesn't take into consideration, age (I was 43 and dx 2/14/02), er/pr status, Her2Neu stats and they also include those who chose no chemo/rads and go the ""natural"" route which to me is crazy.  Suppliments are good, if they don't interfer with conventional treatment with chemo which has proven time and time again to work.  Look at Suzanne Sommers who ticks me off beyond words.  She decided against chemo because it was ""Poison"" but instead is taking extract from mistletoe.  What do they tell us if we have mistletoe in our trees?  Cut it down, it's poison and will kill the tree.  
Lobular is prone to mirror itself in the other breast, which is just what yours did.  I had a simple mastectomy on the other breast so mine couldn't do that.  I was fortunate in that regard, but my mammogram missed a 5.5 cm tumor.  It's been almost 3 years and I'm doing great.  My onco doesn't do scans regularily, but if I have a problem he does.  Ends up I had another bone scan, chest x-ray and ultra sound of my upper right quad (liver, pancreas etc) and of course all the lab work.  My pain was from Arimidex and osteop (he did a bone density test too).  So, he is as sure as can possibly be that I'm NED (No Evidence of Disease).  TRY not to listen to stats because we are all indivduals.  I like Barbara and many others, get really scared at time when he hear about others that have mets.  BUT, look at me and Barbara being Stage III and so far so good.  I've seen ladies with tiny tumors and no nodes have reoccurences.  Get mad as hell at this disease and get your battle armour on and go kick some cancer butt.

							JM -- your situation is similar to mine, but not exact.  My tumor was in my left breast, ended up to be about 7cm in size, and I had 20 out of 22 positive nodes.  I also had numerous kinds of cancer -- predominently invasive lobular, but also DCIS, invasive ductal, and Paget's disease.  My tumor(s) were categorized as being very aggressive.  Good news is that I wasn't HER/2 positive and I was ER/PR positive.  Because lobular has a high rate of recurrence in the other breast, I chose to have my right breast also removed.  I was 44 yrs old at the time of my diagnosis. 

We are also similar in what the doctor told me were my chances of survival.  She told me that I have a 20% chance of living 2 years.  After I spent a year doing treatments, I found out that she meant 2 years from diagnosis and not end of treatment, which ticked me off greatly.  I think I have a good idea of what you are going through and how scary it is to hear those words.  

However, after surgery, 6 months of chemo, then radiation and Tamoxifen, I have been cancer-free for almost 4 years and plan to go on for many, many more.  I beat their odds and I'm proud of that.  And as I said, will continue to.  The goal as I see it is to stay alive long enough to see the cure for this!  

The good news with taking Tamoxifen is that it works great for 5 years and then you go on to Femara for another five.  Those two combinations have had great success.  My doctor defines post-menopausal as being without a period for 1 year.  I'm not sure how that would relate to having had a hysterectomy, but I was pre-menopausal prior to chemo, have both of my ovaries, and chemo put me into menopause.  She considers me to be post-menopausal.  So even though you have one ovary doesn't necessarily mean that it is producing estrogen, but they should be able to do a test to find that out.

Hang in there!  I won't tell you to not think about those stats because I know that you will -- and will always, although it does lessen with time.  Please let me know if there is anything that I can do to help you.

							Hi,
 I was diagnosed 5/23/03, invasive dcis 2.3 cm,2 of 14 nodes positive, er/pr positive, her negative. Right mast 6/20/03, 4AC &4T8/21/03 through 1/15/04, 28 rads ending 4/28/04 ( rt breast, lymph nodes, super clav. nodes & mam nodes). Started arimidex 5/04, since chemo put me in menopause,(last cycle 9/21/03). Well cycles came back 8/24/04, so I had to stop arimidex. Blood work came back I was in a ""gray area"". Waiting for my onc appointment on 11/29/04 to discuss treatment. Doctor will want me to start tamoxifin, but I have heard of people doing lupron with arimidex. I think I like this choice better. I did arimidex for 4 months and feel I can deal with the side effects, but am afraid of tamoxifin. My dad has a problem with blood clots (pulminary embolisims) and I am afraid I might also. I have been told my doctor likes to follow studies, so I am trying to find any on lupron with arimidex. Any info would be appriciated.

While tamoxifen certainly gives you a higher chance of pulmonary embolism, the choice between that and leuprolide/anastrozole is not straight-forward. I can not offer specific advice about which way to go, but encourage you to talk to your doctor.

							I was on Lupron and Tamoxifen together and didn't have many side effects for a long time.   Most Lupron takers have hot flashes, but I escaped that too.  I stopped the Lupron last year since it appears I am finally post-menopausal.  However, the tamoxifen has caused hyperplasia in my uterus so he is switching me to Arimidex.  I'm hoping I adapt as well to it.  I'm nervous because Tamoxifen was working so well.

							Hi everyone. I'm starting to panic over my upcoming port insertion on Wednesday. The surgeon said they will place an IV in my hand in order to knock me out for the surgery. I had bilateral mast. Oct 20th, had 23 lymph nodes removed from left arm, and 16 nodes removed from my right arm. I am right handed. I told the surgeon I was concerned about hand IV and possible lymphedema. He said he doesn't do feet sticks and couldn't do jugular IV because that is the area he will be inserting the port into. My arms still hurt 3.5 weeks post surgery and I really want to avoid lymphedema if at all possible. I've spoken to two nurses who both say it isn't a thing to worry about since the IV won't be in for very long, but I'm still concerned.  Still, I'm concerned about the pressure from the band used and also the actual IV stick itself. Am I worrying myself crazy for no real reason? I just don't want to deal with the arm pains I currently have, the hard time I have finding a comfortable sleep position, the side effects of chemo and then lymphedema all at the same time.
Thanks for your comments.

							Hi JM....I don't blame you for being concerned about this.  I have had only one breast removed, my left one, 4 years ago.  I had 15 nodes taken, all negative.  My heart goes out to you.  I have often thought what would I do if I got cancer in my right breast and nodes were removed.  This is a terrible position to be put in.  So far, I have not had any swelling.

I don't have many comforting words for you.  I think I would ask every question I could think of to the surgeon about where to put that IV.  Seems like I have read somewhere that they can put it in other places, especially since you have had nodes removed from both sides.

I also had a port...and I am so glad I did.  I would recommend it to anyone having chemo.  But your case is special.  I can't comment on what the nurses told you.  I know they know more than I do.  Having said that, I also know the medical establishment does not take lymphedema questions as seriously as I think it should.  Maybe Leo can help more if he reads your post in time.

Good Luck to you...you will be in my thoughts and prayers

							Hi JM,

I am 8 1/2 years NED on one side and 4 years NED on the other.  I NEVER let anyone use my arms for anything.  If your surgeon doesn't do foot sticks, then ask him to have someone else do it.  Lymphedema can appear any time, days, weeks and even years after node removal.  There is a website you can get free bright pink LE (lymphedema) bracelets to wear on each arm every time you need lab tests or have a procedure.  I'll post the address if I can find it, MNLady might have it if she sees this thread.

LE is no fun and I don't blame you for being paranoid.  Yes, it is a huge pain in the patootie to get your BP done on your leg and all bloodwork, etc from foot samples and frankly people just don't like to do it.  They, however, are not the ones who may end up wearing a compression sleeve, using a pneumatic pump to get the darn thing on.  I'm personally not willing to take the chance so I stick to my guns.

On the topic of foot sticks.... I have two tips - 1 - have them use a 'baby' iv, it takes a little longer to get a sample but is a lot less painful; I usually call ahead to the lab to make sure they have some. 2 - There is an over-the-counter cream you can get that numbs the skin.  It helps.

BTW, I do have LE myself, just not in my arms.  As soon as I could get my arms up over my head, I'd elevate them numerous times a day, for a few minutes at a time.

Good luck with your port surgery.  Sorry you had to join the club none of us wants to belong to.

							I am in a small city in Ontario, and am having a mastectomy on Friday the 19th, with some node removal. (sentinal biopsy is not an option here )and would have to do it in Toronto or Hamilton, which would mean waiting, and seeing as how my cancer is aggressive,and  invasive, the sooner I have the mast, the better.
The surgeon said the only thing he didn't want me to do post -op, was to put my arm up high, over my head., but recommended circular movement exercise, at body level.
Is this what any ladies did post=op?

							I can't help but post on this question.  

Dr. Leo, with all due respect you have given information that is incorrect, or at the very least ambiguous and at the very worst, you have trivialized the issue of lymphedema.  There are enough doctors, nurses, lab techs, and anthesiologists out here already giving the wrong advice on this subject.

Lymphedema is a real concern.  It is not a phobia.  It is a lifetime risk which can happen at anytime in one's lifetime if the lymphatic system has been disturbed.  Physical Therapists trained in treating and preventing this horrible incurable condition would be cringing at your comment.

Shame on the medical profession for expecting us to be so self-informed and responsible for our own ""health prevention"" measures when we don't even get the truth from the very professionals we naturally turn to for advice.

A little more homework on your part is needed in this area if you are going to give such ambiguous comments.  

Just who is this forum helping?  As for Doctors saying they don't ""Do"" foot or ankle sticks... BS!  Call in a surgical nurse if you need to... they know how to do them!

Ladies, do not let the uninformed medical professionals tell you that it is ok to get I.V.'s, blood drawn, or any needle in the affected arm.  Or that it's only important to be vigilent for a year, or just a little while or any other such nonsense.  

It is your life and the quality of that life after BC is your responsibility.  Lymphedema and the possibility of it occuring is a real concern.

Shame--shame--shame!  Have you ever seen a BC survivor with Lymphedema?  Once it gets to a certain stage it never, never goes away.  It is ugly, it is painful and it is something that can be prevented.

Seek out a Certified Physical Therapist who will be much more informed and will give better information than what was offered here.

							Ah, JM, what a bad spot we find ourselves in!  I must agree with the other women who have posted here.  If the surgeon can't do it in your foot, ask him to make arrangements with someone who can.  Ask nicely, say please--but don't take no for an answer.

I've had two mastectomies, have LE in chest and one arm and hand.  My second surgeon scoffed at the idea of not using an affected arm.  Old-fashioned thinking, he said.  No evidence that blood pressure or IVs can cause LE.  Just so you know, though, the ""no evidence"" only means no research has been done, not that research shows it does no harm.  And until we have that research evidence, we all need to go by the best (and only) evidence we have, which is from patients and LE therapists.  Because LE can appear at any point for the rest of our lives, it stands to reason surgeons and even oncologists don't have much handle on how many of their patients eventually must face it.

Dr. Leo, please do look into this further.  Talk to a variety of LE therapists.  In fact, invite a couple of them to address a group of oncologists and surgeons at your hospital.  I'm aware that the training in LE is lacking in medical schools, and that research has been spotty at best.  But those of us at risk deserve the best prevention efforts possible, because this condition is life-long, is intensive to manage and control, and certainly saps a whale of a lot of quality from lives already compromised by cancer.  What those of us who've posted here would like best of all would be if you, Dr. Leo, would become an advocate among professionals for taking LE seriously.  In fact, if you'd like, I can introduce you to any number of women with LE who will tell you in clear terms that the struggle with LE is in many ways more devastating to them than the original cancer.  This is the absolute truth, with no paranoia involved.

I'm fairly new to LE (since May), so maybe my tears are understandable, but I've met women who've been treating their LE for 15 years who are still suffering bouts of deep unhappiness at regular intervals.  There is no cure, it never gets easy, and this is no small thing.

Thanks, Dr. Leo, for creating this board, and thanks especially for your desire to hear us and learn from our experiences.  In this matter of LE, we all look forward to a time when all those women who still face it will have access to the best care possible.

Thanks,

							This is my first post here.  I am looking for some advice as to what type of doctor is need to see.  I have a history of endometrial cancer with total hysterectomy almost a year ago.  I also completed 25 radiation treatments in April 04.  No chemo.  I had a CT scan in June 04 which showed a small nodule in my right middle lung.  They sent me for a PET scan which came back with a benign result.  I was told it was probably scar tissue and nothing to worry about.  Everything was fine until my gyn/onc sent me for a routine follow-up CT of the pelvis, abdomen, and chest which revealed the mass in my right middle lobe had trippled in size in about 3 months.  That was about a month ago.  Since then, I was referred to a pulmonologist who did a broncoscopic biopsy which only showed inflammation, a needle biopsy which did not reveal evidence of malignancy.  They sent the needle biopsy out to Anderson Cancer Center in Texas, but they were not able to rule out malignancy either because there was not enough of a sample to make a diagnosis.    I was back at the pulmonologist again today who did a chest x-ray.  Apparently the mass is not getting any smaller, and he wants to send me to a thoracic surgeon to remove the mass.  The pulmonary doctor actually wanted me to have this major surgery in 2 days.  I thought this was strange since he doesn't know what it is.  I'm wondering if I should see a general oncologist first to see what their recommendation is.  I have an appointmnet with the thoracic surgeon this week to discuss the surgery. 
I feel like this pulmonologist has no experience in dealing with cancer.  I don't know what to do.  Please help.
						

"

							Hello

As it sounds like they have tried to get biopsies and could not elucidate the diagnosis, usually the next step is an open biopsy through a toracoscopy. I think a pulmonologist would be exactly the specialist you would like to talk to, because they work up lung nodules and masses, and talk to surgeons to arrange for surgeries. You can ask him to talk to your oncologist, but I think a pulmonologist would be the specialist I'd like to see if I had the same problem.

							I have an uncle that has been diagnosed with lung cancer.  My father just told me yesterday.  According to my father, he has a tumor in his lung that is wrapped around a main artery in his chest.  I did some research and I believe that he has a tumor wrapped around the vein in the chest that brings the blood from the upper body back to the heart.  I think my uncle went to the hospital because his face had swollen up a lot.  They are giving him radiation treatment to try to shrink the tumor so that it can be removed.  If this fails he will die.

Mom has not had any problems with lymphedema, but has recently developed a lump about the size of my palm on her side just below her armpit.

Maybe the oncologist thought that it would not change the course of things, since she already has metastatic disease to the brain. I am just thinking that that may be the case, just wondering.

Mom had a chest/pelvis CT, head MRI, and bone scan in late Sept. and they were all clean!  Would it have been possible to see evidence of axillary recurrence on the CT?  

Mom is cancer free at the moment (according to the recent tests), so shouldn't the oncologist at least determine whether or not this could be a recurrence?

Mom can't speak for herself since the stroke, so I do my best to ask the right questions.

I saw it on the mammogram and it was spiculated.  What I have read about it is that it always is a sign of malignancy.  Is this true?

While spiculated lesions on mammogram raise red flags, they are not always malignant. But there is a good chance it might be.

							Hi, 
I have had a lumpectomy but further surgery recommended to take one more section where further calcifications show. 
I would like to go to radiation therapy after surgery but am hearing from plastic surgeon that burning of skin and hardess of tissue may result and section where tissue has been taken will sink down to chest wall and look pretty ugly. Has anyone proceeded with radiation and what were the results in similar case? The surgeon and plastic surgeon recommend a mastectomy. 12 years ago I had mastectomy and implant on other side.

							Hi Norah,

Sorry you are going through this again.  I've had partial mast's on both sides, with rads.  One side is just fine, the other has a divit   LE on both sides (ugh).

Did you have a SNB with your lumpectomy or are they doing an axilla dissection when they do your wide excision? (sorry, chemobrain destroyed whatever little spelling ability I once had...lol).  I think the radiation damage they are talking about is directly related to how much tissue they plan to remove and where it is.

Why are they recommending a mast?  Would you still have to have rads if you have one?

Here are the things I'd consider, in deciding which route to go:

Wide excision - healing time before rads - usually 4 to 6 weeks; rads, depending on how many - 4 to six weeks; recovery from rads 6 months or more depending on your current health and how well you tolerate tx.  Physical end result - possibly ""pretty ugly"" to quote the surgeon.  Did they say if they could do anything to make it look better after healing?  I'm guessing they won't touch it.

Mastectomy - healing time from week 4 you'll feel better and better, the first 10 days you are sore, but that's why they have drugs.  (My friend had a double mast in late May and in Sep the day she finished rads went on a 2 week training course, came back packed up and moved south to a new job.)  Healing time will also depend on which procedure you get, tram or lat flap takes longer, mast with expanders which are later changed out to implants takes less healing time.  There are also variables like how much they are taking, and whether or not you'll still need rads.  The healing time with rads is about the same either way, and they will fill the expander before they start rads.  If you don't have rads the expanders are usually changed out in 3-6 months, depending on your body.  With rads, the healing time is a little longer.  Physical result - most likely pretty good (you'll never have to worry about droop and both sides will match). 

In the 12 years since your first mast they've come a long way.  I have a few friends who have had them, some with reconstructs, others without.

It is a completely personal decision, because only you know how your body works and what is important to you.  We all react to the surgeries and treatment so differently.  Ask your doctors all the questions you need to so you can make the best decision for you.  Let us know how things are progressing.

Cheers,

							Hi, Norah, Bree has given you a lot of good advice and information. I had a lumpectomy with radiation in 1996. I have a divot where the lumpectomy was, but that is due to a a post-surgical infection. I did have some burning of the skin during radiation and some of the skin broke down and peeled. But it healed. Eventually the redness faded to a tan and even that just about disappeared. My breast was pretty firm during rads, but it too has recovered and is squishy again. What has remained is extreme sensativity in the nipple. Maybe it is psycological, but it seems overly sensative to any stimulation.  Sorry to get this explicit. Good luck to you.

							My doctors have been watching my ""good"" breast for over six months now.  An MRI last spring had some areas of enhancement that were recommended for follow up in 6 months.  So, last month I had a follow up MRI, which came back ""suspicious for malignancy.""  My doctor suggested I repeat the MRI at a different point in my cycle, which I did this week.  Now it has come back as ""probably benign"" areas of enhancement, with follow up in 6 months recommended.  I'd like to relax, but I just don't feel very confident.  I'm wondering, how long are these kinds of things usually followed?  Will I be following these areas every 6 months for the rest of my life?  Is it possible for an MRI to miss a cancer?  I haven't spoken to my own doctor, since he's out this week and another doctor whom I've never met called me.  This doctor didn't sound at all familiar with my case, and didn't put me at ease over this situation.  I am afraid I will worry for the entire next 6 months.  Any info or insight appreciated.

							Hello

Difficult situation. Even though you can have a benign or malignant lesion, these situations are done when patients want to avoid going in for a biopsy, which has all the risks and all... but you should express your concerns to your doctor, and if you are willing to get the area biopsied, it may help you answer your question at once.

							Hi,
The waiting is such a hard thing to do especially once we've had BC.  My thinking is don't wait.  Get the incisional biopsy done and if it's B9, which I'm praying it is, you can relax.  If it's not, then you can get a jump on things.  The last thing you want to do IF it is cancer again, is give it more time to grow.  The only good lump, is one in a jar.
Please keep us posted.

							Hello to MuttsMom and thank you for recommending this board.     

I was diagnosed with invasive lobular carcinoma recently and since then I've had all the normal tests...mammograms, ultrasounds, MRI, CT scan and I'm going for a bone scan on Friday.   I found this problem when I noticed a swollen lymph node under my right arm and went to my local doctor.  That was about 1 month ago.  I'm going for a bone scan on Friday and then to Moffitt Cancer Center on Monday.  I'm hoping they will do SOMETHING quick!!  

Now here's my question....and I know I'm sounding paranoid here....my upper right arm has been bothering me.  At first I thought it was a muscle problem now I'm not sure.  When my doctor scheduled me for a bone scan, it really started to bother me.  I'm wondering if it's all psychological.  Now I'm freaked out thinking the cancer has spread to my bones.  In my head, I know I'm overreacting but I just can't help it.  ANyone ever have this problem?

							Hello

Thanks for posting. Seems like you are getting good care. Even though I have not been through the experience of being diagnosed with cancer, I can only imagine how anxiety-provoking it can be. The only advice I have for you is to try to find ways to relax and be assured that your doctors are working with you in your best interest. I know it is hard, but that's all you can do for now. You can always talk to other women here about what you are going through, there are so many good people around...

							Hi Shelly,
I'm glad you came and posted here.  I really like it, the help is great and no cat fights.....lol
I think we'll always have worries when something hurts that never did before and in reality, it probably always hurt on and off but never thought anything of it and now, we think BC right off.  This is all so new to you and I will say that after time, when you hurt, even though your 1st thought is BC, you don't panic like in the beginning.  I think I told you that I had pain in my right hip and when I went for my regular check up, I told my onco about it.  He felt it was the Arimidex but since I was Stage III and I hadn't had a bone scan in over a year, he ordered one.  Everything was fine, not even degenerative (sp) changes showed up on my hip.  Last week, my left hip started hurting and the only thing that saved me was knowing I had a bone scan last month.  In about 2 weeks, it went away.  Please let me/us know how your scan goes.  I had a bone density test and it showed osteoporsis (I should learn how to spell it since I have it... lol) in my right hip and other places.  I'm now on Actonel to strengthen my bones.
Always listen to your body and if the anxiety gets bad, make an appt. for peace of mind.  When my mammogram showed ""normal"" my gut told me that something wasn't right because of the large lump I found and I listened to my gut thank God.  Now, it's harder to know if your gut is right or the fear of BC again, but when in doubt, get things checked.  It's alway such a HUGE relief to hear, everything looks good 
You're in my prayers and I'm sure others will respond to your post as well as our wonderful Dr Leo.  E-mail me anytime, I'm here

							Hi Shelly,

Sorry to hear about your dx.  Dr. Leo is a real sweetie, isn't he.  He's right, you are getting all the normal tests for starters.  The very best advice I can give you is ""Don't worry until you have something to worry about.""  Easy to say, a little more difficult to do, I know.  

Take this time between appointments, scans and tests to get yourself organized.  I recommend getting yourself a binder or an expanding file and setting your medical 'stuff' up like a business.  If you look at the process of getting your body back to health as a business it becomes much easier to handle all the details.  Your binder/file should have a calendar for appointments, sections for results (I get copies of everything from bloodwork to surgical to oncology and pathology reports); medical insurance info, research you do, and notes from doctors appointments.  On more than one occasion I walked into 'the next appointment' for a test they needed other results that they hadn't yet received and were about to reschedule when I went into my file and handed them what they needed.

Hearing someone tell you ""You have breast cancer"" is a heart stopping, all-your-breath-sucked-out-of-you experience.  It is normal to go through a myriad of reactions from numb to sobbing (sometimes in the blink of an eye).  We all have our own unique ways of handling it and you'll find yours as you go along.  I choose to laugh wherever and whenever possible.

If you have questions, ask away.  I'm pretty new here but this seems to be a really nice group of people.

							Hi Shelly;

I had a melanoma about 10 years ago and for the 1st five years I went for checkups every 3, then every 6 months.  Each time, about a month before, I started to feel tingling under my arms. My family doctor had to send me for a cardiac stress test, it was so bad.

It was all in my head.  Strange thing, our minds.

Now, my wife has lobular, and when I reminded her of this she admitted her underarms were bothering her as well.

BTW, lobular is different than ductal in many ways. Because it doesn't show up well on mamograms, it is usually found when it is at a later stage. My wife's ""first-blush"" diagnosis was a 1cm tumor. It turned out to be 2.1cm and eventually stage III. 10 of 14 lymph nodes were positive.

This would normally be bad news, but the good news is that recent studies show that in spite of being found at a later stage, lobular long term statistics are better than ductal.

Try not to be anxious. This is terribly difficult to do, but the best advice I have is to take the anxious thought as it pops into your mind and replace it with something lovely. It works but requires practice to intercept the thought before it takes root and grows.

							Hi, Shelly, I know just how you feel. It seems like after diagnosis we worry about every ache and pain. Bree's advice about trying not to worry until you know you have something to worry about, is good. It is advice I and friends of mine (also BC survivors) pass on to others we meet. I don't think the axiety ever goes away completely. Even after 8 years I still worry about my annual mammogram and blood tests that the onc orders done. I don't relax until I hear that everything is normal.   So, good luck with that bone scan. Here's hoping it shows nothing more serious than a little arthritis.

							Hi Patti,

Something like 80% of breast lumps are benign.  Having said that, any lump you find should be investigated.  Your first step should be to go to your PCP for an exam, then, depending on your age, for a mammogram or ultrasound.  I am a firm believer in biopsies.  Mammo's & US are diagnostic tools and they are good, but the only way to know for sure is to have a biopsy.  There are a number of different types, most are easliy done and not terribly painful.  Good luck and let us know how things turn out.

							Hi Patti,
I totally agree with everything that Bree said.  I was 43 when I was dx with Stage III, Invasive Lobular BC.  Of course, this doesn't mean that you will get a dx like mine and yours could very well be B9, but never let anyone tell you that you're '"" too young"".  
The only thing I can add to Bree's post is I'm President of the Whimp Club .... lol  The incisional biopsy was the 1st surgery since I was 3 years old and I can honestly say that there was really no pain to speak of.  The incision site was sore, but other then that I was really surprised how easy it was.  The only good lump is one in a jar.
Definately go see a doctor and get a biopsy.  If that one says no, wait and see, find another one.  Waiting isn't going to do you any good, regardless of how the biopsy turns out.  IF, and chances are good, it's B9, take a deep breath and celebrate, IF it's breast cancer, get a jump on it and go kick some cancer butt.
Hugs and prayers

							Patti, I'll add another vote to those of Bree and Nancy for a biopsy. Any lump needs to be taken seriously, and the best way to find out is an excisional biopsy. It is not a difficult procedure and you will be back on your feet the same day. Like Bree said, 80 percent, or fiour of every five, breast lumps are NOT cancer. So the odds are on you side. Good luck. Please keep us posted, caring people are here for you. Hugs, Lauri (8 yrs 7 months)

							Can someone please tell me if it would be detrimental to stop taking Tamoxifen after 3 years rather than 5? I have a call in to my oncologist but I am weighing the benefits of continuing to take Tamoxifen vs. the fatigue, memory loss, mood swings etc.  I was diagnosed at 27 but it was only Stage 1, and I did 6 cycles of AC.  Thank you.

							Hi Bernadette,

As you probably know, BC in young women (under 35) can be very aggressive and for that reason you would get lots of benefit from continuing to take something.  I thought of the aromatase inhibitors and trying one of those but you have to be postmenopausal.  Talking to your doc is a really good idea.

							I was dx when I was 43 with Stage III.  Had I been stage I, even though I'd be high risk, because under 50 is considered ""young"", I honestly believe I would keep taking the Tamoxifen.  With you being in your 20's, my strong opinion is not to stop taking it.  I don't mean to sound meladramtic, but if there is a choice of some unpleasantness from the Tamoxefin vs. a reoccurence, I'd definately pink the unpleasantness.  I take Arimidex, because chemo put me into MENTALpause (that fits so much better..lol)  Arimidex can and in most women causes hot flashes and severe bone and joint pain.  There are mornings I wake up feeling like I'm 100 until I can get myself moving.  I've had to have a bone scan because the pain in my hip was so bad, I just knew it was bone mets, but it wasn't thank God, it was the side affect of Arimidex.  Do I like feeling like this, no way, but I choose this and pray it prevents a reoccurence to stopping it and it coming back.
Just my opinion

							Hi Bernadette,

I was also stage I at diagnosis although I was 41 and I was still pre-menopausal and I remain that way even after chemo and Tamoxifen.

I made it 2 years, 3 months on Tamoxifen.  The side effects were affecting my quality of life too much.  My oncologist told me that although 5 years is standard, the most important was the first 2 years.  I'm choosing to believe her because I hated Tamoxifen.  I understand Nancy's statement about facing unpleasantness rather than recurrance, but only YOU can determine if it's merely unpleasant or truly affecting your quality of life enough to stop taking it.

Let's face it - there are no guarantees.  I recommend you talk to your oncologist.  Get a thorough understanding as to the aggressiveness of your cancer and your probabilities of recurrance and then weigh that with your quality of life.  For me, part of the problem was that every time I thought I had a handle on the side effects, a new one would appear.  I know it's a tough decision.  

Good luck.

							I didn't want anyone to think I was making light of the side affects or quality of life.  I guess what I should have said was that no matter what stage, early or late a reoccurence can happen with or without Tamoxefin, Arimidex or one of the others and of course some ladies are er/pr- and don't have the options we do.  I never meant it to sound like your quality of life wasn't important.  For me, if a drug would give me the best chance to have a LONG life, then I could handle and do the side affects, and the meds aren't for the rest of your life.  If it gave me a chance to have 40 more years, then 5 years would be worth it for me.

							Hello

The clinical trials were mostly done with women taking 3 and 5 years of tamoxifen. After a long debate, it was felt that 5 years would give the most benefit, BUT the additional benefit after 3 years is not enormous, but definitely there. So if you tolerate 5 years, that's the best route.

							Hi everyone,
Thanks for all of your well wishes and the comments on my lympedema-phobia post. The anestesiologist tried to put an IV in my foot one time but the vein collapsed. He said he would not poke around any more and put it very low, almost at the knuckle area, in my right hand. I had the port put in and the IV taken out. So far so good from a lymphedema stand point. I am however allergic to adhesives and I have blisters all over the wound site from where they covered the port and insertion areas with bandages. I guess I'll have to write in a big marker across my chest that I have this allergy since when I tell people about it, they seem to forget it at bandage time. So, I'm back on pain killers more for the blisters than the port insertion surgery. I start my first round of chemo at 1pm this Monday. I'm nervous but also ready for the fight. I hope the blisters clear up before the chemo side effects kick in.
Thanks again to everyone for your concerns.

							Brava, JM!  Sounds like you did manage to get the lymphedema awareness across, even if your veins wouldn't cooperate.  SO SORRY about the adhesive allergy.  The blisters are like burns--very painful, hard to wear any clothes at all.  I have the same problem and also have a hard time making doctors aware of it.  I've purchased some ""wipes"" called Skin-Prep (made by Smith-Nephew) at the drug store, and they do seem to help protect my skin when there's tape involved (though they're not fool-proof and the tape needs to be removed as soon as possible).  Of course, you do still have to convince the medical folks to use them--not so easy to supervise when you're anesthetized!

You're in my prayers as you start chemo.  It's an extreme sport, for sure, and it sounds like you're psyched for it.  Your nervousness provides an adrenaline burst that athlete's use to ready themselves for the win!

After living with horrendous menopausal symptoms for more than a year (at about year 6 of 7 year menopause process), I asked my gyn to evaluate a bump feeling in one of my breasts.  I was shocked that his treatment is so matter-of-factly a rushed appointment with a breast surgern .  The diagnostic mammogram caused some additional symptoms that I had not experienced during the gyn's exam, such as severe pain during mammo compression and the technician alerted me to a white discharge from nipples.My breasts are very small,flat-chested and not much to photograph.  My frustration leaves me with questions now, is the discharge normal for a woman whos last pregnancy was 16 years ago and in midst of menopause.?  Last period was 2 years ago.  The mammogram did not show any kind of mass or lump, which the doctor seemed so sure of to rush me to a surgeon as his treatment plan.  I am hesitant to pursue the appt with surgeon if what I have is simply mastitis or infection. I have left gyn message about my questions, which he has not answered!  Should I get a 2nd opinion from another gyn?
He has not convinced me 'Yet"" that this is a tumor that requires cutting open my chest.   Tell me about breast infection, like in the duct .  What are the symptoms for infection?  ThanksP
						

"

							Hi,

Some tumors do not show up on mammos, especially if the breasts are dense.  Have you had an  ultrasound and/or MRI?  I think I would go that route first.   If you feel a lump or thickening and it does not show up on a mammo, it definitely should be investigated further.  

Regarding the nipple discharge - I don't know because I've never had any.  But I do believe that all nipple discharge should be checked out.  I also believe that an infection in the breast/nipple would be resolved with an antibiotic.

Sorry I couldn't be of more help.  I'm sure Dr. Leo will explain.

							Hi, I guess I would want the discharge checked out. Doesn't sound ""normal"" to me. A good Web site to visit is imaginis.com for good information regarding breast health.

It is the best way to get positive answers. Take care and keep us posted. Lauri

							I'm not trying to scare you, but my mammogram missed a 5.5 cm tumor.  I use to feel at ease after I had one, that I was safe for another year, but the fact is, according to the info I got from the ACS is that mammograms miss 45% of all breast cancer in women under 50 and 35% of those over 50.  I had just turned 43.  My gut told me something wasn't right and I pushed it and found out I had Stage III BC with the large tumor and 9 positive lymph nodes out of 16.  Had I not listened to my gut, I have no doubt I wouldn't have been here today, the only stage after III is 4.

The only good lump is one that is in a jar.  If your doc doesn't want to persue it, find another one.

Don't get me wrong, it could VERY likely be B9 but it's not worth taking any chances.  Get a ultra sound (mine was misread, but I'm sure that isn't the norm).  The only way to know for sure is with a biopsy.

Take care and keep us posted.

							I just want to say that I agree with all the others.  I don't mean to scare you but any lump should be checked out, especially if the mammo does not pick it up.  I had a 1.5 cm (pea size) that I felt and you could see and the mammo didn't pick that up.  The surgeon didn't even want to biopsy it, he just wanted it out and thank GOD he did.
I also want to inform you all that you should get copies of the mammo report. Like someone else said here, I got the OK and felt I was safe for another year, however when I actually read all my mammo's from age 35..I am 42 now...I was shocked because I felt if I had been informed that the only reason I was given the OK each year was only because the severe denseness of my breast made it impossible to see anything.
My point is, I had no clue about dense breasts and if I had been I would have been more diligent about self checking. 
I am not sure about nipple discharge but would have it checked out regardless.  I hope it all turns out well for you!

							Hello

If you have a nodule, you still could have and ultrasound, maybe it is a cyst. Breast discharge is not normal especially in a post-menopausal woman. This definitely needs evaluation, not necessarily a biopsy right away, but maybe some more imaging before the biopsy.

Angiosarcoma is not tipically linked to cancers that run in families.

							Hi,
I had no family history of breast cancer or any other cancer for that matter and my mammogram also came back ""negative for cancer"" but I could feel the lump/mass.  The only way to be sure is with a biopsy and thank God I pushed for one.  I was only a couple of years older then you when I was dx 2/02.  Sadly, there is no such thing as too young and family history, according to the last ACS report I saw only accounted for 10-15% of all BC.
As my saying goes, the only good lump is one in a jaw.  You need to find out one way or another and I'll be praying it's B9 and then you can relax!

							If you feel a lump, it can be biopsied.  Mammograms are far from perfect, but definately worth getting every year because it does find 1/2.  As I said, I felt the lump/mass but the mammogram was negative and the ultra sound said that it was 2, 1cm B9 cysts.  I knew what I felt was one of whatever it was.  I had to call my family doc and tell her I wanted to see a surgeon.  Here, you don't have to have a referral to see one, but check with your insurance.

							The same thing has just happened to me.  I happened to do a quick self exam and felt a lump.  My OB/GYN saw me 2 days later and confirmed a breast mass.  I asked him if it was possibly a cyst and he said he didn't know.  The U/S or Mammo would confirm if it was w/liquid or solid.  The Mammo and U/S came out negative and the U/S tech came in and said we were done and everything was negative to follow up with my doctor.  I did and he referred me to a general surgeon for additional opinions.  He said the surgeon would be better at guiding me to the next step and we coul decide together what that would be.  Once in a while in the past few months (this may sound weird) I have to look down at my right breast (same breast I found the lump) because sometimes I swear I just leaked something out and it gets cold (only this breast).  When I look there's usually nothing there though.  Not sure what that means. Frustrating.

							I have been on Tamoxifen for 3.5 years after having been diagnosed with stage 1 invasive breast cancer.  At age 50, I was premenopausal and with my cancer 98% ER+, I went on Lupron for 18 months.  Since then, my E2 and FSH levels indicate that I'm post-menopausal.    This summer at 3yrs, I started spotting 4-5 days per week.  An endometrial biopsy said there was no cancer.   I should mention that I had an endometrial ablation in 1991 and therefore any procedure is complicated by that.  They attempted a sonohysterogram but were only marginally successful because of the scar tissue.  My gynocologist recommended that my oncologist switch me to one of the aromatase inhibitors instead of Tamoxifen which my oncologist agreed.  I started arimidex this week.

However, I am not comfortable that there is no cancer.  How accurate is an endometrial biopsy?  Can I be sure that it is sampling the correct area?  Wouldn't having my uterus removed solve all the problems... stop the bleeding and answer my questions.  Am I overreacting because of previous cancer diagnosis?  Any answers would be greatl appreciated.

							Hi,

From what info I have been reading on various internet sites, I am getting the impression that once I undergo my chemo treatments, I will be put into menopause, and considered post menopausal. Does this sound correct? I start dose dense chemo this afternoon, four rounds A/C over the next 8 weeks followed by 4 rounds taxol over another 8 weeks. I just turned 45 a few weeks ago. Had hysterectomy in 1998 for fibroids and endometriosis. Just wondering if anyone was told that, since I've seen it posted that way on the Internet.

							Hi Jan,
I had just turned 43 when I was dx and I never had a period after my 1st chemo.  The onco thought they would come back, but after 6 months (after chemo was done) it didn't come back and he did a blooc test and chemo had put me into MENTALpause.
It doesn't happen to everyone, but yes, it can happen and it did with me.

I read that the closer you are to a natural menopausal age, the more the likelihood that the chemo will induce menopause.  For example, someone who is forty-five is more likely to be put into chemo-induced menopause than someone who is 32.

							I'm 47.. will be 48 exactly on the day of round #4 of A/C, and just finished round #2 of my chemotherapy.  I started my period (normal) the week before my first treatment, and got it exactly 28 days later (normal).  My oncologist told me I would go into menopause too so I'm prepared either way.  I still have a total of six treatments to go.. two of the A/C and 4 Taxoterre.
						

"

							The closer you are, the more likely you will be permanently menopausal.

Due to the fact that I had 6 doctors (including 3 female doctors) that I saw at time of diagnosis and not a single one of them gave me any description of the difference in what menopause means for women who are about to experience it by chemical or surgical means (compared to what it means for those who experience it naturally), I will try to do that for you.

I was 50 at dx and pre or perimenopausal, and I was 51 at completion of chemo and rads. At completion despite the rigors of treatment I still felt some joy of life every day, and still had some ability to enjoy sex. 

My onc advised me to start tamoxifen. I said that I understood that tamoxifen was very drying, vaginally as well as just about everywhere else. He literally laughed at me and said that was not true.

Two weeks after starting tamoxifen my skin was dry, my eyes were dry, my vagina was dry, my sex life was dry, and my emotions were flat. I stopped the tamoxifen for 2 weeks and there was no change, so I restarted it in the belief that the damage was done and I could at least get the benefit of perhaps being among the 40-50% of women taking tamoxifen that tamoxifen might protect.

Since then I have spoken with my internist about this as well as the onc. This is a difficult subject to talk about with a male doctor but I did. Both responded that my testosterone level could be tested to see if adding testosterone was helpful, although it was doubtful. Otherwise they had absolutely no comment at all, other than my onc, who asked me why I was asking him this question and not my internist. Since chemotherapy does bring on menopause and for some reason there is no association in these doctors' minds with the impact of abrupt menopause on women, I don't think this onc really should be prescribing chemotherapy to women, even though he is at the top of his field.

They did not offer any counseling, or any referral for counseling. Each doc tested my testosterone, and neither of them ever told me what the results of the testosterone testing were. 

I want to describe what this change was like for me. To me it was the equivalent of having a lobotomy of the part of my brain that deals with the joy of life and the joy of sex.

I am using the E-string for lubrication for sex, along with lots of lubricant, since I have been with a great partner for over 30 years. Sex is now 80% accommodation, 20% pleasure.

This might be the worst-case scenario and not what will happen for you, but I wish someone would have said this to me so that I would have had better information BEFOREhand.

							Hi Leo. 

I was diagnosed with HER2+ bc at the end of 2001 and like most, had a lot to learn but little time to make decisions about treatment. Since then I have explored a number of bc ""decision guides/tools"" online. It seems to me that it is more than just a little hypocritical for oncs to routinely  recommend using chemo that includes an anthracycline for patients who are HER2+ and yet they can't come out of the closet to agree on that enough to put that criteria in the online decision guides. Has ASCO ever come out with a consensus statement on this? If so, why wouldn't it be included as part of the online decision guides?

It is deceptive not to include this in the decision guides, particularly since anthracylines pose some additional potential dangers. Why should we have to continue to rely on what each onc ""thinks"" and ""recommends"" if they aren't basing that on a consensus after considering what evidence there is?
						

"
"


							Hello

Thanks for your post. I agree with you that since the evidence is available, it should be applied uniformly to all patients. While that is true, there is so much that influences if a patient can receive more aggressive treatment that I think it is not possible to include in these decision guides.

For example, take bone marrow transplant for leukemia. Some doctors offer it to patients up to 45y, other go up to 50y and so on. It is the level of comfort that an individual doctor has with submitting a patient to a very aggressive treatment regimen. Another example, if an 85 yo woman who has very aggressive breast cancer is being evaluated, few would offer her aggressive chemotherapy with anthracyclines. But some would. Oncology is such a difficult field mainly because there are so many difficult decisions to make....

Guidelines or consensus are just that: a group of experts that come together an issue a statement. When there is controversy, guidelines are usually not issues because the is no consensus... 

Hope this helped !

regards,
Leo
						

"
"


							Thanks for the response, Leo. I know the reason for having decision guides in the first place is to try to explain and simplify the complicated nature of breast cancer. 

I still believe the decision guides for adjuvant treatment should at least reference the issue of HER2 and anthracyclines somewhere, because without that the results can be discordant with what most oncs would actually recommend, which tends to make one wonder if the onc they are seeing is out of touch or just tends to hand out the nastiest chemo as a rule of thumb.

							I recently joined this forum because I have a question and I don't really have another good place to ask this. My best friend recently told me that her boyfriend of over a year just informed her that he has had lymph node cancer for more than two years. What struck me as ""odd"" about the story was the fact that he has never been actually diagnosed by a doctor, he just knows he has it. He told her that he felt lumps, went to a specialist, and all the doctor told him was ""come back if it gets worse"" Now I'm not sure but I don't think if a doctor thought someone had cancer they would want to wait at all for it to get worse before they treat it. Then he told her that he has gotten weaker over the years and can ""feel his body dying"" He says that he doesn't want to go to a doctor becuase he doesn't want to be cut open and he thinks doctors are only out to take people's money. He thinks he is going to cure it from getting these mushrooms from somewhere in Asia that are supposed to cure cancer but doctors don't use them because then they wouldn't get money. My friend completely believes him and I really think that he's lying. I think he really feels he has cancer but he doesn't and I'm not really sure why. He also told her that he was supposed to be dead by last christmas but has kept himself alive by taking A LOT of vitamins. I just want to know if this is actually possible or if anyone has heard of these mushrooms. And if he doesn't have cancer how do I go about telling my friend. Also, I am the first person my friend has told about this and she said her boyfriend told her not to tell anyone becuase he didn't want people to feel sorry for him. I am really confused and I hope I can get some help here. Thanks for reading this, sorry if it's a little lengthy.

							Hello

A diagnosis of cancer in most cases will be made when you have a biopsy of something. Sometimes in very advanced cancers it is obvious that it is cancer. 

But what I think is happening is that your friend is afraid to go to the doctor, and is just believing that he has cancer. Whether he has it or not, I don't know. Also, there is no magic bullet for this, and these mushrooms are unlikely to have some effect. 

You should talk to your friend to tell him to visit a doctor to find out what he really has. He can then look at options for therapy.

							I think the boyfriend needs to see a doctor but one for his head.  That's crazy talk.  He probably does THINK he has cancer, but mushrooms or no mushrooms, you don't just walk around with cancer for years.  Sadly, I have had several friends get cancer this year.  It has been a bad year.  My best friend was diagnosed with stage 3 lymph node cancer  this past spring.  Six months before this he had a complete physical for work and was in perfect health (no cancer, nothing).  Six months later he was stage 3 in the ICU on oxygen so he could breath.  He did see a doctor when he got the first lump and they did give him antibiotics and told him to come back if the lump didn't go away.  It didn't go away, but he didn't go back to the doctor right away which is how he ended up in the ICU.   But this was WEEKS not YEARS.    I don't know if this is proof or not, but maybe it will convince them to get him some help.  He needs some kind of help because that is no way to live your life.  The boyfriend may have Munchowsen disease where someone thinks they are dying but they are not.  I saw it on a medical show recently.

							Hello and Welcome

There are many types of lymph cancer that are slow growing, they are called indolent lymphoma's. The most common treatment for these is in fact to wait and watch. These cancers are incurable, unless they turn into aggressive lymphomas which can then be treated. Although they are almost impossible to treat, they are rarely fatal, in fact you can have them for 40+ years and die from totally unrelated causes.

Maybe he has an indolent lymphoma and he is overly pessimistic? If he had an aggressive lymphoma he would be dead by now, as he has not had any treatment,  so he definitely does not have this.

If your friend loves this man any input from you , even if you consider it to be in her best interests, will be viewed as interference and you may lose your friend. Be careful

							Hello,

Currently I am 21 weeks pregnant and have a swollen lymph node in my right armpit. My doctor has told me that it could be lymphoma, but wants to wait for 2 months to see if the lymph node gets larger. He will not order a biopsy. I told him I am uncomfortable with waiting 2 months, but he insists there is nothing that can be done for lymphoma while pregnant anyway. First of all, I am wondering if lymph nodes often swell during pregnancy and end up being non-cancerous. I am also wondering if there are treatment options for lymphoma during pregnancy. Of course I am cursed with an HMO until January, after which I will have access to more doctors with a PPO health plan. Is it safe to wait so long for a biopsy? Psychologically, I am not doing so well not knowing what is going on with my body. Thanks for listening.

							Hello

Any treatment for lymphoma during pregnancy is contraindicated. Your lymph node in the axilla can be benign as well. Also, if you are not having symptoms such as fevers, night sweats, weight loss, it is less likely that it is lymphoma. During pregnancy it is extremely complicated to make decisions like that. Different doctors may have different opinions.

I told him I am uncomfortable with waiting 2 months, but he insists there is nothing that can be done for lymphoma while pregnant anyway. First of all, I am wondering if lymph nodes often swell during pregnancy and end up being non-cancerous. I am also wondering if there are treatment options for lymphoma during pregnancy. Of course I am cursed with an HMO until January, after which I will have access to more doctors with a PPO health plan. Is it safe to wait so long for a biopsy? Psychologically, I am not doing so well not knowing what is going on with my body. Thanks for listening.

							Okay, I still have a lot of work to do with the Doctors, but I am really wondering if it is worthwhile.  I has a slightly elevated PSA.  If I understand the doctor correct, 40% is the cut off point and I have a 43.  Also my colon screening came back with a little blood in it. 

I am also looking at the cancers from a unique prospective.  Almost every where I look, the medical field is talking about fighting it.  What if I want to pass naturally and as soon as possible?

Frankly, I have never been a happy camper.  If I could pass away tonight in my sleep that would be fine with me.  On the other hand, I am not going to take my own life. And I am definitely into avoiding pain.

If I elect, to live out my days with these cancers rather then fighting them, about how long do I have?  What will my life be like?  Will there be much pain?  

I avoided the excesses of my father.  I never drank much and I never smoked.  He died of lung cancer.  He got along fine until they gave him the chemo and he was bed ridden for a year until his death.  He looked like a walking skeleton.   Yet somehow, I think if I had my life to live again, and knowing I was going to end up like this... well, I would drink, smoke, whore around, and cuss up a storm.  It ain't fair.  I have done a reasonable job of maintaining this body.  My family history has lots of people living to ripe old ages - over 100 years when our neighbors were only living to 35- 40.

I would rather die doing something I love than go the way my father  did.    If I stand a chance of being in extreme pain, I would rather be a daredevil while I still can.

							You don't say how old you are in your post, but if you want to die peacefully in your sleep, prostate cancer is not the way to go.  My husband's uncle died of this and it was not pleasant.  It got into the bones in his back, and he was in a lot of pain and paralyzed for the last few months.  He had to have surgery just so he could pee cause the cancer blocked him up.  The doctors said if they had caught it earlier, he could have had surgery or radiation and been cured.   He hated doctors and refused to see one until he was in a lot of pain and by then it was too late.   They gave him lots of pain medicine, but it didn't help much.   It was sad to see him like that.   I hope you will go see your doctor soon and see if they can help you before it is too late.

Okay, I am 52. Well, I am seeing the Doctors at the VA.  They are slow to schedule, but I will see one on the 20th here and have a colonoscopy scheduled for next month.   I am also planning on jumping out of a perfectly good airplane, flyiing an ultra-light  around the city,  and going out and have my first and probably only good drunk.  Heck, I might go across the border to Juarez and have a good old time.
I figure I cannot hurt anything if the old bod is giving out this early in life.  I thought I had a good 1/3 of it left.

							I'm glad to hear you are following up on things with the VA doctors.  Yes, they are slow to get things done, and it is frustrating having to wait when you just want the cancer gone.   But please stick with it.  You are way too young to be giving up.  Your body is not giving out on you.  It is just giving you a little wake up call to get on with life and plan how you are going to be spending that 1/3 you have left.  I highly recommend jumping out of a perfectly good airplane.  Have fun partying in Juarez.  Take up a new hobby.  Live like every day is your last day.  Get busy enjoying yourself.  Remember:  No day but this day!

							Since august i've suffering from telogen effluvium (hair loss)  because of this  i've had several blood tests and a mammogram and sonogram of the breast and pelvis. according to the results i have a benign tumor in my left breast. I've haven't had any further testing and i don't  know whether to trust my doctor when he tells me not to worry about it. Im psyched already from my sudden hair loss, thanks to God, its gradually stopping, but this experience has me realize how fragil we are. I have a friend who was told by a dermatologist that the white patches on her skin were allergies, but now a year later, she has been diagnosed with skin cancer in the first stage. Im 22 years old , no history of cancer in my family, i eat healthy, exercise regularly. Can anybody tell me according to their experience , what can i do? Also, is there any difference bt a tumor and a lump?

							Hi,
Without a biopsy, they can't tell for certain if a tumor/lump is B9 or not.  I had no history of any kind of cancer in my family and I was dx Stage III BC.  It's not common for someone your age to have BC, BUT it's not impossible.  If they found a lump on the mammogram or ultra sound, then they could biopsy it to be sure it's nothing.  More then likely it is not breast cancer, but you can never say never.  I personally would ask to have it removed and tested so you know for sure.  If you're not comfortable with what the doc is telling you and they refuse to remove it and do a biopsy, I'd find another doctor.  Where I live, you don't have to have a referral to make an appt. with a surgeon, but it's probably different from state to state.
Please let us know what you find out.
Nancy
						

"
"


							I agree with Nancy. You need to have the lump biopsied. Like she said, you can't tell for certain from a mammogram or sonogram if it is benign or not. Eighty percent of breast lumps are NOT cancer, so that and you age are on your side. Please keep us posted. Hugs, Lauri

							Just to share my thoughts...My GYN said it was nothing and did a needle aspiration which came back negative.  I went to a surgeon who reviewed the ultrasound (didn't show on the mamo) and he was pretty sure it was nothing.  His feeling (must have been a gut feeling) was that it could obscure any future findings so he wanted to just take it out. Which I thank God for this very day.  I was dx is invasive duct carcinoma 1.6 cm, with no family history and very healthy, workout with cardio and weight lifting daily , I was 41.
While I agree that you are young and most likely its not bc..you just never know for certain unless you have it taken out or biopsied.

							Well here is my two cents worth ... First off where you are so young chances are that your breasts are so dense that the mammo may not be the best tool to use in diagnosing any problems.  Also, many times docs seem to minimize the problems that younger women may have related to breast conditions due to their age.  I am not telling you any of this to scare you but feel that women need to learn from an early age to be their own advocates when it comes to health care.  I unfortunately learned this in my early 20's, not from breast cancer but from other medical situations.  Though your doc may feel that it is a benign tumor, it is very important that you seek a follow up on this.  First off did he use the word tumor or did he use the word cyst?  These are two different things and cysts can be identified through ultrasounds.  secondly, if he/she did use the word tumor then my feeling is that unless that doc has magical fingers to go along with their magical thinking then they can not really tell if it is benign or not... thus you need to ask for a simple needle biopsy or some biopsy to be on the safe side.  I have a 28 year old daughter and would certainly enocurage her to followup any type of diagnosis of this type with a biopsy, better safe then sorry.  I am not  trying to scare you cause in reality most lumps or areas of suspicion that are biopsied are in reality benign.  However you must leave no stone unturned.  You also need to feel comfortable with your doctors diagnosis and should be able to communicate your fears with your doctor, who should always be part of your team.  As far as the hair goes, there are many reasons why people begin to experience hair losss, stress is one of the reasons that come to my mind immediately, where as I do not think that hair loss is an indicator of cancer... though that is the image that many have, but that is due to the chemotherapy drugs that we have to take, not to the cancer itself... so in my opinion get in touch with your doctor again and discuss how anxious you are about his/her diagnosis and seek a biopsy or find another doctor for a second opinion... best to you, let us know what happens!

I talked to my doc, however i see he's not going to help. He did say it was a ""Tumor"", and  again that it was nothing to worry about. However, I agree with what you guys say that without a biopsy there is nothing for sure, so im going to see a private doc about this; I'll let you know, the results

I WILL NEVER TAKE A CHANCE WITH SOMETHING LIKE THAT, IF ONE DOCTOR WILL NOT DO A BIOPSY WHEN SOMETHING SHOWS UP I WILL KEEP GOING TO DIFFERENT DOCTORS UNTIL I FIND ONE THAT WILL   BEST OF LUCK

							Hi - I had PUVA light therapy maybe 25 years ago - it has been around a long time - for extensive psoriasis. I only had one treatment as it caused a burning rash all over my body. However, my sister, who also has psoriasis, has had PUVA many times and it has helped bring the plaques under control. She is fairly dark skinned compared to me (we are both Caucasians). It does not hurt and only lasts a few minutes so she has nothing to fear. She will only know if she allergic to the treatment if she has it. I hope the treatment works for her.

I just wanted to let you know about photodynamic or blue light therapy. I hope that helps you in alternative solution for skin cancer treatment. It is helping dermatologists ward off skin cancer in patients with actinic keratoses.

Also known as solar keratoses, these scaly bumps range in size from pinhead to one inch and appear primarily in sun-exposed areas on the face, ears, head, lips and back of the hands and forearms. If left untreated, an estimated 10 percent of these precancerous lesions may eventually evolve into a type of skin cancer called squamous cell carcinoma.

Photodynamic, or blue-light, therapy for actinic keratosis can help treat and reduce the number of precancers, hopefully reduce the number of full-fledged skin cancers and possibly help in photo-rejuvenation.

You must try Trophy Skin's BlueMD. It is one of the best light therapy products for acne and other skin treatments. It provides a powerful, safe, effective and affordable blue light therapy which is approved by FDA and the American Academy of Dermatology.

I hope that solves your problem.

							I just received a diagnosis of melanoma on the posterior of left upper arm.  It is a Clark level 2 and Breslow is 0.28mm.  That is not too bad but the regression was stated as extensive, and from what I read that is a bad indicator for metastasis.  Surgery removed the melanoma and surrounding tissue, and the doctor said other than regular checkups there is nothing else normally done at this point.  We did do blood work and a chest xray yesterday and he manually checked the lymph nodes under the arm.  Is this the appropriate care at this point?  He said an SNB is not very valuable with a cancer like this and could cause undesired side effects.  I'm just looking to educate myself on prognosis and hopefully calm my fears.

							Hello

Since this is such an early tumor, a SNB was probably not necessary. Anyway, if the tumor is completely removed, you will probably only need regular checkups like they said.

							Hello all;

I've got this posted on another forum but I would like to get as much input as possible.

Cathy came through chemo with flying colours and will have a PICC line installed for the next one. Her veins are small and it will make everything go faster.

Before this adventure, we had been invited to visit her sister and her husband in Marsh Harbour, Bahamas, in February 2005. They are graciously paying for the trip with airmiles and we would be staying on their boat.

Are we nuts?

The chemo nurse said ""go for it!"" but I don;t think we explained it would be on a boat and not at a major resort.

At the time Cathy will be between chemo #4 and #5.

Any thoughts?

							Hi Pastor Rich,

The only thing I would be concerned about is flying, especially this year with many folks not being able to get their flu shots.  There are lots of germs passed at the airport (large crowds and germs also passed on the plane). For this reason, I did not fly until a couple months after chemo.  Maybe wearing a  mask would help with this?  

Anyway, it does sound like a blast!  I would have been very tempted!

Good luck,

							Hi Pastor Rich, 
I'm glad she did so well with her 1st chemo.  My concerns would be, alot of people and catching the flu or something as has been said.  The other is, some people feel the same through all their chemo treatments, some the 1st one is the worst and others, like me, each treatment got harder and harder.  With my 1st one, I felt real tired for a couple of days and then felt great, but each one had more bad days.  Fatigue is a given with chemo.  If there is anyway to make a final decision after she's had her 3 round, or even 2 round, I'll play it by ear and see hows she's feeing.  That's the ""gone through chemo"" version.. lol
IF the onco says go for it then go for it.  I'm just concerned about how she might feel the more chemo she gets.  Hopefully she'll be one of the lucky ones and it not be bad the entire time.

							I am scheduled to have surgery on Dec 9.  I am going to have a MRM on the right side and a simple mastectomy on the left.  I have chosen to go ahead with the simple mastectomy on the left.  There was a ""suspicious area"" and they were going to do a lumpectomy and then possibly have to come back and do more surgery if they found something...so I decided to go ahead and have the simple mastectomy done.  Now my questions have to do with reconstruction.  I have heard from a couple of people that had bad experiences but I want to hear the other side as well.  I am only 40 years old and I live in Florida so that means being in swimsuits a lot.  So I'm really considering this.  My husband says it makes no difference to him as long as I'm ok.  My surgeon recommended that I wait til after the initial surgery has healed and any radiation (if needed) has been done.  So give me all pros and cons so I can make an informed decision.

							Hi Shelly,
I would highly recommend against trying to have expanders and then implants because of radiation.  I tried it and after 3 months of extreme pain, they removed the expanders to find that they were trying to come back out of my skin around the sternum.  I had pain  on my sternum for about a year.  If you are going to do bilateral reconstruction, from everyone I've talked to, the LD Flap is the way to go.  They take tissue, muscle etc from under your shoulder blade and push it to the breast area and reconstruct the breasts.  It will mean having drains front and back, but they are more of a pain in the butt, then painful.  The only other option is Tram Flap, which is taking the muscle, blood supply etc. from your stomach and pushing all of that under your skin all the way up to your chest.  I've heard that it looks nice when it's done, but alot have had complications and extra surgeries and it is painful.  Nothing about this disease is easy is it.  I know here there is a place and I'm sure there where you can buy everything needed if you've ahd mastectomies.  From prothesis to bathing suits that have the prothesis and no one would ever know except you.  I'd get a consultation with a PS and they will show you before and after pics of each kind of reconstruction.  My PS will no longer do expanders on ladies that have had radiation.  I wish he figured that out before I tried it....lol

     I had a MRM 5.5 years ago for stage III A BC.  I was advised agains reconstruction at the time due to the fact that they knew that I would have to aggressive chemo and radiation (I had a lumpectomy first without clean margins)  So I waited until after I was done with radiation on the advice of the surgeon.  Well I decided last year to look into reconstruction and was going to have a tram done in June, I was sick on the day of the surgery thus it was cancelled.  I then decided I would have it done around thanksgiving but in the meantime have decided not to do it for now... so... I just want to let you know that with one breast (a huge one at that...LOL) I still get along quite well with just the prosthesis.   Now a bathing suit can be an issue for me as that I do have a large breast , however where you will be having bilateral mast. then you will be much better able to control the balance issue.  There are some amazing mastectomy suits out there, amazing prothesis out there and bras, so that should make this whole thing easier to deal with.  Also there are so many reconstruction options that you may find it worth it to wait and explore all those options before having to make a decision in such a short time...

I just had my first round of chemo on Monday. Still felt queasy off and on for Thanksgiving Day ... the first time I didn't overeat for the holiday! My treatment is chemo every other Monday with a Neulasta shot on Tuesday. The chemo plan is 4 AC followed by 4 Taxol followed by radiation and then hormone treatment. I don't think this plan has changed much as I've heard of others who were on same schedule.  I had stage 3 C invasive lobular in both breasts, but the treatment is the same whether it was found in one or both breasts at time of diagnosis.  Hope this was helpful,

I had Stage IIIA and had 6 round of Cytoxin, Epirubensin (sp) and 5FU.  I had the 3 chemos at the same time 3 weeks apart.  I know not long after I had finished treatment, they found that giving chemo, in whatever combo, every 2 weeks instead of 3 was more effective, so you are right on track.  So far so good and it will be 3 years on Valentine's Day that I was dx.  You'll be on the NEDland express soon and starting your new life. Keep in touch and let us know how you are doing.

							Dear Shelley,

I had a RB mastectomy on March 3, 2004, with tissue expander reconstruction done at the same time.  I wholeheartedly recommend it.  Everyone I know (DC area) has the recon done at the same time as the mastectomy.  I strongly urge you to go for a second opinion.

I had aggressive treatment.  The chemo was dose dense - 4 AC then 4 Taxol, every 2 weeks.  A month off, then 28 rounds of radiation.  11 weeks after my last radiation (last Monday!), I had the final silicone implant put in.  

Of course, everyone is different, but for me, the reconstruction was almost pain free, did not extend my recuperation time, and gave me no trouble at all.  My body is strong, and undamaged - with the tissue expander, no muscles are taken or moved, so the rest of your body remains intact.

After you wake up from the surgery, you have a fair sized fake boob.  I think that that really helps the mental part of this whole thing.  There is some discomfort, but I don't think that I would really call it pain.  They give you muscle relaxer meds to allow the skin and muscle to stretch, and pain meds.  I was off the pain meds in a few days, and had a sort of abraded feeling inside, but it was not bad at all.  Of course, I was also recovering from the mastectomy, so who knows what caused the pain really?  Anyway, with both the mastectomy and the reconstruction, I was out of the hospital in 2 days, shopping in 4, driving in 5, and feeling really quite well in a week, and back to normal in 2.  The tissue expander surgery apparently does not add much to the recovery from the mastectomy.  

I had ""fill-ups"" - they add more saline to the tissue expander with a syringe - 2 or 3 times every few weeks after surgery until it was big enough.  My surgeon was very careful, and never overfilled it, so I had virtually no pain - one dose of ibuprofin just afterwards and that was it.  Truly not a big deal.  Some women have pain on fill-ups, but it seems to be from over filling, from what I can understand from them.

After the expander is put in and the saline fillups are finished, the next step is to have the expander removed and to have a permanent implant put in.  ""Permanent"" is a bit of a misnomer, because the implants have to be replaced in 10 or 15 years, but OK.  At that point, you have a choice of a saline or a silicone implant.  You'll have to do your own research, but I decided to have silicone.  If you have radiation and chemo, the final implant has to wait until that is all over.  Usually, you have to wait at least 3 months after your last radiation treatment.  I did really well with radiation, and my skin seems the same as it was before - I think that I am lucky, but also, I used moisturizing cream 3x a day from day 1 of radiation, and that helped I am sure, so be vigilant with that cream.

There are two main problems that can cause problems that have to do with how your body reacts.  One is capsular contracture.  That is when the body reacts to a foreign thing being placed in it (the expander), and makes alot of scar tissue, which can squeeze the expander.   If this happens, they can ""release"" the contracture when they put in the final implant by doing some well placed cuts within.  The other is that radiation usually toughens the skin and muscle.  I suppose that that could squeeze the expander or make it harder to do the final implant, but I am unclear why it makes a difference having the radiation before or after the expander is put in.  

In any case, I don't think that I had either of the above problems.  I go to the reconstructive surgeon on Tuesday for my first post op visit and he will tell me what he found when he went in - whether he had to fix any capsular contracture and how the muscle did from the radiation.  

However, I am not even a week after the surgery, and the fake boob is soft and comfy, both in my chest and to the touch.  It feels soft, just like my real remaining boob.  And this last surgery was a real breeze, no kidding.  It took an hour, and I was out of the hospital about 2 hours after that.  Took 1 percocet every 3 hours the first afternoon/evening, and that was it.  I drove the next day. 

Now, I don't want to mislead you.  The tissue expander (remember, this is the temporary one!) is boob-like, but it will not look like your real one, although you can disguise it with bras that will even you up.  The expander (mine, at least) was high, wide and shallow.  I did best with a sports bra or a camisole with a shelf, that squished my other breast and brought it up (I'm 51, so I have a bit of a droop).  The expander is rigid, and has saline in it, and it is hard.  I called it ""the Brick"".  It has to be that way, because they are stretching the muscle and the skin.  They expand it to be bigger than what it will be with the final implant so there's enough room for the skin to reshape around the final implant.  Anyway, no one noticed the difference in the 2 breasts except for me, and I wear loose shirts or jackets  alot.

After the final implant, which has a boob-like shape, it takes a few months for the skin and muscle to reshape around it and start to project.  Because they can't make a fake boob droop like a 51 year old breast, I am having an uplift done on my other breast when the fake one has settled into its final shape (and they will try to match them).  At that time, they will take some regular skin from the old boob that they would otherwise discard, and use it to make a fake nipple.  That's not a big surgery either.  When that is healed, they will tattoo the fake nipple.  Of course, I am not done yet, but I can see that this is going to be one gorgeous breast!  I also have a beautiful, almost invisible scar, which I bet will fade even more over time.

So that's the whole process.  All in all, pretty much hassle free, pain free and easy.  I had always been a B, but had drooped my way into a C.  The new one and the uplifted one will be a full B or so, which is a good size for an implant, not too heavy.

If you are considering one of the flap reconstructions, please consider that they have to take muscle and move it, and then you don't have the muscle where it is supposed to be.  I cannot imagine doing that.  

Another thing to consider regarding timing - you know, you can get used to anything, even an unreconstructed breast.  And, after all you are going to be going through, are you going to want to start a whole new process when you are done?  And it just extends the process.  Here I am, 3 months after radiation, pretty much all done, with my final implant in.  

Also, my general breast surgeon (who did the mastectomy) and my reconstructive surgeon (expanders/implants) work together, and strategized when they are doing the operation as to how it is best to cut for the best reconstruction result.  I think that also added to the beautiful result and easy recovery.

Good luck with your decision.  Please feel free to write to me at wordweaverbethesda@yahoo.com; if you want to call and talk, let me know via email.

							Hi,

Well....I like to play on the computer, too!  I probably spend too much time there.  LOL  I also like to cook, especially baking goodies (share them with the neighbors).  Reading is fun.  We do lots of year-round walking, too.

I LOVE the outdoors.  You have to if you live in Maine!  In the summer I love hiking, boating and swimming.  The swimming part is easy bacause we have a body of water and a raft right out back.  We also have a canoe.  My sis and her hubby have a boat so we have to visit them in the summer to do any REAL boating.  LOL

In the winter we ice skate out back.  We also have a hill in the yard and like to go sledding on it.  

Edited to add:  How could I forget this one?  It's my favorite.  Hubby has a motorcycle and we spend lots of the spring, summer and early fall riding around on that.

This is probably more than you wanted to know!? LOL

I like to surf the net for ideas on things to do.  The net is like a huge library for me.  I love to learn and read.  The internet is great for finding projects to do around the house...whether it be decorating ideas, projects or crafts and craft projects.

I travel with my mother a lot, especially during the summer months. She is almost 79 and likes to travel the US by car, and I don't want her on the road alone. I am involved in local Relay for Life (American Cancer Society fundraiser) and some social/professional organizations.

							I would like to re-echo Laurie, in that I should have explored this area of the forum much sooner.   What a fun place!
My hobbies are like most of you the computer.    Although do not spend the time I used to prior to retiring last February (04).   

Guess my first love would be research.    Research of anything, but only one topic at a time.    Ranges from Angels to Zoology; and of course right now, Breast Cancer (but not the entire field of breast cancer, just the field of Radiology in association with BC).   From what I have read so far, I have renewed respect for the entire field.  I never realized how much more advanced they were then many of the other fields associated with BC.   As a profession, Radiologists must be rather humble, as I never heard too much about this field, or their advances in knowledge, until now.

My other hobbies are reading, and travelling.    I have so many other things I am interested in, and have done in the past; but never seem to have the time to re-invest my self in any of them.   Although, one day, I am sure I will.   

If I had one wish, I would wish for more hours in the day to really experience all there is to do in life.    Just taking care of basics, such as sleeping, eating, bathing, praying, walking, etc. seem to take almost all the time there is at any given moment.

There is a lump that you can feel with the softest touch of your finger.  The lump is sore, but does not hurt to where a bra.  I am worried, I am just 23 years old and have a 5 year old daughter.  Noone in my family has ever had breast cancer.  Please help me ease my mine.

							Hi Beth,

You really need to get this checked out by a doctor asap.  Most lumps (80 percent) are benign but there is no way of knowing what it is unless you get a mammogram and an ultrasound and a clinical breast exam.  Plus, you have your age working in your favor.  BUT young women can and do get breast cancer.  Not saying that is what you have (could be a cyst or a fibroadenoma) but you need to find out.  You also need peace of mind.  Most women who get breast cancer do not have a history of it in their family.  Any lump, thickening or other change in the breast HAS to be checked out.

Hugs to you.  I am keeping my fingers crossed you get good news.

							I have been going to the Gastro doctor for the past six months complaining of adominal pain.  I have been dianosed with GERD for many years, but this pain is different.  I had my gallbadder remove in 2/04.  I had a CT scan Nov 15, 04.  The results are as follows: 
""Abdomen: A tiny, approx. 3mm nodule is identified in the right lung base.  A small, approx. 5mm pleural based nodule is present in the lingula.  the lung bases are otherwise clear.  A punctate calcification is present in the left lobe of the liver consistent with prior granulomatous disease.  A tiny, approx. 5mm, low attentuation lesion is present in the right lobe of the liver.  The liver and spleen are otherwise unremarkable.  The patient is status post cholecystectomy.  The adrenals, kidneys, and pancreas appear normal.  The visualized portions of bowel appear normal.  The aorta is calcified consistent with atherosclerotic disease.
Pelvis:  The distal ureters and urinary bladder appear normal.  The patient appears to be in status post hysterectomy.  The visualized portions of the bowel appear normal.  The aorta is calcified, consistent with atherosclerotic disease.""
IMPRESSION: 1. ""Tiny, approx. 3mm, nonspecific nodule in right lung Base on Image 5 and small Pleural based nodule in the Lingula.  The differential Diagnosis would include GRANULOMA, LYMPH NODE, HAMARTOMA, FIBROSIS, or LESS LIKELY, NEOPLASTIC PROCESS.  Concider a three month followup for further evaluation if clinically indicated"" 2. ""STATUS POST CHOLECYSTECTOMY."" 3. ""ATHEROSCLEROTIC DISEASE"".

My doctor is not telling me must except wait three months and see what happens.  He thinks the nodule in lung is probably benign.  I am 53 years old, non smoker, thought I was somewhat healthy.  Now I am worried to wit's end.  What should I be doing?

This is very common, to find lung nodules that are not malignant-looking. We do what you were told. Follow up with another scan in a few months, and only if it changes something else could be done.

							Nancy and everyone else on this forum... especially Leo, our hardworking founder... I too want to wish everyone a very happy thanksgiving.  Thanksgiving took on a whole new meaning to me 6 years ago.. I was diagnosed just before thanksgiving.  Through the years I have had so much to be Thankful for but in the last 6 years I have had the privledge of meeting and sharing with so many women and men of courage and strength who have inspired me and given me hope.  Though some are no longer with us, many are, and all their inspiration and support will be with me always, and for this I am so thankful. For those just starting this journey know that you too will look back on this time and be thankful not that you have had to fight this awful disease but for all the wonderful people that this experience will bring into your life.  I hope that this experience will bring out the best in those you love and those who love you and you will feel all of this on your journey.  Thank you all for helping me along my journey as well!  Have a safe and wonderful holiday!

Low back is such a common problem. You said that you have no reasons to have pancreatic cancer, but for some reason you are worried about it. If you are concerned enough you should go to a doctor. But pancreatic cancer can cause many symptoms, usually weight loss, jaundice etc.

							I have a lump that is probably close to 3 cm across at 9o'clock on my right breast.  I have had a mamogram that was negative and a negative ultrasound.  My primary care physician called this fibrosystic tissue (having only palpated the lump) and the radiologist called it ""a ridge of dense breast tissue--nothing of concern"".  I have had a persistant discharge (greenish brown) for over four months as well (expressed, not spontanious).  I am 34 years old and have a lot of extended family breast cancer, but none in my immediate family.  I am not totally convinced by the explanations I received.  Should I insisted on a biopsy?  Do I get a second opinion?
						

"
"


							Hi,
YES, find a doctor that will do a biopsy.  The only good lump is one in a jar.  I too had a negative mammogram and ultra sound but my gut said there was something wrong.  I insisted on a biopsy and I was dx with Stage III Invasive Lobular BC.  The actual lump, isn't necessarily the total size, IF it is breast cancer.  My actual lump was 3.5 cm, but what I had a mastectomy done, they found 2 more cm of cancer in the surrounding tissue.  I also had 9 positive lumph nodes out of 16.  I have no family history of breast cancer or cancer in general.  The only way to be sure if it is cancerous of B9 is with a biopsy. My suggestion is an incisional biopsy beacuse even a needle biopsy can show a false negative.
Again, it may not be breast cancer, BUT you won't know until a biopsy is done and if you're like I was, when my gut wasn't comfortable with what I was being told, you won't relax until you have it done.
Please keep us posted

							Hello

It would help also to know your age. If you are young and having this discharge, it might be a case of mastitis. But I would advise you to see another physician and see what he/she has to say. You don't necessarily need to repeat the tests, just bring the films to whoever you see.

AFTER ABOUT 2-3 DAYS OF THIS HE STARTS TO RETURN TO NORMAL. WE ARE WONDERING IF THIS IS A SIDE EFFECT OF THE CHEMOTHERAPY AND/OR IS THERE A WAY TO MINIMIZE THESE EFFECTS. HE IS VERY WEAK AFTER CHEMO-HAS TO USE A WALKER BUT GETS STRONGER DAY BY DAY AFTER CHEMO. UNFORTUNATELY JUST WHEN HE SEEEMS TO GET STRONGER IT IS TIME FOR CHEMO AGAIN., HE IS SCHEDULED FOR AT LEAST 2 MORE TREATMENTS-TREATMENTS ARE THREE DAYS LONG OF STRONG CHEMO--ANY INFO OUT THERE??

							Ronald,

What your father probably had is called delirium. It is a reversible condition that frequently affects older and/or debilitated people. We see this all the time after almost any treatment. Just the fact of being in a different environment can cause this. But like you saw, it improved with time and trying to orient the person. Treatment for condition is essentially supportive. He is certainly at risk for having it again, so it's a good idea to let the doctors and nurses know that he has had delirium before.

							Leo, 
Is bone marrow cancer the same as leukemia?
Heather

							Hello

Primary cancer of the bone marrow may be called a number of things. There is not just one cancer of the bone marrow. A few names: leukemia, polycythemia vera, myelofibrosis, essential thrombocythemia etc. The bone marrow may also be the site of metastasis from cancers arising elsewhere.

							I was thinking about mammograms and you know how they really press down hard on the breast making them as flat as possible? It is painful and it is a lot of pressure. And sometimes they have to do it mulitple times.
Well, I was thinking, if you had a DCIS that was still safely  IN SITU could a mammogram's pressure push it so it breaks through the duct?
My path was a DCIS AND IDC. So I always assumed that had I caught it early I would have a better prognosis. But if a woman has just a plain contained DCIS that is forced out of its containment just from the mammo could that be why some women do much better than others? Meaning that they didn't have as aggressive a cancer as assumed- it was just made to look that way.
What do you think Dr. Leo?
						

"
"


							Hi Martha Anne, I'm sure Dr. Leo will respond to your questions, but I've never heard of a mammogram procedure causing cells to rupture. I know that they squish you really hard and flat, but I would really be surprised if something happened that was not supposed to. If you are really concerned, talk to your doctor about an ultrasound. Neither proceedure is foolproof, but are better than not having any diagnosistic tests done. Just my 2 cents. Lauri
						

"
"


							It is nice to know I am not the only one to suppose this is possible.

Mammograms have been around a lot longer than much knowledge about DCIS, what it is, what it does, and what it doesn't. And mammograms are so well established that it is pretty hard to get anyone to consider change even if it IS in everybody's best interest. 

(Consider how long it took science to get a better idea about the danger of estrogen replacement therapy.)

I don't think anyone has ever collected the statistics to find out whether mammos cause DCIS to be squished out of the ducts or lobules, and if it does, whether it then sends out signals to stimulate angiogenesis and the subsequent development of IDC or lobular cancer. (Not to mention the cumulative effects of annual rads from the mammograms.)

Studies are already demonstrating that MRI and not mammograms should be used for women at high risk with dense breasts. MRI's are more expensive in the short run, but early detection for such woman with MRI is cheaper in the long run (not to mention more humane).

							Hello

There are theoretical risks of causing the malignant cells to migrate when you push the tissue surrounding it. But it is a matter of risk/benefit ratio, meaning that there is so much information that can be gained from a mammogram, and there is little if any evidence out there about the risk of cells migrating when you squeeze the breasts. Sure, MRI is an alternative, but if we just stop doing mammograms and start doing MRIs on everyone we will have to sell our houses to pay the insurance bills. 

regards,
Leo
						

"
"


							As noted, the studies that support the use of MRI are in regard to those women at high risk, with dense breasts. This is not the entire population of women receiving mammograms, just those most likely to present the highest risk. Early detection is of significant economic value; the larger a cancer is, the greater the $ expense of treatment. 

Again, current science seems uncertain whether or how DCIS progresses to IDC or lobular carcinoma. Unless someone does a study of breast tissue to find out if squishing it and radiating causes DCIS to break through the duct walls or lobule walls and then lead to IDC or lobular cancer I wouldn't be the one to pooh-pooh the notion out of hand. If we aren't willing to consider the possibilities we are more likely to see the 1 in 8 women who get breast cancer become 1 in 7 and then 1 in 6....

And that truly would raise the cost of our insurance.

							The last report I saw said that it is down to 1 out of every 7 women will get BC in their life time.  When I was dx in 2/02, it was one out of 9, so every year it is becoming more and more likely that more and more women will get this disease.  I wonder how much lower it will go, I mean the odds against women.

							Hi,

But then we're still left with the problem of the biopsies.  Who knows if when they stick the needle in it stirs everything up to the extent of spreading cancer cells?  Or maybe the surgeon just isn't careful enough about the procedure?

Margie
						

"
"


							Leo may need to correct me on this 1st part, but I'm almost positive I'm right on it.  A needle biopsy can still miss cancer cells unless several area of the tumor/mass are taken and get right where there are cancer cells.  
I asked my surgeon and my onco about always hearing that once they open you up, like for an incisional biopsy, that when air hit it, it spread.  They both told me that ""urban legand), for lack of a better word has been told for years and years and there in absolutely no truth to it.
Take care
Nancy
						

"
"


							Yes, I had the fine needle biopsy and it came back negative for cancer.  But my surgeon INSISTED that we go in anyway and do the excisional.  And to think I almost cancelled the excisional.  I almost cancelled it because back then I knew absolutely NOTHING about BC and I thought if the fine needle says negative, then I must be fine and why not live with a benign tumor?  That was back in my days of total ignorance.  Scary.

Margie

							Unfortunately breast cancer is a complicated disease, and the vast majority of those of us with bc do not know enough about it at the time of diagnosis. I didn't.

Medical specialization is contributing to the problem. Most practitioners we see have little ability to coordinate overall treatment for a disease that directly affects primarily females. How many oncologists or radiologists have had breast cancer? They expect the GP, the internist, or the OB-GYN to handle the problems with the rest of the body that result from chemo or rads. But the GP, the internist, and the OB-GYN who acknowledge that these things affect the endocrine system stand back and do nothing about the endocrine problems that are a direct result of chemotherapy or rads.  

IF estrogen and and and an increasingly estrogenic environment coupled with heredity are major reasons for the development of breast cancer, then isn't it an endocrine disease? We usually see a GP, internist, or OB-GYN for monitoring the breast, who refers us to the radiologist (who often never sees us in person) and we are then referred to a surgeon. If the surgeon finds breast cancer we have surgery and are referred to the oncologist, who doesn't deal with endocrine problems, psychological issues such as sexuality and reproduction, or much of anything other than chemotherapy and radiation and sometimes death. Very rarely do any of us see an endocrinologist, and by the time we do it is only after more damage has been done to the endocrine system and the immune system. How often are we referred to an immunologist to help us figure out what we have left to work with after chemotherapy and rads?

The chain of command used to deal with breast cancer just might not make a lot of sense.

							My father, 75 yo w 60 pack year smoker, quit 3 years ago, COPD, recently had a colonoscopy.  18 benign polyps were removed but it was determined one was to big to be removed without surgery.  The gastroenterologist was not concerned and the surgery was scheduled for approximately one month later.  Prior to surgery he had a chest CT scan that revealed a 2 cm nodule in his lower lobe of his left lung.  This nodule was not present 10 months earlier in a lung cancer screening CT scan.  A PET scan revealed a positive high metabolic rate in that nodule, revealed another pea sized ""glowing"" nodule in his middle lobe of his left lung and ""glowed"" in the colon polyp.  According to his second hand account to me there were no lymph nodes.  His physician did not speculate whether the lung lesions were primary or metastatic from the colon.   He has an appointment with a thorasic surgeon next week.  He has a friend, a retired nephrologist, who recommended he avoid surgery at all costs, predicting a less than 3 month prognosis following any surgery, and opt for very conservative treatment.   Do you have any thoughts as to:  1)  how often colon carcinoma metasticizes to the lungs, 2)  which should be treated first, 3)  overall prognosis and 4)  surgery/treatment recommendations.

Thank you.

							Hello

Thanks for posting. You certainly have a lot of questions. 

There is no established diagnosis yet, so you can not say for sure that it is cancer. For that it is necessary that he gets a biopsy. For the lung, he might get an open biopsy (wedge biopsy), which may determine then what type of lesion it is. Pathologists often are able to establish if a tumor is primary from the lung, but not always. The other option is to biopsy the colon polyp, and that may determine if that lesion is malignant or not. This is a very complex situation, and you should talk to a good pulmonary doc, a thoracic surgeon and a GI doc about all this. But try not to jump to early conclusions, the best thing is to gather all the information first.

best regards,

							This is my first time to post on this site after it being suggested by a friend and there seems to be a great deal of support and help here.  One month ago was diagnosed with breast cancer -- lumpectomy of 1.6 cm and anxillary node dissection with one lymph node involved.  Just had first round of chemotherapy which fortunately went pretty well with minimal nausea (exercise seemed to help the most).  The bruising around the incision has been extensive and appears blood is now accumulating at the incision.  Last week the surgeon aspirated which resulted in reduction of bruising but the incision area seems to be swelling, quite painful and soft.  Went back to surgeon and did another aspiration and removed quite a lot of blood.  He believes surgery at that site to remove blood might be necessary if this doesn't relieve the problem.  From what I've read this is not uncommon and the body usually heals itself although it may take quite a long time.  My question, has anyone else had this and is there anything I can be doing to help the process along.  I do not want to go back into surgery (2x in one month is enough) and it will delay the chemo therapy schedule, which I don't want to do.  Any thoughts or suggestions?

							Hi Marion,

I did have a hematoma after my lumpectomy.  It looked horrible but all the doctors decided it should just be left alone to heal.  No draining, nothing.  It took  months before it went away entirely.  It did delay the chemo, but only by a couple of weeks.  They gave it some healing time, then decided it was ok to proceed with the chemo.   Eventually, everything turned out ok.  I'm sure each case is a little different and we are all affected differenly by these things.

Good luck.

You are so right about the tears, but it feels good to let them flow and relieve some of the anxiety.  If you onco doesn't offer, don't hesitate to ask for something.  I went in before my 4th treatment and had been crying for a week.  He gave me a RX for Paxil and within about a week, I could feel a big difference.  You'll get to the point that you get mad at this disease and you'll be ready to kick some cancer butt.  Don't ever feel guilty about having a ""pitty party"" because we all do.  I remember a friend telling me she was taking a hot bath and wanted to be alone to have a pitty party, her husband came in and asked if she was o.k. and she threw a bar of soap at him... lol  You'll go through so many emotions and we're here for you and there is nothing you can say that would shock any of us who have been where you are right now.

							I developed a hematoma after surgery which was huge and painful. The surgeon decided to put on a pressure bandage and not drain it. It has been a month after my partial mastectomy and the blood (and scar tissue?) has become rock hard and still painful. The oncologist said I would need to heal for about 4 more weeks before starting radiation.

My fear is that the radiation will make it harder and more permanent.

							Hi there All - I had a double mastectomy & immediate reconstruction in May 09 and had suffered with seroma's in back where the latissimus dorsi muscles were removed - after several very traumatic aspirations of the two sites, my surgeon eventually tried a steroid injection into each site and I must say that this has worked a treat !!!!

On my front though, above my left 'breast' I've had a hematoma which keeps recurring and is unsightly and painful, preventing me from moving on now...   This week he drained it once again and injected steroid into it, unfortunately within 2 days I can see that this is not working as well as on the back.  

On a positive front though - I was so unsure about having the complete double/double operation and as these are so seldom done, I was not able to contact anyone who had had this procedure..... BUT ..... I can assure anyone who is about to go through it, or thinking of the options.... Go For It !!!   I found it to be absolutely wonderful, if that's at all possible... ???

My dad had to have his gall bladder removed due to gall stones. The surgery was cancelled by the anesthesia doctor because no stress test was given for his heart, well they found that he had 80 to 90% blockage in the main artery but could not due surgery because of the fluid that had suddenly built up in his belly, so they drained it and had to find out what caused it so they eventually did a biopsy on his liver.

They diagnosed him with liver cancer and after doing a ct scan, said there was nothing that could be done for this type of cancer, said he had a 7 cm tumor on the inside of his liver, that it had not spread it was only in the liver and gave him six months to live and told him chemo could maybe prolong his life a few months, but that would be it.

He has decided not to take chemo for his grand kids sake, what is another 2 months. I have been looking up a lot of things on the internet and have maybe gotten my hopes up for not. I do not want to go with my dad about the info for incase I just read what I wanted it to say.

After reading all i read, it is just hard for me to accept that there is nothing they can do and that i only have another 4 or 5 months with him.

Unfortunately liver cancer does not have a good prognosis. But there are options available, not only in the form of chemotherapy. One technique is called radiofrequency ablation, which may help when used in the right patient. Chemotherapy may help, but like you said the benefit is not huge.

He said that all of my axillary lymph nodes felt hard, like small jelly beans, where most are usually somewhat squishy.

Chemo might not reach your brain, but it can sure make you feel DUH at times when it comes to remember.

							Hi Pastor Rich,
I noticed FEC.  Is that the chemo regime she's on?  The only combo of chemo that I've heard that you don't lose all your hair necessarlily, but definately thin out is CMF.  I doubt she's getting that being stage III.  If she's getting FEC, that's the 3 I was on and I had hopes I wouldn't lose mine because it took awhile.  Normally, ladies lose it on the 14th day after the 1st round of chemo.  My hair was real thick and that may be why I didn't lose mine until after the 3rd round of FEC, or it may have been a fluke, but I ended up losing all of it even though it started later.  If it's FEC, or AC w/Taxol or Taxotere, she's going to lose it unfortunately.  What I did, and I'm not sure how long your wife's hair is, is I cut mine 3 different times to make it not such a huge shock until it was right under my ears.  He was well below my shoulder and is AGAIN .  If her hair is long, why not cut some of the length, so she can still wear the wig.  That way she gets use to it and when it does start coming out, she'll be use to seeing herself in the wig.  Some ladies I've heard comes out in clumps.  With mine, I went to brush it one morning and with ever stroke, the brush was full of hair.  I handled both my mastectomies better then losing my hair, so don't be surprised if she takes it hard, I guess it's the outer part of who we are, where at least with a mastecomy(ies), there are clothes cover us.
Best wishes to your wife and please keep us posted on how she's doing and how YOU are doing.

							Hello Pastor Rich,

Yes, she will lose most of her hair. She may be left with fuzzies and not be completely bald but she will want to wear a hat or scarf or wig.

I think you got very good advice! It is not necessary to shave it clean right now. It can be cut short in several layers. That way as it comes out the layers will slowly diminish. 

Most women start to feel a tingling sensation around day 14 and she will see more in the shower and more in her brush - but builds gradually. What usually happens is it feels so yucky you just want to shave it and get it over with!

This IS a big thing. Our hair is our ""thing"". And it is like losing a friend. But the best part is that this friend comes back!!!

And, if I may, FEC has been getting WONDERFUL results! So I pray your wife and YOU are also blessed with the healing powers of this medicinethatmakesussickbeforewegetbetter Medicine.

							I like hearing that about FEC and wonderful results.  I will be 3 years since my dx on Valentine's Day and I got FEC and so far so good, and I'm praying it will keep going that way.  I use to think 43 was getting old, but now I know I'm just a baby still, even though I just turned 46 last month.  After this crappy disease, you definately love seeing those b'days come!!!

Pastor Rich,
I couldn't wear a wig, it just felt funny to me, but alot of women have no problems.  If your wife isn't comfortable in them, you can go to Hobby Lobby if you have one and they have every color and pattern of bandanas down there from denim to dressy.  I wore those all the time and then when I started getting a little bit of hair, I'd buy the women's ball caps from walmart.
It's funny now.  My hair is to the length it was before I lost it and what do I do, wear a ballcap and pull the back through the opening to keep it off my back and shoulders.....LOL
I'll talk to ya'll when I get back on my feet, or wrist.. lol

							Hello all;

This is a great place we wish we never had to know about, isn't it?

So far Cathy has had about 2 hours of nausea and that is it. That was the night of the 1st chemo.... we prayed and asked the folks on the catholic forum to pray (www.catholic.org) and the nausea was gone. She has had some hot flashes but after seeing our doctor those are almost gone as well. (Cathy is 54 next month). Next chemo is Dec 10th.

And, if I haven't shared this, the radiologist told us that after she finished the chemo and radiation, there is less than a 10% chance of recurrance. Of course, that's not a guarantee but it was welcome news. The way they put it is that what they are doing is not curative but is preventative.

Today our grandson will be born, probably by c-section, and Cathy will head down on Friday to help. So tomorrow she will get her head trimmed as she doesn't want to have it fall out away from home.

And, she does have her wig. Our finances are tight as she is the major income-earner and being a contract worker she has no disability income. Several of the ""church-ladies"" offered to pay anonymously for her wig. Well, it turned out that Cathy needs a blend, not synthetic because she is allergic to acrylic. (The wig shop let her try one of each). The price was $650 Canadian, or about $500US. We had thought it would be about $200. The ladies didn't even bat an eye -- they said ""let us bless you as God has blessed us.""

And Cathy has her wig.

Blessings to you all as well,

							Dear Pastor Rich,
Congratulations on the birth of your new grandbaby!

Do you heve regular medical insurance? Because if you do a wig is covered under that. All you need is a prescription from your doctor for a head prothesthis (sp?) and they cover about 90% of the cost.

You have to use a wig salon that participates, but MOST do!

Enjoy the little one!

							Pastor Rich and Cathy,  Big congrats on the new grandbaby!  These huge miracles become even more awesome when paired with the journey that we undertake with this darn disease.  When I was diagnosed I had hair that was below my waist.  Each doctor that I saw would say I suggest that you get your hair cut before you start chemo.  Well I got it cut 4 times before it fell out.. I did not have the nerve to get it cut short right off the bat   Well it all fell out by the 21st day, by then it was short layers however it was very aggrevating as that it sheds and was getting all over the place.  I never was on a board nor did I know anyone who had gone through any of this at the time, it was not until it had all either fallen out or I pulled it out, which I did spend one morning doing and putting it in a baggie (dont ask me what I was doing that for, cause I dont know....LOL)  Well I finally did have a friend shave my head.  You know when it is falling out because it starts to ache like when your hair is pulled back for a long time in a pony tail and you take it out.  That was when it just came out with a little tug.  The day that it started to ache I woke up and realized that it was comming out.. was driving my son (15 at the time) to school and told him that his music was driving me so crazy I could just pull my hair out, and tugged out a clump of it.. he was shocked, we laughed but he did ask me not to do that when his friend, who we drove to school, got in the car... It was going to happen anyways so I decided to make the best of a bad situation, had alot of laughs that day about it, even set up a friend when she called and asked what I was doing. I told her that I was pulling my hair out, she thought I was bored and asked me to go out with her, when she came and picked me up she realized that I was literally pulling my hair out... that was a good one.  I hated my wigs, which the insurance company did not pay for, so only wore them a couple of times.  You are blessed to have such wonderful women in your lives to help you with this... I am sure that you know that the people that are put into your lives and the prayers that are offered up by the many are so important. I hope that Cathy's treatment continue to go smoothly and that you will be able to take that trip that you have been offered.  My thoughts and prayers are with you both and with your new grandbaby and his/her new mom and dad!
HUGS!

							Dear Pastor Rich:  How life affirming to celebrate the birth of your first grandchild.  I am about in the same cycle as Cathy.  I will have my second chemo today, AC.  My head is a bit tingly and if I tug on my hair it will come out.  I had it cut very short in anticipation of losing it all.  It still represents one more loss and saddens me.  I can't hide my diagnosis any more.  Some people don't seem to get the emotional magnititue of hair loss.  It is like you knew it was going to happen so why is it bothering you...duh.   It is bothering me and I don't like it.  Will I tolerate it? Of, course.  Glad that Cathy had very little nausea and your wonderful church women are coming through with a wig which she can tolerate.  It is so wonderful to know we are not alone on this cancer path.  In love and spirit, Sharon

Thank you for the information regarding my Aunt's metastatic lung cancer.  Today we found out that she is back in the hospital with weakness on her whole left side of her body as well as with low potassium levels.  She has had trouble with seizures and her last one was on Thanksgiving and has not gained the strenght back in her left side. Is it a possibility that even with radiation treatments to her brain that the tumors are continuing to grow and have not been stopped?  I don't think that she is telling us the full story as she doesn't want us to worry.  What are we looking towards in the future as far as her overrall health and problems that may occur.  Thanks again.

It is very possible that the brain lesions are progressing. Radiation may not stop them from growing, it is only a temporizing measure. It is hard to predict what might happen, but she may get all sorts of complications, especially now that she is physically impaired.

We went through   brain surgery and then was told he would die in 4 months without treatment and in 1 year if we had treatment.
We went to Tulsa, OK to CTCA and now the cancer is almost gone or in remission.  Please Please go to there web sight. www.ctca.com and they will answer your questions and give  you much hope.

How was everyone's Thanksgiving weekend?  We (hubby and teenage son) headed down to Connecticut to spend the holiday with my sis and brother-in-law.  She made a wonderful dinner.  Then on Friday we drove to New Haven and took the train to NYC.  Spent the day shopping and walking around with the terrific crowds.  Nothing like the NYC crowds!  We had lunch at our fav german restaurant.  Then sis and brother-in-law bought me a beautiful pair of rose quartz earrings at Tiffany's.  I am truly blessed to have such a wonderful family.

							New to this site but would like to post a question/situation....

My husband was diagnosed with stage 4 colon cancer 2 years ago.  They were able to remove all the detectable disease but chemo was delayed due to 2 strokes, one occuring during the initial surgery and another while treatment with heparin.   He also had massive diarrhea from a new colon(!) and overuse of antibiotics.  

In April, his CEA was 629 and they switched him to his third chemo regime which did bring it down to 10 something in Sept but now it is, again, back up to 63.4.  He is growing tired of the weekly chemo, the diarrhea that occurs due to the chemo and the fatigue.  There is only one option left and that is still kind of experimential.

My question now..
Initially, I promised him that I would not allow him to suffer.   If it appeared that the end was actually near, I would help him--ie, I would not allow him to just linger.   I'm not sure if he remembers me making this statement but I remember.   Now I'm not really sure I could do it.  I have the means and, really, no one would be the wiser, but I'm not sure I could do it.  I am a registered nurse and have worked in the hospice field for 2 years and have dealt with end of life patients for most of my career.   I know the suffering that can occur at the end.   I'm just not sure I could actually do what would be necessary to bring about the end and not suffer terrible guilt myself.   Granted, it wouldn't be now....he still can walk, talk, eat....little pain but this is related to arthritis.   
Could you do it???

							HI,

I FIRST OF ALL WANT TO WISH THE BEST FOR YOU AND YOUR HUSBAND. I UNDERSTAND WHAT YOU ARE TALKING ABOUT IN THAT MY HUSBAND AND I HAVE AGREED THAT NEITHER OF US WITH LET THEN EVER KEEP ONE OF US ALIVE ON MACHINES.  I HAVE BREAST CANCER AND MY MOTHER DIED OF BREAST CANCER IN 1978. AT THE TIME WHEN THINGS STARTED GETTING VERY BAD FOR HER A PA IN OUR FAMILY CAME TO VISIT MY MOTHER. BEFORE SHE LEFT SHE GAME ME A NEEDLE AND SOME MEDICINE AND TOLD HIM HOW TO DO IT. SHE TOLD ME NOT TO LET MY MOTHER LAY IN PAIN BUT SO LONG. MY MOTHER HAD ASK HER TO DO THIS AND LET HER KNOW THAT SHE WOULD TELL ME IF AND WHEN THE PAIN BECAME TO MUCH FOR HER. ONCE OUR FAMILY MEMEBER LEFT THAT DAY MY MOTHER ASK ME IF SHE HAD GIVEN MY ANYTHING. AS IT TURNED OUT I NEVER HAD TO DO ANYTHING. MY MOTHERS DOCTOR DID NOT LET HER BE PUT ON MACHINES OR DID HE LET HER FEEL ANY PAIN IN THE END. HE MADE SURE OF IT. WOULD I HAVE DONE IF IT HAD COME DOWN TO IT. I THINK I WOULD HAVE AND COULD HAVE BECAUSE I KNEW THAT IS WHAT SHE WANTED. I KNEW FULL WELL THAT I COULD HAVE GONE TO JAIL IF ANYONE FOUND OUT, YET I WAS ASURED NO ONE WOULD BE ABLE TO TELL BY WHAT I HAD BEEN GIVEN. I AM THANKFUL THAT I WAS NOT PUT TO THAT TEST IN THE LONG RUN. I DO NO THAT WHEN MY HUSBAND HAD BY PASS SURGERY AND WHEN I WENT IN TO SEE HIM THEY HAD A BREATHING MACHINE ON HIM. HE LOOKED AT ME, HE WAS FULLY AWAKE AND I KNEW WHAT HE WANTED. I SAID TO HIM DO YOU  WANT IT OUT AND HE SAID YES. THEY NURSE SAID HE WOULD NOT LIVE WITHOUT IT THAT HIS BREATHING WAS NOT GOOD ENOUGH. I LOOKED AND HIM AND THE NURSE AND TOLD HER THEY HAD 30 MINUTES TO GET HIM BREATHING ON HIS OWN AND IF HE WAS NOT IT CAME OUT. HE TOOK MY HAND AND LET ME KNOW I HAD SAID THE CORRECT THING. THE BREATHING MACHINE CAME OFF IN 1999 AND HE IS SITTING HERE WATCHIG TV RIGHT NOW BREATHING JUST FINE. I KNEW I COULD HAVE LOST HIM THAT DAY, BUT I WAS DOING WHAT HE WANTED NO MATTER WHAT ANYONE ELSE THOUGHT, THAT WAS WHAT WE HAVE  PROMISED EACH OTHER. WE BOTH STILL FEEL THE SAME WAY ABOUT THOSE MACHINES KEEPING A PERSON ALIVE. THIS MAY NOT HELP YOU BUT YOU ASK IF I COULD DO IT AND THIS IS THAT BEST ANSWER I HAVE.

							Hello

I have moved this topic to the colon cancer area, but it really is a very difficult situation. As you know, euthanasia is not lawful in the US. But physician-assisted suicide is legal in Oregon, so you can go there and have it there if you wish. Being such a controversial topic, I do not encourage people to inject anyone with anything. Imagine if it goes wrong and the person ends suffering even more. But this is a very personal opinion, and as a physician I always do my best to make patients as comfortable as possible.

best regards,

							This is a question that I think everyone with cancer has thought about.

First I would like to ask you if you and your husband have discussed this again? If he is relatively ok now, as you wrote, then now is the perfect time. This way YOU are clear on what HE wants. And you will know that when the time comes this decision was not made in the heat of extreme pain or anguish. It is a difficult question for regular people - but once you enter the world of cancer you can ask anything.

Now please do not think I am belittling this serious topic at all by what I am about to write. But I had a dog for close to 18 years. He was like a child to me. He had arthritis very bad, began to go blind, and had developed cancer. I wanted to do whatever I could to keep him alive. The vetrinarian said to me, there is no quality of life left for him. He is trying his best to stay alive for you and you are trying to keep him alive because you can't bear to lose him. But a life in agony is not a life and you have the power to end his suffering in a gentle, loving manner before the pain gets worse and it is the most giving thing you can do. So the vet came to the house and we said goodbye with my precious lying in my arms. 

I am bringing this point up because - why is it ok for a human being to live in agony tied to machines but considered heartless and cruel to let your family pet suffer by keeping him alive? A Vet will encourage you to take the pain away. Yet we don't know what our dog or cat or horse wants. 

As human beings we have the blessing of being able to make the decision for ourself. We can say to our husband, dear if it ever gets THAT BAD please don't let me suffer.

To me- THAT IS HUMANE. It is loving and it is the gift of trust. 

And if you have discussed it and are certain of his desires then you know what you have to do.

May God bless you both.

							It's a zombie thread! I've seen some old ones, but ten years takes the cake. 
It might be because of my religious convictions, but even knowing what the last few weeks will be like, while I would want the docs to help me be as comfortable as possible, I would not want affirmative action taken to end my life. That is up to God and nature, not me.

							Just wanted to recommend a book given to me by a dear friend who didn't know what to do for me or give me when I was first diagnosed.  You've heard of all the help books such as Computers for Dummies?  This book is ""Breast Cancer for Dummies""  I got it along with a note that said, ""I realize your anything but a dummy but this will help answer any questions you have, or help you to know what questions to ask the doctor"".  The doctor always asks ""do you have any questions"".  Well if I knew what questions to ask I would ask them!  I don't know what I would have done without this.  It takes you from diagnosis, to pathology reports, to emotional help.  A great book for anyone to understand what we are all going throough.
						

"

							Also wanted to add that the book ""Breast Cancer for Dummies"" also includes information on all available treatments options, side effects, a good section on lymphodema, what to expect after treatments, questions to ask your cancer center to be sure they are certified (certified cancer centers have a higher rate of recovery than non-certified), what your oncologist should provide you at consultation, etc.  You can get it at most major book stores.

Well hopefully you are not all like me I know that there are alot of us out here, LOL.. anyways, an excellent book that I read that helps put that ""waiting for the other shoe to drop "" feeling a little more at ease is a book called ""Dancing in Limbo: making sense of life after cancer""  I do not recall the authors names and have given out my last copy.  But it is a great book and I have used it for gifts for some of my friends who have gone through this too.  I have also used that Dr. Love book as gifts for others and suggested it to many... my breast bible when I was first diagnosed.  Another good book is Living beyond breast cancer.. by Dr. Weiss.  She also has a web site which you can get on her mailing list and get great information.  She is outside of the philadelphia area and I had a friend who was her patient.  She a a great advocate for breast cancer.  I think that I will pick up that breast cancer for dummies book on your recommendation... thanks!

"
"


							Hi Jane,

Here is some information on the birads:


 The American College of Radiology (ACR) has established the Breast Imaging Reporting and Database System (BI-RADS?) to guide the breast cancer diagnostic routine. Radiologists sometimes refer to each BI-RADS? category as a ""level."" 

BI-RADS? Assessment Categories

Category 0 Need Additional Imaging Evaluation 
Category 1 Negative 
Category 2 Benign Finding 
Category 3 Probably Benign Finding ? Short Interval Follow-Up Suggested 
Category 4 Suspicious Abnormality ? Biopsy Should Be Considered 
Category 5 Highly Suggestive of Malignancy ? Appropriate Action Should Be Taken 

Category 0 is a temporary category that means additional imaging is needed before assigning a permanent BI-RADS? assessment category. Most category 0 findings are shown to be benign after the additional imaging is completed.

The BI-RADS? categories or levels are used to standardize interpretation of mammograms among radiologists. They are useful for statistical analysis of mammography practice and BI-RADS? results are compiled on a nationwide basis in the U.S. to help refine mammography procedures everywhere. 

Hope this helps,

							The onc I had is considered top of the line... a good person, and I know he works very long hours. The docs I like, like him.... the patients I know love him... 

I couldn't find a wavelength we could genuinely communicate on other than polite exchanges. I believe that a patient with bc should receive at the bare minimum the basic written information about their own cancer characteristics and the choices that are recommended, without having to specifically ask for each piece. I received no explanations and no written information, just the verbal recommendation for CAF x 6 followed by rads and tamoxifen.

I feel that chemo was recommended for me without any understanding at all in terms of who I am as a total human being, which is much more than simply a live organism that possibly still contains cancerous cells after surgery.

I may not be the best person to ask. Maybe Leo can help answer your question too.

I wasn't afraid of losing my hair, or of vomiting, etc. I just do not understand, when a person chooses not to do chemo and then sometimes ends up having a recurrence or metastasis, why it is so automatic to assume that if they had done chemo they would not have had a recurrence or metastasis.... I see those who chose to do chemo constantly having recurrences and metastasis, but instead of blaming that on the chemo that they have had, established medicine usually wants them to do MORE chemo. I also see quite often those who have had chemo and have had recurrence and then have amother chemo regimen frequently go into very rapid decline. I can't get a straight answer about any genuine maintenance of information about how people who have chosen not to do chemo have done in terms of survival or recurrence.

I did chemo strictly on a one-time basis out of respect for my family's wishes and the recommendation of my internist.

							My MIL had breast cancer 4 yrs ago and had a port put into recieve her meds. She also had a mastecomy (sp?). My question is this, does the port stay in forever or should it be removed?

Also does anyone know if ther is a place that helps with the cost of a prosthesis, hers is 4 yrs old and is starting to leak and as she is on a limited income, she has no way to pay for a new one.

							Bekah,  If your mil has had her port for four years then the answer is that she can have that removed at any time.  I personally have had my port now for over 5 years. However I hate IV's and maintain it by having it flushed every month.  I hope that she has hers flushed monthly too.  Insurance should cover the cost of her prothesis and they should also pay for mastectomy bras as well... I can get mine replaced every one or two years.  however, I have one prosthesis that I have used for years now.. it is called a boosom buddy, the most comfortable that I have ever found and it was also the least expensive, I actually bought it myself.  at any rate... they also have them in the TLC catalog at reasonable prices as well.  She should however make an appointment with a person who will fit her for the prosthesis and tell her exactly what size she needs... they will also help with the insurance papers depending on the insurance that she has.  Any other questions please post them so that we can help her to find one that is not leaking.  If you have any specific questions please feel free to email me at BFagan2067@aol.com  just make sure that you put the cancer forum in the subject line so that I will know to open it.. Best of luck to you and your MIL!

							The ins. my MIL has is medicare, she is on disability, and the medicare just kicked in, she is unsure as of yet, what they will not pay or pay for. 
About her port, she wasn't even told the it should be flushed. I tole her about a friend that had one and that it got infected, because she was unable to get it flushed (due to other health isues), and my MIL was very surprised to hear that it should be flushed monthly, when she asked the drs. they told her that it should be flushed, but it was ok to do it every 3-4 mths. 
Let me tell you I have been very unimpressed by her cancer care, since wshe was uninnsured at the time of her diagnosis, she had to go on indigent care, and I think one of the reasons she had a mastecomy,is they didn't want to pay for the prolonged treatment of trying to rid her of the cancer cells,(just my opinion).

Does anyone know if medicare will pay for prothesis?

Or for a port removal?

Thanks so much for any information, my MIL has no computer, so she has no way to ask these ?'s, and I am not sure if she would anyway, she is very private about these things, and wiol even put herself in joepardy at times.

							Hello

It is excellent that ports can be kept in for a long time, and the risk of infection is low. But if there is no plan to use it the best option is to pull. Low risk does not equal zero, and an infection in a port like that is a big deal...you will not only need it taken out urgently, but you will need to be admitted and put on IV antibiotics. If you need it, keep it in. If it's not being used at all, why take the risk.  My 2 cents.

							Bekah,  Medicare should pay to have her port removed.  I can't really tell you about the flushing stuff as that my onc and onc nurses have always gone with the once a month flush.  Which I follow all the time.  I also have crohns disease and due to my staging with the breast cancer and various other problems I use my port all the time for different tests... just used it monday for a cat scan of my abdomin and pelvis area.  I will also use it on friday for my much dreaded colonoscopy.  I aLso believe that the medicare will also pay for a prosthesis... so you need to encourage your mother in law to contact a place that fits prosthesis, usually a medical supply place, or even a mastectomy boutiique.. my daughter lives in chicago and she tells me that the department stores there also have mastectomy shops , but none the less she needs to be fitted and also needs to find out what the medicare will cover for her prosthesis and mastecomy bras.  Feel free to email me and maybe I can help you out..  Bfagan2067@aol.com just make sure that you put the forum in your subject line  so that I will open it.
   Leo, you do mean that you have to be admitted and put on IV antibiotics to have it pulled should you have an infection right?  not just to have it removed right?  
    I will also add that I love my port and always treat it kindly    
     Best of luck to your mother in law.. and I hope she appreciates how much you care for her and how wonderful you are to be researching all of this for her!

							My surgeon removed my port at his office.  It only took about 10 minutes.  I must say, though, that it hurt A LOT! with about 5 needle insertions to numb the area.  Once I was numbed it was OK.  I would have preferred that he used some kind of sedative or topical cream like Lidocaine before the needle insertions.  Anyway, it was a simple procedure.  My skin had grown to it after 6 months and that was the most difficult part.

							Hi, my name is Mary and I am hoping someone can give me some guidance. My partner, Peter was diagnosed with Dukes C rectal cancer in January 2004.  In March 2004 he had a colostomy. 4 lymph nodes were removed and cancer was located in 2 of the 4.  To complicate matters Peter is a kidney transplant patient that survived dialysis for almost thirty years before receiving a kidney from his brother approximately 7 years ago.  Peter is 47 year old.  Peter is not receiving chemotherapy or radiation due to the kidney transplant and the loss of the kidney would require dialysis again and no one seems to think he is strong enough for that.. I have found numerous articles about survival rates with chemotherapy but have not been able to locate anything for someone not receiving chemo and with the kidney transplant issue. The drug he takes to keep his body from rejecting the kidney, PROGRAF, is known to increase the risk for rectal cancer. He still takes that drug to keep from rejecting the kidney. He has started to be very tired and the oncologist has started injections of PROCRIT and stated that the kidney may be ""slowing down"". The oncologist has not been able to answer any questions as to what the prognosis for Peter is. I am just wanting to know what to expect. I would love to just blindly believe that since the surgery all will be just fine but his skin color is very drab, he is very tired and I am concerned. Can anyone help me? I apologize for this wordy post and I would appreciate any input. I am a very strong person and would just like someone to be honest with me, good or bad.  Thank you and God Bless.

							Hello

Thanks for posting. The big problem with giving a prognosis is that your partner is undergoing a modified treatment regimen. Al studies that have been done have used other regimens, and the prognosis from the studies can not be extrapolated to your partner. On top of it what makes it more difficult is the kidney transplant and the medications he is on. I am being honest just like you asked, but I have no answers regarding prognosis. His fatigue can be explained by a number of things, including his kidney getting worse. In every study with cancer, renal failure is a bad prognostic factor, that is why the doctors were particularly concerned with keeping his kidney healthy.

							Hello everyone,

I just needed to sit down and write everything out so that I can deal with it.  Hope you guys don't mind.

I'm going in the morning for another biopsy.  I'm not sure why they are doing another one because they are already sure that I have cancer and I'm having surgery next week.  MRM on the right and a simple mastectomy on the left.  Anyway, the answer I'm getting is that the biopsy was done on the lymph node and they want to find the primary site.  They have pretty good idea where the primary is.  Anyway, I figured they could do all that at the surgery but I think that's just because I don't like needles and I'm trying to make it easier on me.

My surgery is scheduled for next Thursday, the 9th.  And the closer that day gets, the more nervous I'm becoming.  I know this may be a silly question, but when you wake up from mastectomy  surgery, do you miss them??  I know that I'm doing the right thing and I know that I will deal with it, but I'm just wondering.

I also have a bunch of questions about chemo.  I'm hoping they will wait til after Christmas for that.  How long after surgery do they typically begin chemo?  I'm already getting worried about losing my hair.  I know that's a small thing in the big scheme of things but still....

Anyway....trying to take one thing at a time....

Shelly

							I was reading your post and wanted to send good vibes your way for the upcoming surgery.

Of course you are nervous-it is a tough operation.  I had bi-lateral masectomies in May 04' IDC left breast and DCIS right); immediate reconstruction (expanders) and pretty much was laid up for 5 weeks.  I had 4 drains in each side (pain the you know what).  Women are tough though and I am sure you will do fine.

Some suggestions; I made sure you get some loose fitting men's shirts ( like pajama tops) and pretty much lived in those for weeks.  My fiancee' really kept up with the drains-every four hours he stripped them which really aided in my healing.  I religiously did the exercises; I had alot of muscle spasms on my left side and as much as it hurt I think it helped the healinfg process as well.  Baby yourself the first few weeks, eat well and if you have a recliner use that for aehile instead of a bed.

As far as chemo, my onc said the timeline is 8 weeks after the surgery.  I opted for no chemo (personal decision), but I had cancer before and lost all my hair which was long, blonde..and well you get the picture.  I lost it all and it was kinda odd being bald.  It grew back tho--even thicker!!

Big hugs to you.....Lorie

							Hi Shelley,

I was diagnosed in September with bilateral breast cancer, so I had no choice but to have double mastectomy. I had that done on October 20th. I was pretty medicated but I do remember laying my arm across my chest just after my surgery at not feeling the warmth of my breasts. It was a strange and sad feeling that I quickly got over considering I was now fighting for my life. I had extensive nodal involvement on both sides and large tumors as well. My first chemo treatment was November 22nd, which was 4 and one half weeks post surgery. I had a port put in a few days before, and because of the bilateral mastectomy, there wasn't really a place to insert the port that wasn't already traumatized from the initial surgery. As a result, even though I've had the port for over two weeks now, the area is bruised and still sore. I went to surgeon for follow up visit yesterday and he said, I'm just taking a longer time than usual to heal, but I did have alot of damage done with the bilateral. So, for you, hopefully the recovery time will be shorter. 
My first chemo was not good but it wasn't as bad as I had expected. My dad had it alot worse for his renal cell chemo treatments. I felt yucky through Thanksgiving weekend, but feel good this week. I still have my hair, but expect to lose it by Monday the latest, when I have my second round of chemo. I have chemo every other Monday as part of a dose-dense protocol. 
As far as the emotional roller coaster goes, I'm on it. 99% of the time I'm just moving forward and going with the flow. 1% of the time I am in my shower as the tears roll down my face. I couldn't afford reconstruction and sometimes when I look in the mirror it all comes rushing over me and it is more than I can bare. I don't have this feeling too often because I force myself to move on. I turned 45 after my surgery and before my first chemo.  I was going to school part time and working part time so I didn't have health insurance.

I hope I was able to help you in some way. Take care,

I had my biopsy today.  They were originally planning to biopsy both sides but they were unable to find anything on the right other than the lymph node that had already been biopsied, so they just did the left.  When I asked about that, they said that the primary tumor may possibly be hidden behing my lymph node in the axilla tail (I think that is what they called it).  The lymph node is swollen so big that they cannot see what is behind it.  Anyway, because of that lymph node, they are 99% sure there is cancer in the right breast.  Surgery is scheduled for next Thursday.  I'm just ready to get it overwith.

This is a very difficult question. Older patients have a good prognosis. As a matter of fact, the patient you are talking about is 26. As far as potential for other tumors, he is at risk of developing meningiomas, nerve sheath tumors, and possibly malignant glioma with cranial or craniospinal radiation therapy. He should be monitored for life.

							Hi:  I read your message about your 26 year old son.  My husband was diagnosed with a Medulloblastoma at the age of 30 and just celebrated his 50th birthday with no recurrance and no other cancers having shown up.  He had radiation treatment of his tumor and spinal column  but not chemo.    They were only able to remove 10% of the tumor with surgery and took care of the rest with the radiation.  
He has health problems because of the high dose of steriods they gave him which damaged his joints  (avascular necrosis) but they tell us that is an extremely rare side affect.  Those problems surfaced within a couple years of his treatment so I don't think you have to worry about that now.  
Thats what we experienced and I just wanted  to share.
						

"
"


							From what I've read,  medulloblastoma seems to follow Collins Law which is very simply that you can be considered cured once you have lived your diagnosis age over again. So by 28 he would be considered cured, but you should keep monitoring because there have been cases that don't follow the rule, and chemo and radiation put you at greater risk of other cancers. I would say at 12 years out you don't need to worry too much (but then I'm just a patient - not a doctor).

							Hello

This is only a general layout of your chest, used to guide the radiologist to where to scan, where to start the scan, etc. This is not looked at for diagnosis, only the cross-sections are used. I can not answer what you are looking at, but I would leave it to the radiologist. There are a lot of nuances that are difficult to interpret, so anyone that is not trained to do this should not try to interpret scans. Like you said, your doctor should have explained to you in general terms, the nodule, etc.

You're right, the outlining that they get which looks like a chest x-ray is only to orient people. All CT scans have one of those.

Good news is that there are no FDG avid malignancies! 

I have one more problem though.  There is FDG activity, which, as you know, can have various causes.

Presently I am trying to find a PET/CAT specialist who might be able to give us some ideas as to what the increased activity is.  I do have the studies on disc.  Would you happen to know where I can send them to have them analyzed  as to the possible causes of this activity?  Basically, it would almost be like a second opinion, but  with more specific information on the secondary reasons for this uptake.  I would, of course pay for this report/second opinion.

I did discuss this with my doctor and he didn't, at present, have any recommendations of experts in the field of PeT/CAT studies.  I told him I would try to get some names but now realize, I don't really know exactly who I am looking for and what their title would be.  Nor do I know , as a layperson, how to find experts in this field.  I do know that I would want someone not involved in our health care system.  I would want someone who is out of the HUP health care system, probably out of the state of PA.

							Hello

You could try to send it to Mayo Clinic to be read. But I am not sure if this will help, since the radiologist will only detail what he sees, and can only speculate what that is. What you might really need is a clinician who can review your case with you and give you an opinion on what he thinks it might be and what to do.

Just being able to ""talk"" to someone about different situations -- to ""vent"", as it were -- can do wonders to a person under a lot of pressure and stress (whether they are sick, or they have a loved one who is sick...). I want to take this opportunity to thank you for this service that you are providing here. I want to put this website URL into my website which I am not making public for personal reasons, but it really needs to be there. Contact me with URL info is it's different than, ""www.cancerforums.net"", and I'll make certain it's correct on my site. If you contact me at my e-mail address, I'll be glad to explain why my site is ""private"", and why your site is so valuable there. You'll understand in a heartbeat! Again, thanks so much for your time and energy in this endeavor. What a miracle of sorts this is.  Very Sincerely, Bazil Rhodes

							The urologist assured us he removed a 'cyst' from my father's scrotum but pathology came back 'sarcoma.'  We've been waiting for a plan for my father's tx for over a week and we're getting very anxious.   The urologist said it is not a common type of cancer and very rare to be found in the scrotum.  I worry because he is not familiar with this scrotal sarcoma and   I wonder where dad can get the best care.

I appreciate your kind words. Sarcomas have variable presentations. Some grow very rapidly, while others are more indolent. Again, we can't know how it will behave unless we have the right diagnosis. I am hoping that they will review the slides and come up with an answer ASAP.

							Hey All,
Dad's urologist called today.  He was told that his cancer most resembled spindle cell.  Every website I go to makes me more depressed.  But the good new is, he's sees an oncologist on Tuesday, at least we're finally physically starting the battle.
I want to take him to Sloan Kettering and MD Anderson has been mentioned.
Websites, I know, are as good as the webmaster who designed them, but I've heard these are 2 hospitals who aggressively treat sarcomas.  Has anyone had any experience with either of the 2?  Leo, I don't know if you're allowed to say, but if so, do you have a preference?  Or is there someplace else, that is even better?  My parents live in Ohio, I live in Texas but am quite comfortable in Manhattan.  I will stay with my parents if I get them out of Dayton.  (unless of course, they prefer to be alone)

							Well, Harvard tells the urologist dad's cancer is so rare they would like to be kept up to date on everything.  We were told he's in the Intermediate Stage.
Dad is bulking at leaving his home and going to Sloan or MD Anderson and I can understand that from the point of a 72 yr old man.  But the nurse in me says why let a rookie do the job when you can go to the big hitters.  But the last thing I'd want to do is upset my dad, because his head is already spinning and he's educated himself enough to be very scared.

							My father was diagnosed with cancer 5 months ago now. He had surgery to remove two tumours from his upper bowel, and numerous smaller cancers from his abdominal cavity. Numerous lymph nodes were also removed, all positive for cancer.

I live half a country away (my family are on the west coast, I am on the east coast of Australia) and I am finding it difficult to get real information from them. My parents dont wish to worry me.

Dad has had a quad bypass some ten years ago now, and was already on numerous meds for his heart and back conditions.

Chemo was started 4 months ago, but has failed to have any affect.

My Mum called me a couple of days ago to tell me that Dad is getting sicker. There are now approx 5 tennis-ball sized tumours - bowel and abdomin - and signs that it has spread to the liver and possibly lungs. He is on oxygen now also.

I am told that the oncologist has determined that there is no further treatment that can be done, and that now it is just a matter of time. Dad's pain is getting worse.

I am scared of not being there for him when he needs me the most, as the family support system is not so good.

Is there any way that one can estimate the time left? I cannot afford to fly over there more than once in twelve months (return flight around a months wages when flying on short notice) and either way will lose my job when I go.

  Hello, I am so pleased to have found this site. I am almost 41 yrs old and I have stage 4 osteosarcoma that has metatised(sp?) from my hip, to my spine, to my lung. I have searched for a cancer forum, I live in the middle of nowhere and there are few who don't turn up their noses at me. I am in a wheelchair and on O2, I went through 3 back surgeries before they noticed the 7 tumors on my hip/lower spine, they surgically fused S-1,to L-4, it didn't hold, as soon as cancer hit there, the fusion started slipping. I live in constant pain, and my life has change so much in the past 7-8 months. This is when I found out I'd be a full-timer with thee chair, and was told ""learn to live with it"". Well, I'm not doing so good at it, it's frustrating when everything I need is out of reach so my babies(7&4) can't hurt themselves, yet makes it almost impossible for me to function half way normally, and that's not when I'm drugged out of my mind, I have 2 caregivers that take turns caring for me so you'd think it would be easy, no way!! Well, I have bored you long enough with my story, might I have the pleasure of hearing yours? I enjoy talking with people, they sometimes help me see the forest through the trees, so to speak.

							Hi, Angelred,
I'm having trouble posting messages, but will try this again, so if the other shows up later and repeats information here, you'll know why!

Your post moved me and I'd love to keep you and your family in my prayers if you'd like.  My experience is with breast cancer which, though it's led to lymphedema, is not so disabling as your situation.  I've had two mastectomies, chemo, radiation, and am now on hormonal therapy.  Also developed some heart rate problems from the chemo drugs, but that's easier to control than the lymphedema, which involves ongoing therapy, self-management, special exercises, and compression garments (arm, hand, and chest).

I have two kids at home as well, though they're older than yours--24 and 25--both learning disabled, one (Dara) with diabetes since age 15 months, the other (Tony) autistic.   They're such a gift, keep me from focusing exclusively on myself and offer so much love, but they're also the source of my major frustration: not being able to care for them the way I'd like.  My husband has been wonderful and I certainly hope you have some such support as well (do you?), though I do understand it's rare.

I wondered if you'd had anyone come to your home and help you to make it more efficient for your situation.  I'm not sure if that would be an OT, a public health nurse, or a specialized social worker, but I'm willing to bet there's somebody in your state/city/community whose job it is to do just that.  They can often suggest simple things that make specific jobs easier, or even offer suggestions for financing bigger alterations as needed.  If you can connect with someone like that they can make a big difference in your sense of independence and potential.

I'm praying that there will be some moment today of special satisfaction and joy that'll give you a real lift,

							I know someone who was diagnosed with a GBM recently.  The prognosis is not good.    I have been doing some research online to try and find some information to give some hope, but instead I am getting the impression that this is a very bad kind of cancer.   Does anyone survive this?  How many live 5 years?  10 years?   The doctor has recommended Temodar (sp?) chemotherapy and radiation.  Are there any new or better treatments available if this doesn't work?   Thanks for any info you can provide.
						

"
"


							Hello

Unfortunately GBM has a long history of unfruitful studies, and very little improvement in prognosis over several years. The treatment that was recommended is the standard of care, and there is nothing better currently available...

The 2 year survival rate is about 9%, 5 year: 3% and 10 years around 1.7%. The big problem with glioblastoma is the aggressiveness of the tumor, and the difficulty of drug penetrating the brain tissue.

							HI Lorelei,

I just happen to come across your post as I was logging into the breast cancer board.  I just wanted to let you know about the American Cancer Society site.  I know of two people on the brain cancer discussion board  with gbm both of whom were dx at about the same time and live almost in the same area.  Both men in their early 50's were dx in early 2003 (i think).  Anyway I highly suggest going to that site as there are a lot of posts in the brain cancer board.  Also there is a live chat there too!  
I am afraid what Leo says is holding pretty true for GBM patients, its very sad.

							dolittle: whether rt will work from your dad's brain tumor depends on the diagnosis. if the disease is a mets from another organ (e.g., lung), radiation will provide palliation. if it is a GBM or other primary brain tumor, radiation only helps the symptoms too unless a special type of radiotherapy, stereotactic radiosurgery, is used. 
you should talk to your dad's doctor to find out the diagnosis and th purpose of the treatment first. his radiation oncologist should have all info you need to know.

I was diagnosed with Prostate Cancer 6 years ago at the age of 46.  My father died very quickly from this cancer and it was a painful experience watching him die.

I realised at that point that I had to personally manage the entire matter of the disease and treatment options available because no doctor was going to be able to tell me what to do. The decisions about treatment of any cancer are very much realted to its stage, the patients age and the general prognosis. I was fortunate in that my insurance plan allowed me to seek opinions and I visited both John Hopkins/Baltimore and the nearer MD Anderson Hospital in Houston. After reading and collwecting data and opinions, I eventually elected for a radacal prostatectomy which I had carried out at MD Anderson.

What was not available to me during that time, or what I did not consider so much was the effect of the surgery, and wish in hindsight that I had been able to talk to people who had similar pathology and stage of the cancer and treatment.  Not that I regret my decision, but at these times there is so much information to absorb and consider that its very difficult to know which way to ""jump""

My entire surgery was successful and to date my PSA remains undetectable, and for that I am grateful. Most people do not know or need to know about my experience, and I lead a pretty normal life.

During the period of diagnosis and discovery, I went through some very tough times, and there was no one to turn to, other than my doctor, who could only be just that - a doctor.  I'd like to offer to assist anyone out there who needs to talk, and I'd be happy to share my own personal experiences and the practical knowledge that I gained.

Procrit is a drug that essentially makes the bone marrow produce more red cells. Very useful for people with renal failure on hemodialysis, because the kidney is no longer producing erythropoietin, which is the same as Procrit. Other uses are for people who get chemotherapy, and need a boost for their bone marrow to get the red cells up. It will not work well for those who have diseases of the bone marrow. But there are exceptions.

I understand that since her death at least one study has demonstrated a link between acromegaly and colon cancer.

They have to give her tylenol every four hours or she will fever highly again. Today they are going to start giving her Motrin instead so that she does'nt get any liver damage from the tylenol. She sleeps all the time, weighs 93 lbs. and has water retention in her right leg now. They have run every test imaginable and say that they cannot find any infection anywhere that would be causing the fevers. They are totally at a standstill now and do not know what is causing this.

							Hello

Lymphomas such as hers can cause ""tumor fevers"", when the cancer itself provokes very high fevers, but the doctors are right to rule out an infectious cause for this. If the case is really tumor fevers, the only thing to treat that is to treat the cancer itself.

							I really wish they had put me in a regular cast, but I understand why they made this funky one since it was on the MRM side and tried everything to avoid lymphadema.  It keeps it from moving alot, but there have been several times I did something that I know I shouldn't have because I found out the hard way.  I should know alot more Thur. when I see the surgeon.  I'm sure he'll take all this off to look at it and he just better give me time to scratch before he puts anything back on if he's going to.  Nothing like having an itch and can't get to it.....LOL

							Hello

It can not confirm, but it indicates that it is probably related to inflammation anywhere along the urologic tract. Cancer most often causes obtruction of the urethra by compressing it, and may facilitate the development of infection due to the urine accumulating in the bladder.

							Hi, I really don't want to sound like a hypochondriac here, but I am at the edge of my wits with worry. I found a large lump on my ribcage about 4 months ago, and it has gotten a tiny bit bigger since then, but not much. My problem is I go to school full time, and dont have health insurance. I went to the University Health Center, and the doctor there said that my lump was swollen cartilage from a severe rib trauma. It hurts when it is poked, but other than that it does not hurt. I can roll over on it, it doesnt hurt when i touch it, just when I poke hard. But this is inconsistent with a cartilage inflammation, becuase that is supposed to be excrutiatingly painful.  And my biggest problem with his diagnosis is that I have never had severe rib trauma. My rib didnt hurt before I found this, I was not in a car accident or wrestling with my friends or anything. I dont play sports, I definitely would have noticed breaking or severely traumatizing my ribcage. 
The lump is right on the edge of my ribs on my left side, right under my breast, and it is very noticeable, even from a distance. 
I just do not accept his theory, but he seemed totally convinced that that's what it was...the possibility that it was anything more serious never crossed his mind. It only hurts when I breathe occasionally, and when it does hurt it isnt the lump that hurts, I get a sharp pain in my lung area. 
I very concerned about this, and am not sure what to do. I am supporting myself and paying for school, and have no health insurance.  And I am only 20 years old. I am anemic and hypoglycemic if that helps, but I dont think that has anything to do with it?
Please someone help if you can!

							Hello

Thanks for posting. I don't think you're hypochondriac. You have a real problem and you should be evaluated, regardless of your health insurance status. I know it can be costly, but this can be a big problem. The odds are that it is not going to be anything seroius, but without being checked you can never know. You could also speak to the County social worker to see if they have any clinic you could go to and be evaluated.

							Hi Aggie,

 Our bodies are crazy and do crazy things.  Leo is right its probably nothing but you will be in the hospital for all the stress related problems if you dont have it checked again.  One more thing,  If you do not have your health, you do not have anything.  Try very hard to get some kind of low income health insurance.  I dont know what state you are in but, for example, in California we have Medi Cal.  My husband and I put off Health Insurance for years.  There was always something more important to spend our money on (we thought).  Well, we finally got it and two months after, my husband was diagnosed with cancer.  We would have lost everything if we didnt have health insurance.  This is not a lecture, just some advice from someone who almost learned the hard way.

							Just my opinion, but if there was something out there to stop us from losing our hair during chemo or helping it to grow up faster, we would all know about it and especially the oncologist.  I think the key word in that is that this guy SELLS books.  There is a vitamin called biotin that helps with hair growth and has been known to for years, but nothing that makes it come back quicker then the 1/2 "" a month average, but helps for it to come in healthier.  I took that and never noticed a difference even.  I don't know about everyone else, but I actually measured my hair to make sure I was getting my 1/2"" a month... lol  and there were a few times that I would have spurts where it seemed to come in faster.  It's hard to believe now, but it will be back before you know it.  My last chemo was 2 years ago this last June and it's half way down my back again and have actually had 2 hair cuts.

Thanks for posting. I agree that we should look for the best person that can treat us. Anyone is entitled to get more opinions on their problem. Unfortunately, for GBMs, the resectability of a tumor is straight-forward, and for best chances radical resection is required. Even with that, there is a good chance of relapse.

							With the exception of Leo, the others who replied have named 3 of the 4 or 5 best hospitals in the world (I do not know the doctors so I cannot comment on them). But there are some other things you and your brother must consider. Distance from home and family is one of the biggest issues to consider. Could you and your family get back and forth between NC ad CA or NY as easily as you can get to Duke? 

So much of these decisions are so personal that it is impossible to tell you ""who the best neurosurgeon in the world"" is. It could be that the surgeon in your town is ""the best"" for your brother, you, and your family. Only you can decide. 

Your brother is faced with one of the most difficult surgeries for any kind. As Leo said, it is not technically difficult. But the probability of it recurring is high.

							To characterize any one person as ""the best"" neurosurgeon is difficult. However, I've had the privilege to meet and work with one of the finest neurosurgeons in the world in my opinion. His name is Arthur Day and he's currently at Harvard. He's brilliant and has operated on some high profile celebrities including Ted Williams and he also performed a very secretive procedure on a very famous young actor with Parkinsons.....if you know who I mean.  He is widely regarded amongst highly accomplished surgeons to be a pioneer in his field and he has numerous patents on neurosurgical techniques and devices. Hope this helps.

							Since I saw Dr. Gutin's name already mentioned, I thought I would toss my two cents in. I just, last Thursday, had my second craniotomy with Dr. Gutin. The first time I was out of the hospital in four days and in grad school a month later. This time, my stay was two days. 

More than that, his confidence combined with his ability to provide a realistic assessment is both comforting and useful for making choices. 

After meeting with the Dean of Harvard Medical School and speaking with several other neurosurgeons, he was consistently labeled as the one I should go with. If not him, then Peter Black at MassGeneral in Boston. I was told by the Chief of Neuroncology at the National Cancer Institute that a positive relationship with one's surgeon was key to a successful outcome and that for at least for me, that meant looking no further than Dr. Gutin. 

As anyone asking that question knows, brain tumors are terrifying, it's how they kill people on TV shows. The bottom line is Dr. Gutin said everything would be fine, my family and I believed him, and it was and he didn't ever feed us unrealistic expectations.

							Hi this is my first time here. I found you through the cancer blog. My question is about the general articles referring to exposures to pesticides and benzenes. What kind of exposure are they referring to. Years, months, weeks, or one or two times ever. I have flowers and use fertilizer in my flower beds, I have been in a housefire and plastic curtains caught on fire and burned. I got a lot of smoke in my lungs and had laryngitis for quite a while. This was years ago. I am not worried for me, but aggravated by the general references. Another question is about the severity of symptoms. So many times articles about Lymphoma refer to mild symptoms but do not say whether the symptoms are enough to interfere with daily life or if you have to search and search to be aware of them. 
The reason I ask these questions is because I do a lot of general education in my job with people who may never see a doctor for health reasons unless I can convince them. I see a lot of cases of drug related illnesses where I work.

Thanks for posting. All these articles refer to chronic exposure to carcinogenic chemicals. For someone that is occasionally exposed it is not a big deal. The same with asbestos, for example, people that develop mesothelioma due to asbestos are usually people that work with this compound, miners or people that worked in factories where asbestos was extensively used. As far as benzene and pesticides, the best you can do is to use a good mask and gloves when handling the product. Avoid unnecessary contact. This applies to all chemicals, as a matter of fact. We never know what we may discover in the future with chemicals we have been using for a while.

As far as lymphoma, usually the symptoms are: enlarged lymphnodes, night sweats, weight loss, fevers. But these are not specific, as this may be difficult to diagnose at times.

							Hello

We usually check the liver function to see if patients are able to receive some forms of chemotherapy, as this can be toxic to the liver. So if you have liver problems prior to chemo, we need to either think about a different drug or reduce the doses. The second set of labs looks actually better than the first one. Doctors will follow it and make sure that his liver is tolerating the chemotherapy.

I have an annual mammogram, and fret a lot until the post card comes saying everything is all right. I do regular breast self exams. It's hard to tell what's under the skin where I had lumpectomy. I've had a second biopsy in the same area, and there is scar tissue from the surgeon mucking about to make sure nothing else was there. I see my PCP (primary care physican) annually and get a lecture about how I need to lose weight (tell me something I don't know   ), and I see my oncologist once a year. He has blood drawn for a series of tests he calls a ""cancer panel."" So far, in eight years, nothing is amiss. That's about it. I take meds for underactive thyroid, an antidepressan, a low-dose diuretic to help with blood pressure, Lipitor for my cholesterol (genetically elativated) and Fosomax for my thinning bones. Other than that, I am all right.    Hope you are having a good week. Welcome to the board. Hugs, Lauri

							My 67-year-old father was recently diagnosed with AML and went through the first round of chemo.  We got the result of a post-chemo bone marrow biopsy yesterday, and it was reported to us that his AML is in remission, but he has myelodisplastic cells (and he hasn't been able to maintain normal levels of white or red blood cells on his own, but is well enough to be out of the hospital with transfusions and supportive care).  We don't know what that means in terms of prognosis, except that it seems to be one of the worst scenarios.  Information that we can find about MDS discusses the possibility of devleping AML.  Does it mean that he had undiagnosed MDS that has already progressed to AML?  How does that compare to AML with myelodisplastic cells?  What is the prognosis?  How long do most people survive?
						

"
"


							Hello

Thanks for posting. Like you said, when someone with MDS evolves to AML it is pretty bad. It tends to be very aggressive. Nonetheless, after someone receives chemotherapy it is difficult to interpret the findings in the bone marrow. If it was thought by the doctors that his AML was one that progressed from MDS, it is likely that he had MDS for many years, and this is  not easy to diagnose until it gets fairly advanced and the bone marrow starts to fail. It is impossible to tell you about a prognosis for our father, since I don't know what he has, because the are so many details such as cytogenetics and specific bone marrow features that modify his prognosis. You should talk to his hematologist about this. Regardless, the only established cure is an allogeneic bone marrow transplant, and unfortunately he is not a candidate for this given his age. But we never know who will do well. Maybe he will stay in remission for a long time, but we never know for sure.

							This was all over the news yesterday here in the UK - I think they always over-emphasise the potential benefit, but nevertheless it is there. I just have to try and convince my oncologist to switch me over from tamoxifen to arimidex - I have been trying (unsuccessfully) for over 2 years. She keeps saying ""not enough long-term reporting"", but now surely this will be enough? No doubt our socialised, and therefore free, Health Service will put a block on switching women from a drug that costs 25 per annum to one that costs 1000 ; but I intend to persuade her if I can .

							My onco started me on Tamoxifen after my dx in 2002.  I asked about Arimidex and he said the same thing yours did.  After 6 months and confirming that chemo had put me into MENTALpause, he told me that it looked like it was superior to Tamoxifen, but with me being Stage III, that if I wanted to switch, he was with me on it.  It was a scary decision of course, but my gut said to do it, so I did and almost 3 years later, so far so good.
I definately don't think it has put you at risk.  Alot of studies showed that being on Tamoxefin for 2 years and then switching, had a higher survival rate without a reoccurence, then the Tamoxefin for 5 years.  You've done good so far, so switching now gives you 5 more years that you're taking something to hopefully prevent the beast from coming back.  Mine is going to have a hard time getting me to stop in 3 more years (I pray this crap stays away!!!!).  Hopefully by then they will know more.  This black cloud always over our head really sucks, just like the disease, but thank God we're hanging with NED

   HI,

I HAVE BEEN ON ARIMIDEX FOR 2 YEARS NOW. I WAS NEVER ON TAMO. SINCE I TAKE BLOOD THINNERS I COULD NOT TAKE THAT ONE. WHAT I HAD SEEN ON THE NEWS WAS THAT THE ARIMIDEX HAD PROVED TO WORK BETTER IN OLDER WOMEN BUT STILL NOT ENOUGH STUDY TO KNOW ABOUT HOW IS WAS ON YOUNGER WOMEN.  SINCE I AM 60 I GUESS I FALL INTO THE OLDER GROUP.  MY DOCTOR HAS SAID I WOULD BE ON THIS FOR 5 YEARS.  WHAT THEN    


"
"


							Originally, if I'm not mistaken, the 1st studies for Arimidex were for ""advanced"" stage ladies, then it went to early stage, etc.  I think studies have been done on just about every aspect, age, 1st or 2nd line of treatment etc.  The link I sent has just about everything they have done trials on.  I've been on it 2 years also and started when I was almost 44.  
We both have 3 years to go on Arimidex and hopefully they will something else for us to follow up with.  I think I read that the government or whatever funding only allowed 5 year studies, so I have no idea if there is benefit to taking it more then 5 years of if they even know.  Like I said, if I make it to 5 years NED, which will still give me about a year left on Arimidex, me and my onco are going to go round and round because I won't want to quit taking it regardless of the cost.  
We just have to pray that they will come up with something even better by then.  This black cloud always hanging over our heads to me makes it impossible to have a ""normal"" life, even though I don't think about it 24/7, you sure can't forget it.

							Hello

This topic is obviously very controversial. The ATAC Trial that was published this week is one of the pieces of evidence that supports aromatase inhibitors as first choice. Yes, the study being funded by the manufacturer may weaken the strength of the evidence, but it is there. The recommendations are based on guidelines. Guidelines change whenever the committee meets and re-evaluates the available literature. Some are convinced, while others are not. You will find a lot of controversy about this, but it seems that aromatase inhibitors are superior. We will see what the experts recommend with new guidelines coming out in the future.

							Hi
I am a doctoral student in medical sociology program at Case Western Reserve University. I am conducting my dissertation research about cancer patients' experiences during their illness and about their participation in online support groups. The research is approved by the Institutional Review Board of Case Western Reserve University. 

I would like to invite volunteer respondents to participate in the research by filling out a one-time online questionnaire which approximately takes 10-15 minutes. You will be making an important contribution to the study with your responses. 

You can have more information about the study and access to the questionnaire at https://home.cwru.edu/~gxs48/surveyintro.htm

							Hi, I had a mole above my right breast removed for biopsy, it came back with questionable cells. They went back and removed more under the cells. I have about a one inch scar from it. It's been well over 2 years since all of this but the scar is very very sensitive still. It also makes the right side of my chest hurt to touch. Is this a normal side effect? And also, does this mean I have an increased risk for breast or other cancer in this area? 

Thank you,

An excisional skin biopsy such as the one you had can develop pain for prolonged periods of time. This is uncommon, most people that have a biopsy do well. What you are having is not a normal thing, you are the exception to the rule. You can seek professional help with doctors that treat pain, especially chronic pain. 

If what you had was only a mole and the cells were only suspicious, you should be looking for other areas on your skin, since this may happen again. As far as breast cancer it does not increase your chances.

							My Mom has been diagnosed with severe emphysema. The pulminary Dr. also found 4 nodules. Three in one lung , one in the other . She is very upset. I am trying to become informative and stay upbeat for her. It's tough to do . She's always on my mind.. She lives 2200 miles away. Recently she came to visit and her health scared me so I had her promise to go to the dr. First her GP and now the specialist. She's scheduled for a ct w/ and w/o contrast and I am worried. Could any one please respond ?? Dad died in 1993 w/ brain c/a , 6 mos. later my 28 yr old sister was diagnosed with brain c/a in utero.I just can't stand the thought of my mother being this ill and possibly dying. She spoke of our recent time together, the laughing ect. It's painful and I feel like crying. I know she's very depressed and I'm headed that way. Looking for any responce. I love Mom so ....Jenny

I am sorry to hear about your mother. I think the best thing to do is to wait for the results of the CT. Until then, all we can say is ""nodules"", and only the CT will be able to define the characteristics and the likelihood (or not) of it being cancer. This certainly is a period of enormous anxiety, but try your best to keep your good energy !

Depending on the case you can be almost certain that it is fibrocystic disease. In younger patients, with breast tissue that is diffusely fibrocystic, with negative mammograms that is what usually happens.

							Hi Dr. Leo and Laura,
I had been told many times that my breasts were fibrocystic by my doctor who did exams by hand. Only when I got my first baseline did he discover that I didn't have that at all. It was not long after that my cancer was found. Maybe I am an unusual case. But if I knew a girl who had a lump and the doctor just went by feel I would tell her to get a mammo just to be on the safe side. I think after what happened to me I want to be checked every which way they can. I simply don't trust my body anymore. 
PS - I got a clear MRI on the Sclerotic Foci! He told me that they were ""unremarkable"" and that he will watch them carefully to see if they change in any way.

I am also one of those people, but fortunately my surgeon by feel and mamo and ultrasound thought it was nothing, it had none of the ""normal"" charateristics of cancer.  HOWEVER, he wanted it out anyway simply because he felt he could not rule it out 100% and also he thought if it ended up to be nothing, that at least it would be gone and not hide any potential future problems.  To this day, I thank God for a surgeon who was aggressive and not taking anychances...

							Well I went to see my Surgeon today and he wants my Port removed.
His thought is that Iam doing wonderful and all is over.
Iam on the 5 yr treatment of Arimidex and so I do not  Need the Port No longer. His worry is if a part of this breaks of inside then it can travel and go to the heart and that could be deadly.
So Iam with my Dr all the way.
I go on the 20th my birthday to get my nipple and tatto done and then following that the port will be pulled.
Then all this will be over and done, No looking back only looking forward to bigger and better things in the future. (2005)

							I'm still new to all of this, but I'm thinking that my port might stay in for a long time. Since I had bilateral mast. with nodes removed from both sides I'm concerned about lymphedema. (Granted I'm more concerned about recurrance but still, lymphedema is something I would like to avoid if possible). So, I was just thinking I would leave the port in, even though it still bothers me and it's been three weeks since I had it inserted. If I remove the port, how do I do blood draws that md or health care providers may want with annual check up or for other medical reasons?

In your case your port is still being used, so you have good reasons to keep it in. Only when the doctors know with good confidence that a port will not be needed they can take it out.

							Thanks Dr. Leo for your speedy reply. I should have indicated that my concern was for after all my treatments are done, say one year from now for a non cancer related routine blood test.  I had many nodes removed bilaterally and was advised to use legs for blood pressure, thighs or butt for needles and feet for IV's. No one advised on what I do for blood draws. Say for a regular checkup for cholesterol or what ever any md down the road might need blood for. Prior to having my port most techs looked at me in horror when I suggested drawing blood from my foot,  but can anyone other than an RN or MD access a port? If not, how do people with no ""good arm"" have blood drawn? Also, prior to having the port I did have IV's in foot and that was very painful, even with the emla cream. So, what will I do in the future regarding this, especially if I develop lymphedema?
Thanks,

							Jan

If that's the case, you will need blood draws and infusions from an unaffected limb, which means a foot. My understanding is that only RNs and MDs can access a port, as it requires more training, and believe me, you don't want to get those infected. It can be a very serious infection, and most often the port needs to be taken out.

First of all, odds are this is not cancer. It can be a hemorrhoid or a peri-rectal abscess. Rectal cancer would be very unlikely in your age group. But you need to be seen by a doctor so he/she can examine you.

I'll let Leo answer this one because I don't know, but what a great idea for your wife.  Even if she can't do it while on chemo, trust me, when treatment is over, she'll definately enjoy them then.  I've never gotten that kind of gift, but I can just imagine how great physically and emotionally it would feel to be pampered like that........ no doubt, whenever she can use them, that is the coolest gift you could have thought of.  Relaxing.......... oh, what a concept

As far as massage goes...well let me just say I treated myself and still do to a monthly massage.  It not only feels good, but it helps the mind and body to concentrate on healing and reduces stress.
I will let dr leo answer your questions too in regards to the spa, but massage therapy is great.

							Hey Pastor Rich

I hope things are well. Taking her to a spa sounds like a great deal. One concern that I have with whirlpool baths relates to a port (if she has it) or a PICC line. You should seek counselling with the people taking care of this if she is going to have whirlpool baths. It is probably ok, but it doesn't hurt to check.

Cathy is doing well. In fact, she was supposed to have the PICC installed before chemo last Friday, but the equipment was down. So instead of waiting, she went ahead with the bloodwork and the chemo without it.

The onc. nurse looked at her veins and said: ""why do you think you need a PICC?"" He had no trouble inserting the needle and attaching the line.

So Cathy probably will not have the PICC installed.

Also, the great news is that she has had virtually no nausea so far and it is now Saturday night. If she still had all her hair everything would seem to be normal!

							Hi Pastor Ritch,
So glad that Cathy is doing so well with her chemo.  For what it's worth, I didn't have a PICC or anything and had chemo and labs done each time because I HAD such good veins.  Chemo can and in my case did cause the veins to harden like scar tissue and chemo also causes the veins to roll.  Either though it's been over 2 years since I had any chemo, they have a hard time now getting a vein.  The bloodwork isn't so bad because they use butterfly needles, but for surgeries, I get stuck no less then twice and usually 3 times because of what the chemo did to my veins.  Just wanted to pass that along incase the onco still talks about a PICC line, she might want to consider it.

							Hi Pasor Rich and Nancy,

I just wanted to say I am glad your wife is doing so well.  I am out of treatment for one year dec 30 and never had a port or anything.  I had 4 cycles of A/C and 4 cycles of Taxol every two weeks.  They never once had trouble getting a vein ,along with the weekly blood work. (that was from June to Sept).  However, now when I have to have a line in for an MRI it takes about 5 tries so now I have to go up to the chemo nurses to get my line before the MRI and they can do it on the first shot!
Come to think of it, I was not even offered a port, I wonder why???  Heck, I didn't even know to ask about a port!
Best of luck to you all!

							Hi Pastor Rick,

I don't remember if your wife had lymph nodes removed but if she did then hot tubs are not recommened. The change in temperature causes the arm to swell slightly and with the loss of some nodes, it is taxing on the lymph system to remove the excess fluid. Over time, this can lead to lymphedema. At least that is what I have been reading. I don't have lymphedema and hope to avoid it, so I've been reading some about it.
I'm 20 days out from my second go around with dose dense chemo, my thick hair is now thin but most others wouldn't really notice it, I'm expecting it all to fall out sometime this week. Glad to hear Cathy is doing so well, Jan

							Hi, We had a family reunion at brother Bob's house this past Sat 12 04. He related well with all of the 25 relatives we had there and seemed in good spirits. He was in the end of his 5 th week of Temodar and  RT so he was tired. Since then Bob had some seziures that put him in the emergency room. Yesterday the 10th, when I talked to Bob on the phone he asked who I was 5 times, mid sentence his words turned to gibberess, could not hear/or understand me frequently,cried, and forgot what he was saying mid sentence! Is this an outcome of the treatment or failure of the treatment? If it is the later what other ways will the tumor growth effect his life and mental status? I live in NC and Bob lives in NY so I can't see him every day. Something seems to have gone very wrong and I'm scared! Should I go to him to be with him while he still knows me? Oh yeah, the hospital said Bob siziures was caused by a Dilantin  unbalance. Bob ripped the leads off himself and walked out of the hospital- he is 6'4"" and a strong, healthy man with his brain tumor( not a good thing to do but the hospital said was not unusal for a 1st seziure). I need help in understand what is going on and what to do next. Anyone? Thanks for listening and may all cancer patients and there families be at peace.

							Hello

I think it can be either thing. With treatment there may be a lot of tissue breakdown, which can cause some swelling of the surrounding brain tissue. But as you know, it may also be that his tumor is progressing. One thing is for sure, if he is developing all these problems, make sure there is someone with him at all times, as you never know what might happen. The course of these patients with high-grade brain tumors are quite unpredictable.

							I'm definitely not an expert, and all brain tumors effect everyone differently, as well as the treatments. But I agree with the last reply. My grandmother was diagnosed with a brain tumor just over 4 years ago and she had symptoms somewhat similar to your brother, for example getting into wrong cars in parking lots, putting her clothes on backwards, and losing a drive for knowledge that she'd had all of her life, but these all occured before the tumor was found. 
She never underwent any treatments other than the biopsy to diagnose it, because she never really woke up from the procedure. But during her more aware moment she didn't know who she or anyone else is. I don't want to scare you, not by any stretch of the imagination, but from the CAT scan until death we only had approx 6 weeks with my grandmother. If you're worried about it, or thinking about going to be with him, then my suggestion is to go. That way no matter what happens you will not have any regrets.

							Hello everyone,

I had my surgery on Thursday and came home yesterday.  The biggest problem I have is sleeping.  I normally sleep on my side or my stomach and that just isn't possible right now.  I did ok in the hospital but the bed was shaped kind of like a recliner.  Last night was my first night at home and I really had trouble sleeping.  I'm thinking the flat bed was the problem.  My husband is moving a recliner in tonight in case I need it.  Does anyone have any other suggestions?  I'm really not having too much trouble with pain...just that stinging sensation every now and then.  I don't like taking pain meds but I'm thinking I might take them at night so I can hopefully sleep.  

Anyway, I'm doing really well.  Didn't even shed a tear after surgery.  I was worried about how I would feel afterwards, but all I felt was relief.  My husband was wonderful and my kids are handling everything well.  I have to go back on the 20th for a post op check and to see an oncologist.  I'm hoping they will wait til after Christmas for chemo.  I can't imagine them starting it that soon after surgery.

Hope everyone has a Merry Christmas!!!

							Welcome home Shelly !  I had to take sleeping pills for a couple of weeks, and then stopped so I wouldn't get dependent on them. You need your rest during the night so see what your doctor suggests.  I am not a big pill taker, but since I got bc I have had to take a fews things to help me through the journey. I am so glad you don't have much pain. The surgery has now done 75% of the work by removing the tumor and lymph glands. I hope they wait on chemo until after Christmas too.  I can't imagine that a few days will make that much difference and it seems like you will need to heal and get your strength back. Before you fall asleep at night do deep breathing a mediate for about 5 minutes. This helps me relax and my sleep is much better.  Love, Hollis

							Hi Shelly,

Glad to hear you are feeling so well after surgery. Good for you. As far as when chemo begins I can only tell you of my experience, I had bilateral MRM on Oct 20, 2004, had surgical port inserted Nov. 18th, (that area is still sore when I move certain ways), and started chemo on Monday Nov. 22. I have chemo every other Monday. So, for me, chemo started about 1 month post op. Not sure what kind of surgery you had but mine was pretty extensive so I needed the 4 weeks to recoup, actually would have preferred more time between the surgery and the port insertion as that area was and still is very bruised. I can't imagine that you would start chemo before January.  
I hope this was helpful,

							Hi, Shelley, glad the surgery is over and you are not in a lot of discomfort. I agree with Hollis. If you need a little something to help you sleep for a few days, take it. You might try propping pillows around yourself in bed to get comfortable. Or, use that recliner. My DH has allegies that bother him in the fall, and occasionally sacks out in our reclinder because the sinus drainage does not bother him as much. The bottom line is do what you have to do to be comfortable while you mend. Have a good week. Gentle hugs, Lauri

							Hi Shelley:  I had the same problem as you.  Like to sleep on my side and wasn't able to do that easily.  I found that if I laid on my other side and hugged a pillow so that it was between my arm and breast, it cushioned the breast and lymph node incisions.  On occasion I also took 1/2 pain killer just to take the edge off.  You need to do what you have to do to get rest.  It will make all the difference in your recovery.  I've just completed my 2nd chemo treatment of A/C with virtually no nausea and only headache -- felt like pre-flu symptoms.  Able to go back to work after two days.  If not for the hair loss, would really not know too much difference.  But I believe the key is at least 8 hours good rest each night to let your body start to heal. so do what you need to do to relax.

SCC of the tongue may have some relation to HPV infection. But this virus is so widespread thato one can not assume that it was transmitted through oral sex, although it probably can happen. It does not mean that you have a serious disease, but you may carry the virus as well. Regardless of this problem, you should be getting Pap smears, and there they can see if you have cellular changes consistent with HPV infection. Your children do not need to be checked. HPV may be linked to several different cancers, but that does not mean that it will cause it. It is like the sun, it is a risk factor for skin cancer, but not all that sun bathe will get skin cancer. It is only a risk factor.

Jenny, I have been fighting Squamous Cell cancer since 1998. It is not caused from a ""Virus"". It is a cancer of its own. It is a flat cell cancer and is usually found in a surface area, such as the lungs, inside of the mout or throat. Mine had an""Unknown Primary"", they don;t know where it came from. It does not spread  through kissing, sex or contact. It will spread rapidly in your husband if he doesn't get treatments such as Chemo and Radiation. I wouldn't get Radiation at first and thought the surgeries would get it. They DIDN'T!! Itr matastisized to the tongue, other side of my throat, then the left lung . Following massive Radiation to my throat and surgery to my right lung, I was in remission for about a year. It came back in the lymphnodes between my lungs and a new tumor in my left lung! I just finished more Radiation and am still doing Chemo for another month. Diagnosis? I am tterminal and have maybe a year or two left.

							I have had surgery for calcification removal, then another because margin was not clear in one area. Dr. wants radiation but I live 45 mi. from facility and 6 wks of treatment in winter along with my RA would be impossible.  He has mentioned MammoSite and said he will think about it and call me, 5 days of 2 times a day seems better choice to me.  Has anyone had this situation and/or refused radiation or tamoxifen?

							Hi Hoosier - I live in an isolated Fort on the water in Cornwall, and it takes almost 2 hours each way to get to the hospital where I am being treated - by car, ferry then car. When I was told I needed chemo I didn't think I would be able to do this journey but then I realised I would do anything to prevent a recurrence - I had invasive ductal carcinoma which had already spread. Chemo was only every 3 weeks and my elderly, disabled husband thankfully took me to every session and sat next to me whilst having the infusion.
However, the thought of 5 and a half weeks of Mon-Fri radiotherapy treatments filled me with horror - I just couldn't see myself doing that awful journey and my husband was not up to all that driving.I broke down one chemo session and my breast care nurse said she would arrange volunteer transport for the rx. I had male drivers, who came right to the Fort, we picked up dialysis patientson the way to the hospital, had 3 mins treatment then had to wait  up to an hour for the driver to come back and pick me up, and others, who were in a worse state than myself. It made me feel very humble.   Some days it took 6 hours door to door - I took a book, a drink and some dry discuits. 
I am so glad now that I did it and gave myself every chance I could.
Most of the drivers had lost their wives to breast cancer, and this was their way of putting something back into our socialised health care system.It is a very individual choice whether to go with rx or not, and you have every right to refuse it. Could you perhaps ask the treatment centre if they have volunteer drivers in your area? I didn't know they were available here until my nurse told me. 
I wish you well in the forthcoming months - the rx treament is a doddle compared with chemo, but it does make you very tired.
Take care, love, Liz.

							HI,
Like Liz, I would do everything possible to prevent a reoccurence.  I had to drive one hour each way for treatment.  Of course the driving everyday gets old, but having a reoccurence would be by far the worst thing.  No matter what it took, I'd have those treatments.
Best of luck

							Hi,

I would strongly recommend doing some kind of radiation.  It really does decrease the possibility of a local recurrence.  This is especially important because the margin was not clean.

Sometimes the hospitals have a program whereby they help with transportation - a bus or van to help rural people get to their appointments.  Also, I think the American Cancer Society has volunteer drivers to help people get to their appointments.  It wouldn't hurt to ask.

Good luck,

							It is in her brain now. the pain drugs are keeping her out of it. 
She went on a ventilator on tuesday last week. they are going to use a laser to destroy some of the tumor that is interfering with her breathing, blocking the airway. 50/50 chance to work. If it doesn't they are going to take her off the respirator and keep her comfortable as possible until she passes. this is supposed to happen today, but i have not heard any news.
they were supposed to take her off the ventilator last Friday, but my dad could not do it. Wanted to give her another chancce. They said that they were going to do the radiation on her to shrink the tumor that is pressing into her spine so that she would have less pain and need less pain meds, and thus be more lucid, but instead they found that it is blocking her airway and are going to try this.

							Hi everyone. I was wondering if anyone had been diagnosed with cording in the breast, a year after radiotherapy? I had a 2cm invasive ductal cancer, 2 surgeries early 2003, then 6 x FEC and 45 rads, finishing treatment Nov 03. About 3 months ago I felt a long lump in the upper part of the breast which had the tumour - the tumour was below the nipple. I went to my GP and he felt it and sent me for an urgent referral to the breast care centre where I was treated. I was seen on a Sat morning, so guess it was urgent. Unfortunately the duty breast surgeon was not the one who treated me, but he was kind and communicative.
He sent me off right away for an ultrasound (no mammo) and the radiologist advised there was no tumour, and the lump was due to radiotherapy. 
I don't even remember the surgeon telling us this, I only remember his saying that I can never expect my breast to feel the same, after chemo and rx. My husband remembered about the cording, and says I should forget about the lump, as I had very good advice from the surgeon.
I have never heard of this - cording in the arm due to axilliary removal yes, but not in the breast itself.
I feel such a hypochondriac and daren't go back to my GP - but the lump is still there. It wasn't there until 3 months ago and I am concerned it is a recurrence. I was grade 2, stage 2, with 3/18 nodes positive. I am not scheduled to see my own breast surgeon for an annual mammo until March 2005 and the worry of this current lump is making me sick with worry - I can't eat and am losing a lot of weight.
Dr. Leo - have you heard of this cording due to rx? I would appreciate any advice from anyone to put my mind at rest.
Many thanks, Liz in England.

							Hello

I don't think I understand what you mean by ""cording"". Would you please elaborate on this ?

thanks
Leo
						

"
"


							Hi Dr. Leo - thank you for responding so quickly. I can only guess what the surgeon meant i.e. the same type of cording one gets in the arm after axillary node removal. The lump feels like a long cord or piece of very thick string.
I've never seen this side effect of rx especially some 9 months after finishing treatment and that is why I am concerned.
Liz.
						

"
"


							On another forum I saw posts about cording in the breasts, which was mostly discussed as something felt to be ""ropy"" in the breast and was due to rads treatment for bc. I don't think it is very common. The woman who posted about it was being treated with a medication for it and she wasn't sure whether the medication was helping or not. 

I have rads damage in the breast too, called ""fatty necrosis"", but it is a very hard piece of tissue where the fat in the breast was burned and melted into a hard shape. It is painful to any pressure so I no longer can sleep on my front side at all, and it isn't very pleasnt. It isn't all that common either. I have taken a very low dose of amitriptyline for it at times, but that along with the loss of estrogen from chemo treatment was too drying to the eyes, so I only take the amitriptyline when the pain is pretty awful. 

Best wishes to you. I wish there was more awareness of how damaging treatment can be for us, so that docs have more genuine perspective about recommending it to some of us for whom the benefit is so marginal.

AlaskaAngel

I suspect both of these are just uncommon enough that they are not usually mentioned as possible side effects from radiation -- whether or not we have a ""right to know"" so that we can make better decisions  about whether to have treatment.

							Dr. Leo and Alaska Angel - thank you sincerely for your responses to my post. I had a consultation with my gastro yesterday about my Crohn's and brought up the subject of cording in my breast as he had worked for some time in radiology. He seconded the surgeon's opinion and Dr. Leo's that changes due to rx can occur many months after finishing treatment and I should ""just keep an eye on the lump"" - with a slide rule? I must say I feel a lot happier now I know this is a side effect of the treatment. Thank you again. Liz.
						

"
"


							You're welcome, Liz. By the way, I eventually did make it a point to go back and see the rads doc I had for rads treatment, even though I had to travel back to California to do it. I think that rads docs do not generally see these problems because it takes so long for them to surface. I wanted the rads doc to have more information about what happens with some of the patients she has treated. I like her quite a bit as she has always been very conscientious with me. She examined the breast and we decided to do an MRI for the area in question. The MRI did not indicate cancer. I then saw my surgeon, who had told me previously that he believed it was probably fatty necrosis. He then reviewed the MRI as well. He eventually did a needle aspiration, which I appreciated because it did relieve some of the pressure/pain that had been building up, and that pain has never been quite as bad since then. 

So... in summary... I think the docs are not as informed about these things as they would be if in the normal course of events they did get to see us again, which they generally don't, so they just truly don't actually know what the outcome is. 

But now my rads doc does know.

							Alaska Angel - thank you sincerely for sharing your experience with cording due to rx - I cannot begin to tell you how much your insight has meant to me. I didn't even had a radiation oncologist - we have socialised medicine in England and it is a little different to the Us protocols. I did have good care, but not a rx doctor I could talk to. Once I finished chemo I was  sent to radiotherapy and just saw technicians and nurses. I think I had one consulation with the chemo oncologist after chemo and during rx, so it is all a bit of a blur. Not exactly awe inspiring is it?
Thank you so much for your caring and sharing.

							Usually rectal cancer is treated with surgery, radiation and chemotherapy. A combination of these treatments is usually necessary. The goal is to get all the tumor out. Some advocate receiving chemotherapy before surgery, and even radiation to reduce the tumor and facilitate surgery.

It is impossible to know exactly what it is. It sounds your doctor wants to recheck things in 6 months to see how (if) it changes. I can only speculate as to what the nodules are, and if you are unsure about this you can always seek a second opinion.

Recommendation by Urologist is external beam radiation after CT scan for ""planning purposes""

****This is ""salvage radiotherapy.""

Questions:
    Is this CT scan a staging tool or just for purposes of aiming the radiation?
****If the EBRT is intensity modulated radiotherapy (IMRT), a CT scan is part of the preliminaries. It is used to plan where to aim the radiation and in what dosage (expressed in ""grays"" [Gy]). IMRT, which I finished in October, is the latest and most accurate mode of EBRT. Its accuracy permits employment of higher doses of radiation than previously possible because it reduces the risk of damaging tissues one does not wish to damage. In short, it focusses the radiation where it is most needed.

See Prostate Cancer Research Institute, http://prostate-cancer.org/index.html

And read Stephen Strum's excellent _A Primer on Prostate Cancer_. Dr. Strum is a medical oncologist.

    Would a high resolution MRI be prudent to accurately stage and locate any nodes which appear to be cancerous?  (i.e. identify any metastasis)
****Subject to correction, I do not believe that an MRI is capable of locating metastases.

     Should a medical oncologist be involved in addition to radiation oncologist?
****Depends on the capability of the rad onc. Med oncs generally enter the picture after other treatments fail, and they handle chemotherapy. 

However, the timing of this message couldn't be better. I consulted a med onc just yesterday, 12/17/04, because I'm concerned about my rad onc's ability outside his specialty.

Good thing I did. Discovered that, as I suspected, he had made two critical errors with regard to my medical (as opposed to radiation) treatment. That's now being addressed.

The reason I suspected errors is that I studied, learned, and took charge of my case. Strum's book, though not my only source, is the essential foundation.

      Would clinical trials be suggested at this juncture?
****I am not a medic. ""Visitor"" should consult with his own medical advisor about this. Having said that, I'll say further that there's nothing in his post that leads me to think that ""Visitor"" has reached that point. Clinical trials, AIUI, are usually populated by folks who have run out of options, and that does not appear to be ""Visitor's"" case.

							Hello Visitor

Thanks for posting. You certainly have lots of difficult questions.

#1 The CT can be used for both. I am not sure what your doctor is using it for, but the term ""planning"" can be used for radiation therapy, i.e. where they are going to use the radiation.

#2 I don't think MRI would be much of help, but it can be used. A CT is the primary tool for doing this, and the MRI may be used next

#3 As a future medical oncologist, I think that a medical oncologist should be involved early when you are contemplating other options. The oncologist will review what you've been through, and coordinate with a surgeon and radiation oncologist if necessary. Then he will offer you the treatment choices that are available, and help you make a decision.

#4 Clinical trials can be done at any point. As someone mentioned above, trials are most commonly done with people that failed everything else and have run out of options. But maybe there is a trial that offers you the standard treatment PLUS another type of treatment or placebo, and that may be interesting. You can always ask about that.

I have been alittle sluggish but I didn't think I needed a shot!
My Hgb and PLT  HCT are low this makes me very worried that something elese is gonna happen now..

It's hard to have the usually happy holiday prep remind us of the all the anxiety and dismay we were suffering at this time last year!

I was treated for Invasive Ductal.  Who gets blood work and who doesn't?  I'm just curious if I'm the only one that never gets its?  I see my radiation oncologist January 12.  Should I ""insist"" on it?  I don't see my medical oncologist until next August.  Also, I've been on Tamoxifen for a year.  Should blood be checked for that, too?

							Hi all,
I always wondered this myself.  I was one year from chemo on 9/24/03 and completed rads 12/30/03.  I have never had any blood test at all.  The last one I had was after my last chemo because I was going away and the doc wanted to make sure my numbers were good ( I had to continue taking the nuprogen even though I was done chemo)...Other than that at my oncol visit every 3  months they do nothing.
Although I go to they GYN every six months because of the tamoxifen and she ran a blood test to see if I was anemic because I had been feeling tired.  But that came out OK!

							Kristen ~ Thanks for responding.  

I had the chemo every 3 weeks and didn't have my blood checked about 10 days after the treatment.  Everyone in my support group who had the chemo every 3 weeks had their blood checked then to see if they needed a ""booster"" so their counts would be up and they would not have their chemo off-schedule.  As a result, I was not able to take my last chemo on schedule.  I don't understand the disparity in treatments and follow-ups.  Anytime I voice my concerns to this doctor he just blows me off.  I am so confused as to what is ""normal"" for bloodwork and follow-up.

							I live far from my onc so haven't had hardly any contact with him after completing chemo and rads, but right after rads was done I did have an appointment with him and a CBC was automatically done with that appointment.

The docs I know here in my home town see bc patients the first 2 years every 3 or 4 months and a CBC is always done with those appointments. The docs differ more in terms of having marker blood draws, some do and some don't (but the ones with the most experience and training do).  After the first 2 years post-treatment, the docs here see bc patients every 6 months for the next 3 years.

I am 2 years out from chemo and rads, and my blood counts are still just below normal. I have re-read every book and pamphlet I had at time of diagnosis and none of them provide any warning that this is going to be normal after chemo or rads. I do feel that not being told this could happen is just as bad as lying about it, since the blood cell counts are major parts of our immune systems and the immune system is pretty important for those who do end up dealing with recurrence.

My focus in dealing with the low counts has been 3-fold. I try to have a tiny piece of liver twice a week to provide more iron (and more alpha-lipoic acid). I try to get whatever direct sunshine I can for 15-40 minutes a day (which is not often in Alaska in winter but I do the best I can, as I think bone health promotes blood health). And I try to get 20 minutes a day of some aerobic exercise.

My blood counts improved somewhat at the end of 3 months of concentrated effort to do those things. However, recently they have been dropping again, perhaps due to the onset of winter or perhaps due to something related to the mysterious rise in liver enzymes.

If I were you I would ask for a CBC and liver enzymes to be done at least yearly if not every 6 months. Mine are done quarterly and I am NED, Stage 1, HER2+++.

							I'm really surprised that your oncos aren't doing bloodwork everytime you see them.  Once I was done with treatment, I saw my onco every 3 months for a check up which included CBC w/diff and CMP (Complete Metobolic Profile).  After a year and I was still NED, he still did those 2 along with the CA27-29.  I will go on Valentine's Day next year, which will be 3 years to the day that I was dx. and I'll have them all done again.  I'll go to every 6 months (if my anxiety level can handle it) and still will have labs done.  Ya'll are the 1st ones that I've heard of that didn't have labs during each check up.
During chemo, I had it done 2 weeks after my FEC and then of course the next week, which was my chemo week.  My 1st treatment he did every week to see how my system responded to chemo as far as my levels rebounding on their own.  Since they did and I didn't have to get the shot for red or white counts, then it was 2 weeks after and the day of chemo.
I really can't think of a logical reason that you aren't getting labs done.  They show the liver enzimes, kidneys, calcium and so many things that they need to know as far as reocurrences go, along with you telling them how you're feeling.
I'd ask WHY when I saw them again.

							AA, Lauri and Nancy ~ Thank you all for taking the time to respond.

The last time I saw my medical oncologist was the first week of August and I was 6 months out of rads.  He told me to come back in a year.  Does that sound right?????  I realize I have a good prognosis (node-negative and HER2neu- and ER PR+).  I have some really good prognostic factors.  BUT sometimes he acts like I just got over the flu or a bad hang nail.  I asked him about bloodwork  in August and  he said ""Why, if you're feeling really good?""

Anyway, I do see the radiation oncologist on January 12.  This is the first time I am seeing this doctor as the one I saw during radiation has just retired.  He is young and out of Harvard and Yale so I'm hoping he is more up-to-date on everything.  I have a list of questions and intend on having a nice long discussion with him.  I'm hoping I can arrange it so that I can just bypass the medical oncologist and see him instead.  

Did I mention that at my six-month follow-up the medical oncologist did not even check the lymph nodes under the arm or on the neck?  Doesn't that sound strange?

I live in rural Maine and there is a shortage of doctors and dentists.  He is the only oncologist in town.  

Anyway, I'll let everyone know how it goes on the 12th.  Again, thanks.

							I'd check on going out of town to another oncologist.  At the time I was dx, I lived in a small city and drove an hour each way (or had someone drive me) not only for the surgeries but also chemo and rads.
I realize I was Stage III and that along with my age but me high risk for a reoccurence, but I was er/pr+, her2- and had all the bone scans, CT scans, etc. before I started treatment so they knew it hadn't gone past the nodes.  Everyone I know, even stage I goes every 3 months in the beginning and for 2 years, then they go to every 6 months for 3 years and then yearly.
Not to scare you and by what you are saying, your chances are good of not having a reoccurence, but I've known stage I with no node involvement, tiny tumors and had a mastectomy and chemo, just to better their odds and have had reoccurences.
Seriously look for an onco outside your city.  If he's blowing you off like you had a cold, that can't be comforting for you at all and God knows this isn't a cold and until there is a cure, no one is guarenteed not to have a reoccurence.  You deserve the best care possible and you're not getting it. You have to be your own advocate and demand good care. It's your life and if yours doesn't seem to care about it, you do and we do!!!!!!!
I lost a very close friend this month and her care compared to mine, sucked.  She was stage III like me, but things they did and didn't do, compared to my care and treatment, they never gave her a fighting chance.

Even though my treatments are over (with the exception of hormonal), I still feel the need to visit and post on BC boards because there are still a lot of physical and emotional issues to deal with.  I prefer this over a ""real life"" support group.

If you are bored and want to know more about me, LOL go over to the Lounge and read the thread entitled ""Hobbies.""    

Wishing everyone health and happiness

							Hi Everybody,
My Name is Kristen and I live in Central Mass.  I am 43 and was dx April 2003 on Good Friday.  I had lumpectomy with re-incision and sental node with reported negative nodes, only to find a week later one positive node.  So back in for the THIRD time, the rest of the nodes were negative.  I was dx with invasive ductal carcinoma with 1.6 cm, ER/PR + HER2 strongly positive.  I had 8 rounds of chemo 4 A/C, 4 taxol dose dense with daily nuprogen shots and 38 rounds of rads, 5 years tamoxifen. Treatment ended Dec 30, 2003 but I still carry a lot of the emotional stuff.  
So, as you all can see I have almost hit the one year mark for the ending of treatment.  But, like someone else here stated, I feel the need to be in constant contact here and elsewhere on the board because it has been a very emotional year.  
I have two wonderful twin girls who just turned 10, and a very supportive husband.
It's great to meet you all, and I would like to say a special thanks to Leo for all his hard work in responding to all our postings. I think its great having a place to go to ask questions to a doctor. 
I look foward to cooresponding with you all, and I hope you all have a great holiday!

							Hi again,
I just wanted to reassure you ladies that are hitting the one year mark of either your dx or the end of treatment, that things do get easier and you will find you don't live and breath cancer the longer you are NED.  There's never a day go by I don't think of it, how can we ever forget, but it's more of a passing thought most times.  I do get nervous before my check ups, which is something I think we will do for quite sometime.  I promise, it will get easier and this is coming from a Stage III ILC lady.  It will be 3 years for me Valentine's Day that I was dx.  I can't tell you honestly how I'll feel with it being on the exact day, just 3 years later but I don't get myself worked up weeks before my check up, it's down to days now.  We'll always have that black cloud hanging over our head, so we just have to keep fighting for a cure.  I'm a big Nascar fan and one of the drivers has a ""Race fans for a Cure"" website where pins, t-shirts etc. are sold and it tells exactly how much goes to the Susan G. Komen Foundation.  In Oct. one of the drivers drove a pink and white car and not only did his sponsor donate to the Breast Cancer Research Foundation, but the driver did as well.  There are alot of big companies that are donating and fighting for us, we just have to jump up and down and get more people to realize that when 1 out of 7 ladies will be dx with BC in their lifetime, someone in their family if not themselves will be dx and they need to start putting the big $$$$$ into research.  I have no plans of going anywhere anytime soon   If anyone needs to talk and would feel better doing it privately, please feel free to e-mail me anytime.
Some will find that moving on and staying off support boards is the right thing for them and others will stay on the support boards, which is right for them.  We all handle things differently, but the emotional roller coaster from hell when it comes to being diagnosed and going through treatment and the fears for the 1st year or so are the same.  Only we can understand how it feels.  Never feel like something you feel is ""abnormal"" or strange because I can assure you everyone of us has had the same feeling and wondered the same thing.
May 2005 be a year of happiness and HEALTH for all of us

							I'll go next.  My name is Marion and live in St. Joseph, Missouri.  Six years ago had 3 cysts removed from left breast but were benign.  In 10/04 diagnosed with breast cancer Stage IIA with a 1.6 cm tumor that appeared from behind the scar tissue in the exact same spot. (I'm told that is becoming more and more common.)  Consequently mammograms were not able to find the tumor behind the scar tissue and only found through my own examination.  Axillary dissection of 14 nodes but only 1 positive.  Currently in 3rd of 4 A/C treatments, then will follow with 6 weeks radiation, 4 treatments taxotere, and 5 years Tamoxifen.  Treatment of A/C has gone extremely well (except for hair loss -- such a traumatic thing).  Developed hematoma at surgery site that I'm still dealing with.  Have a daughter in pharmacy school, very supportive husband also a pharmacist, nephew in medical school, 2 other nephews in pharmacy school and niece who is a nurse -- we could start our own med clinic        We women have all been forced to join an exclusive club.  Our best defense is education for ourselves and to understand what our medical teams are doing.  Thanks to Dr. Leo for helping us deal with all our emotional and medical questions.  I don't think any of us can properly explain how beneficial you are to our lives.

							OK...My name is Shelly and I live on the Florida panhandle.  I am 40 years old and have a wonderful husband and 3 children (Katie is 18, Ryan is 16 and Jessica is 11)

I was diagnosed on November 1 2004 from a biopsy of a lymph node under my arm.  They were unable to pinpoint anything else to biopsy so as of now, I don't know exactly which type of breast cancer that I have.  I do know that it is estrogen and progesterone receptor positive.  I had surgery on December 9th...MRM on the right and simple mastectomy on the left.  The MRM on the right was what the surgeon recommended and the simple on the left was my choice.  I'm doing well...just wish I could get a good night's sleep.  I go back for the post op follow up on Monday the 20th so hopefully I'll know more then. 

I will update as soon as I know something else.

							My name is Jan. I live in Largo, Florida and was just diagnosed this September, while sitting in the dark from hurricane Frances, with stage 3C invasive lobular cancer in both breasts. I'm told it is considered 2 seperate primary cancers. I had bilateral MRM's 10/20/04 and turned 45 a few days later. I had a port put in 11/18/04 and started chemo on 11/22/04. I am on dose dense chemo and will start my 3rd round of AC this Monday. I still have most of my hair but it was breaking off so much that yesterday I asked my husband to give me a buzz cut. I will have 4 rounds of taxol after my last AC tx then 33 rounds of radiation. The medical doctors I have been in contact with have expressed concern that I will be alive in 5 years, because of the extensive nodal involvement. For now though, I just stay on course and try not to get too anxious with every new pain I feel. I was just finishing up my last semester in prepharm courses and hoping to start pharmacy school in the fall, a 4 year program. If I really only have a few years to live, I don't want to spend them with my nose in a book even tough I try to face each day with the belief that I can overcome the odds and live a long full life. I have a wonderful and supportive husband.  Well, I think I've rambled on enough...Jan

							Hi Everyone,

I am new to this forum, and am seeking others who have experience with Taxol when used as a single agent.

My husband was given his first dose of this a week ago today....his only side effect so far has been debilitating muscle aches and joint pains.  This started Saturday night and has only begun to subside today.  He has been taking Oxycodone, sometimes along with Tylenol Arthritis, as well as Celebrex.  This regimen only dulled the pain, never fully relieving it.
I spoke with the clinic pharmacist today regarding this, and she will be working with the oncologist to devise a med plan that will make him more comfortable when he takes the next dose in a couple of weeks.  If anyone has any experience with this, I would like to know how you coped with the pain.

A bit of background on him: He was diagnosed with thymic carcinoma in April of '96.  It recurred in '01, was stabilized; then recurred again in June of this year.  Over the years, he has had single agent Cisplatin, 6 doses; Carboplatin, 2 doses in '01, followed by 4 doses of a ""cocktail"" consisting of Cisplatin, Adriamycin, and Cytoxan, which stabilized the tumors again; this past August, 3 doses of Carboplatin (did not respond), followed by 2 doses of the ""cocktail"" again (now stabilized); our oncologists are following up with the single agent Taxol in hopes of shrinking some of the tumors again.  (The thymoma was already metastatic when it was first diagnosed, but all visible cancerous  growths were surgically removed in '96.)  He has also had bladder cancer since 1991, but it has been in complete remission for over 2 years.

Any ideas or help concerning the Taxol would be appreciated.  We must be careful with most NSAIDS, as he is also recovering from massive PEs, including a saddle PE, and must limit his meds because of the Coumadin therapy.

Thanks for your input.

							Tonky,

Thanks for posting. All these side-effects from Taxol can be terrible, and the pain certainly can be a big issue. I am glad you/he will speak to the oncologist and adjust the analgesic treatment. Oxycodone is a good drug, but if it does not cut the pain there are alternatives to improve that.

best regards,

							Neuropathy, a problem that sometimes occurs with chemotherapy treatment. It's not all that rare, especially frequent in patients older than 65 years of age. It is damage to the nerves. It can occur from some chemotherapy drugs used in conventional cancer treatment.

There are three major goups of nerves in the human body, the peripheral nerves that carry information to and from the limbs, the nerves that supply the bowels and other internal organs, and the nerves of the head which connect to the ears, eyes, taste buds, etc. Nerves in any or all of these major groups can be affected by certain chemotherapy drugs.

Nerves are vulnerable to many kinds of damage. They can be damaged by certain cancers. This may be caused by the cancer cells producing a particular kind of biological agent that interferes with the function of the nerves. Sometimes, they can be damged by drugs used in chemotherapy treatment. The chemotherapy drugs that most likely cause nerve damage are the vinca alkaloids(vincristine, vindesine and vinblastine), platinum drugs(cisplatinum, carboplatinum) and the taxanes(taxol, taxotere). These drugs have the potential of interfering with nerve function.

You may notice symptoms in different areas of your body depending on which groups of nerves are affected. Symptoms in the hands and feet happen when peripheral nerve damage happens and are not rare with vinca alkaloids. The first sign of nerve damage is usually a feeling of tingling and numbness like what you experience when your foot goes to sleep after you've been sitting for a long time in an uncomfortable position. If the problem progresses further, it often produces weakness of the muscles, resulting in loss of strength at the wrist or the ankle. You will notice difficulty in doing up buttons and picking up coins. You may notice that you will tend to trip while walking up stairs or dragging your feet and tend to have a wide-based gait. In severe cases, the weakness may be so severe that you will need a wheelchair.

When the nerves in the bowel are affected, constipation is the earliest sign. In a few people, the abdomen becomes bloated with a distended bowel that is basically paralyzed. Some of the nerves in the head can also be affected. Platinum drugs can affect the auditory nerve and cause loss of hearing and tinnitus(ringing in the ears). Vision can very occasionally be affected.

A lot depends on how quickly your cancer treatment can be stopped. Sometimes the need for treatment is more urgent then the residual nerve damage. Sometimes, the balance between benefit from the drug and the side effect of nerve damage is more finely balanced.

Once treatment has been stopped, recovery is usually slow. It may take months to get even partial improvement and often there will be some residual impairment, either a motor weakness or a sensory numbness or both. Recovery is slower in the feet and legs than in the hands and arms.

There is no specific treatment that enhances nerve recovery. There are no drugs that will directly stimulate nerve regeneration or recovery. If you have severe and prolonged pain, then the pain may require narcotics often combined with antidepressants. In some cases, certain types of anticonvulsants would be helpful. Treatment options are subjects that you should discuss with your doctor, so you have accurate expectations of potential benefits and side effects.

Chemotherapy drugs that can cause neuropathy. NCI lists these as most likely to do so:

Cisplatinum (Platinol)
Carboplatin (Paraplatin)
Vincristine (Oncovin)
Vinblastine (Velban)
Etoposide/VP-16 (VePesid)
Cytarabine (Cytosar, Ara-C)
Hexamethylmelamine (Hexalen)
Suramin
Paclitaxel (Taxol) and Docetaxel (Taxotere)
Other medications reported to contribute to neuropathy include oxaliplatin (Eloxatin), gemcitibine (Gemzar) and thalidomide (Thalomid).

							GDP,

Thank you so much for your reply.  I went to your website and read the sad account of your late wife's battle with OV Cancer.  Of course, it reinforces my  reservations about all of the chemo that my husband is having.  We are lucky that our oncologists do involve us completely in the decisions concerning the drugs, and are careful to point out that chemo can oftentimes be as damaging as the cancer itself.  They reassess his condition after every chemo dose.  So far, we have been fortunate that there seems to be no permanent damage to his body.

As to my question about Taxol and pain, he has not experienced any neuropathy at all..just transient muscle and joint aches, for about 4 days.  After they stop, they are completely gone until another dose.  Since he is allergic to morphine, and taking a synthetic drug like hydromorphone could be risky, we are relying on the condone drugs, which do a less than perfect job of giving him relief.  If his upcoming PET/CT shows continuing stability or shrinkage, he will be given 3 more doses of Taxol, then will have a holiday, until another recurrence.  (Currently, there is no clinically proven single-action protocol for Thymic Carcinoma, since it is such a rare cancer....recurrences are almost a given with this disease.)

Your experiences with your wife's chemo ordeals lead me to question whether or not we are taking a big chance with all the Taxol.  In carefully studying your story, I came away with the idea that a lot of the things that happened were related to the fact that OV cancer was the disease.  In your opinion, is there an across- the -board tendency for Taxol to cause the same problems that your wife had, regardless of the type of cancer?  I would appreciate your ideas about this.

I enjoy reading when a new drug or procedure comes out, and the people writing the report or article then badmouth the previous drug or procedure in explaining it. It is usually possible to get very interesting information on company's products from various company websites. They are competitors of course.

Taxol is given into a vein, but in order for the body to absorb the drug, it must first be dissolved in a solution. Taxol's history began fourty-three years ago. It was found to be virtually insoluble in water. It had the solubility of a brick. The compound wouldn't dissolve very much in any solution. Without a way to get it into a cancer patient, what good was it? It was discovered that something Taxol would dissove in that ""might"" work in a reasonably ""safe"" intravenous solution in humans. It was an elixir made of castor oil and marketed as Cremophor EL. It was the ""only"" answer (until synthetic compounds were introduced like Taxotere). However, this castor-oil carrier is suspected as the culprit behind the misery which includes nausea, vomiting, joint pain, appetite loss, brittle hair and tingling sensations in hands and feet (neuropathy). The much ballyhooed drug was no panacea.

The American Cancer Society, in its press release about a new breast cancer drug approved, mentioned that the solution can cause dangerous allergic reactions in many people, so patients ""must"" first take other drugs like steroids and antihistamines in ""hopes"" to prevent a bad reaction. The solution can also leach chemicals from regular plastic tubes used to deliver medication, so Taxol must be given through special tubing.

The new drug for breast cancer (Abraxane) is a new form of Taxol (Paclitaxel), which is also a widely used breast cancer drug. So, no, Taxol side effects can happen in any cancer, not just ovarian. Abraxane does not need to be dissolved in the castor oil solution and does not require special equipment to be given to patients. However, more of the women on Abraxane had numbness and tingling in their hands and feet. And more suffered nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, muscle and joint pain and anemia.

The percentage of patients that must respond to a drug before it is approved by the FDA varies as high as 80% to as low as 20%. Thereafter, it is used routinely for all patients with the same form of cancer, though unfortunately, a drug that helps one person does not necessarily mean it will help all patients with the same diagnosis. Taxol was approved by the FDA with a 30% efficacy (not accuracy).

Now, Bionumerik, in boosting its new drug Tavocept, that is aimed at preventing or reducing common and serious side effects, particularly nerve and kidney damage, associated with taxane (Taxol) and platinum (Carboplatin) drugs, talks about in their literature that chemotherapy-induced toxicities are common and serious clinical problems that adversely impact both the quality of life of cancer patients and the ability of patients to continue treatment for their cancer. Very little has been accomplished to prevent or reduce chemotherapy-induced toxicities such as nerve damage (neurotoxicity), kidney damage (nephrotoxicity) and hearing impairment (ototoxicity). But now they have another new product.

Thanks for your reply.  My husband will have a PET/CT in a couple of weeks, and my question may be a moot point, if the Taxol is not being effective.  (They will discontinue if the cancer has regressed.)

I do have a lot of faith in our oncologists....they work in a cancer clinic in a good teaching hospital, the Medical College of Georgia, to be precise.  They are also getting input from the leading thymic carcinoma doctor, who is at Indiana Medical College.  He sees several thymic patients a month, whereas most oncologists do not see a case in their lifetime.  He suggested that Taxol be given instead of additional Cisplatin, Adriamycin, and Cytoxan cocktail.  I know that our doctors are well aware of the many undesired side effects of all chemos, and are very pleased with how well my husband recuperates after each series, also the fact that he has always gotten several years' stability and well-being each time he undergoes treatment.  It is a bit scary this time, though....when he finishes this series, he will have taken 11 doses total, using 5 different chemos.  He has bounced back remarkably after each dose, though, and 2 of the 3 weeks beween dose, he usually feels quite good.  A lot of Taxol is being given in our clinic, too, for many different cancers.....it will be a shame of many of these patients go on to develop further illness as a result of the drugs.

Thank your for your interest.  The nurses had mentioned that Taxol was given in an oil, but did not specify what kind 9Neither did I ask!)

Jane (Tonkyii)

							Gee. I hope the cancer hasn't regressed. And I hope that they would not discontinue if it has. Has any tumor or fluid specimens been retained at pathology? Take a look at postings for chemosensitivity testing at either the breast or ovarian cancer subjects on this web site. This technology excels in refractory cancer.

It's interesting that your doctors at Medical College of Georgia are getting input from a leading thymic carcinoma doctor at Indiana Medical College. I am certainly happy for that. It IS usual. Your in good hands. It reminds me of a form of what once was a very rare form of cancer (Leptomingeal Carcinomatous or Carcinomatous Meningitis). For ovarian cancer, up until 1994, there was only 14 well documented cases on record. What was so unusual is that about 50% of this type of cancer was diagnosed ""post-mortum."" Only after the patient died had they discovered it.

There are two ways to get this cancer, and my wife (unfortunately by bad oncologists at our local community hospital) got it from one of those ways (direct extension from a spinal tumor left unevaluated). My oldest brother was an associate clinical professor at Penn State Hershey Medical School and I used his connections to have my wife operated for a brain met in 1998. Because of the unevaluated spinal lesion at our local community (so-called community cancer center) hospital, I took her back up there to conclusively find out what was happening and how to get some additional life for my wife.

Like that Indiana Medical College doctor, Penn State Hershey Medical Hospital is a leading institution on lymphomas. And because of their knowledge of advanced lymphomas (carcinomatous meningitis from lymphomas) they were instrumental in helping my wife's carcinomatous meningitis from ovarian. I posted what information I saved from that experience on ""other cancers"" subjects on this site.

That ""oil"" is something that my mother remembers that doctors gave patients, way, way back then.
						

"
"


							Yep, Castor oil was a renowned treatment for many children in my childhood....some parents gave periodic doses of it to their offspring, just to give them a good ""cleaning out"".  Fortunately, my mother was not one of them..her remedy was ""Castoria"", which was more than likely a small amount of the oil camouflaged with sweet syrup.  I was given a dose of the genuine article as a prep-step to inducing labor with my first child...ugh!!

As to what our doctors will do if my husband's cancer isn't behaving..they have told us that there are several other drugs that have worked for some with Thymic carcinoma.....the oral drug Iressa has been used in clinical trial.....only about 20% of patients have positive response, but in that group, the response was good.  The Indiana doctor (Dr. Loehrer) is starting new trials soon for thymic carcinoma....I am not sure yet what the regimens will be, but my husband might not qualify because he has had continuing stability success with other agents for almost 9 years.

What concerned me most was the fact that when I read your wife's story, it seemed that the Taxol was directly responsible for her brain metatisis, but in your last post, some of the info leads me to believe that had she gotten proper treatment at every step, she might not have presented with the brain involvement.  Am I still misconstruing exactly what happened?

Thank you for all the research...I plan to carefully study a lot of info on this site.  Incidentally, my husband seems to be tolerating the treatment he had on 1/20 somewhat better than the last time.....we are using a combo of Oxycontin, 10 mg, Tylenol Arthritis, and Benadryl.  He has also resumed his minuim-dose Celebrex.  He had Oxycontin last year when he had knee replacements, and he has no problems with it for a short treatment period.

Again, thanks.

Boy! Your information about Castoria really poked the mind of my 90 year old mother (in a NH) when I told her about it. She does remember Castoria was a better tasting substance that came later because no one like the taste of Castor oil. It brought back memories of her mother, who had a mom & pop grocery store. Remember those? There was one on just about every corner of any city, and many people came to the store to buy Castor oil for whatever ailed them (probably, as you said, a prep-step to inducing labor when a lot of child birth was done at home). This was over a hundred years ago.

I had always thought that the postoperative whole brain radiation was the one and only thing that caused the demise of my wife. It still was the primary morbidity, however, from numerous response letters I received from scientists, I came to understand that her Taxol had a contributing factor. Leukoencephalopathy (basically brain damage) results from structural alterations of cerebral white matter, characterized by cerebral edema and can occur in patients of any age (but particularly more often in those over 65). Cranial irradiation and/or chemotherapy agents, especially those used in high-dose protocols, are causal agents. The prevalence of toxic leukoencephalopathy is unknown. Because this syndrome alters neurobehavioral function, patients may present in a confused state (I believe they call it chemobrain or chemofog). When my medical expert perused her medical records, he confirmed the pathology of her leukoencephalopathy.

The other part of Taxol, on my wife, was chemo-resistance. The effectiveness of taxane/platin combination is limited because of the late stages of a lot of cancer and most patients develop resistance. Most cancer patients have the drug bounce off their tumors, doing little if any good. Because of the ""dose-intense"" nature of the treatment, it also suppresses the immune system, making it possible new tumors to grow because the patient has been rendered unable to resist them (this would be more pronounced in those over 65). And the taxanes and platins do permeate (pass through) the blood brain barrier (the system that protects the brain from foreign substances by blocking their passage from the blood).

In my wife's case, in regards to ovarian cancer, a NCI observational study in 1995 reported experience in their clinic where recurrent systemic disease occurred in all ovarian patients for which they received dose-intense Paclitaxel (Taxol) therapy. Brain metastasis was the only site of disease recurrence. I've had numerous cancer patients or the loved ones of cancer patients who have written to me with their experience with brain mets after dose-intense taxol/carboplatin regimens. These patients had either ovarian, breast or lung cancers. Never had any from ""rare cancers."" Another scientist from a major lab had told me that platins can make a patient less resistant to radiation treatments, making the side-effects more pronounced.

I sincerely hope the Iressa helps out. I've read a lot of pros and cons about it, but one must research it for themselves. There is not a ""right"" or ""wrong decision"", just an ""informed"" decision.

							Hello,  This is my first posting to your forum on Taxol.  I would like to give you some information of myself.  I am 50, female, with stage IIA BC.  There are no lymph knodes involved, the margins are clear, and the infiltrated ductual carsinoma size was 3cm.  It was removed Dec. 1, 2004.  I started chemo on Jan. 10, 2005 with Cytoxin and Adromiacyn (sp) dose dense of every 14 days.  I am also Estrogen Receptor and Progesteron Receptor negitive and HER2NEU positive.  Premenapausal.  Altho now with chemo I was told I will be going through menapause.  My hot flashes back this up.   Now here is the new news.  My oncologist would like me to take Taxol or taxene's, he feels the HER2NEU positive is  a reason to do this even with all the GOOD things I have going on for myself.  This I believe will also be for dose dense 4 sessions. (My last session of A & C will be Feb. 21, 2005 with 14 days later starting the Taxol's)  I am truly having a struggle to decide if I even should take this next set of sessions. I have been told by other Taxol users that they needed liquid morphine to get thru this.  Even my Oncol. says that his colleges would say he is treating me OVER AGGRESSIVELY.  But he also states that this is the first time out and although there there is not much information out there with regards to Node neg. women that this is the time for the ""BIG GUNS"".  I am also suppose to do the radiation for 6 weeks 5 x's weekly and currently looking in to seeing if I would be a canidate for Mammosite Rad. instead.
I look forward to any information or links that can help me make an educated decision.  
Sincerely,

							I first got my tamoxifen (20 mg) at CVS for $50 for 30 pills.  I shopped around and then got 90 pills for $47 at Costco.  The pharmacist said that the pricing at Costco must be a mistake.

Is it possible that the Costco pills are not authentic?  They look different from the CVS pills, but is that a problem?  Can they vary in look?  Should I just chalk it up to price gauging by CVS?  Or should I have the cheaper pills checked out, and if so, how and where?

							Hi,
Tamoxefin is the generic name so I would assume more then one company could make it, meaning it could look different.  When I took Tamoxefin 2 years ago, I paid either $101.00 or $110.00 for 30 pills, so that is a huge difference, more so knowing the cost I'm sure has gone up since I took it.  Call and ask them what Arimidex costs for 30 pills.  I pay $213.00 for 30 pills.  I don't think they could possibly sell something that wasn't what they say but again, I would be curious like you.  I can see a $5.00 difference or maybe even $10.00 with something expensive, but that is a HUGE difference.  I don't use CVS, so I don't know what they would get for the Arimidex.
Curious to find out, that's for sure

I wouldn't think that a drug coming from a well-known pharmacy chain could not be authentic. Tamoxifen has been available as a generic product since 2003. Nolvadex from AstraZeneca was the first, branded one, but there are other generic options now. The drug should be exactly the same.

							Thank you Dr. Leo and Muttsmom.  I didn't realized that Tamoxifen is the generic, but I also got the generic from CVS.  I guess I'll ve going to Costco for prescriptions from now on!

Muttsmom, I checked the Arimidex, it's $230 at Costco.  No generics, I guess. 

Thanks for making me feel better about the authenticity of the drug I got!  I'll be going back to Costco.

							Hi, Rachel.  My husband who is a pharmacist at Walgreens says the difference between Costco and CVS is probably just due to difference in cost and how they choose to price the drug.  There are a few manufacturers of the generic and each has a different look so that doesn't necessarily mean anything.  Pharmacy prices just vary from one company to another.  Shopping around is probably a good idea.

							Hi,
I am just wondering why this med is costing you so much money.  Doesn't your health insurance pay for some of it.
I guess I feel very fortunate about the cost of my tamox.  I use to have it filled in the local pharmacy for $10 for 30 pills, but my insurance company now uses a mail in called Express Scrips and I get three month at a time for the same price of $10.  This has been a great service because you don't have to refill it every month.  Also I have a daughter (10) who is a diabetic and I can get all her supplies this way too, which saves me a huge amount of money.
Just a thought, you may want to check it out.  The only thing you need to do is get a 90 day script made out instead of a 30 day, which most doc's will do without a problem.
I have no idea how much the Arimidrex would cost through this program but I am going to get it out.
Take care.

							Hi, Kristen!

I am self employed, and the health insurance available to me is really limited.  I have the best one I could get.  Yet, the maximum they will pay in prescriptions PER YEAR is $500.  This came as a great shock to me, because before cancer, I never even approached the maximum and didn't realized that there was one.  There aren't any options to up that number by paying more, I checked.  And they do not have that 3 month by mail thing either. 

This has really been a hardship.  During chemo, I took Emend, which cost me $282 each treatment,  luckily, the doc gave me samples for the other anti nausea drugs.  And I had to go to a facility every day to get my neupogen shots - if I had gotten them from the pharmacy and self injected (which is what everyone else does!), they would have called it a prescription drug and not paid.  So, as you can imagine, drugs have cost me thousands in the past year.

I am looking for a supplemental prescription program or a supplemental drug program that can give me more coverage.  I doubt I will find one, especially now after my diagnosis.

							Hi Rachel,

I certainly understand where you are coming from.  I too am self employed.  MY husband and I have had a business for 15 years and are paying through the nose for health insurance.  I thank god that I got this health insurance before the cancer came.  My health insurance is HMBO Blue Cross Blue Shield in Mass.  It has been a really good insurance (espescially now) with the express scripts.  I will tell you though, that it cost us $1300 a month for health insurance.  It seems that we are in business just to pay for all the insurance junk (workers comp, liability, health, etc.....)  we are broke just paying for insurances.

							Happy first anniversary, Tammy. I know that this has been a challenging year, and aren't you thrilled it is all behind you? Now it is time to look ahead and focus on the future. I know what you mean about wanting to celebrate with other survivors -- women who have walked this same road. It seems like no one understands us like someone who has ""been there, done that."" The women on one of the other boards I post on have regular gatherings. We've gotten together since 2000. I think there were almost 40 of us together in St. Louis. It is a grand way to share real hugs and get to know each other.  It is always sad when we lose one of our dear breast friends. Since that St.  Louis meeting, I think we have lost about one third of the fine women who were there. Each one of them has been a dear friend and has left a lasting memory. It is sad that so many have died, but I am richer for having known each of them. Happy hugs for you, Lauri

							HAPPY ANNIVERSARY, Tammy!

Lauri is so right.  I feel a special bond with other women who have had breast cancer.  When I went to visit my sis for Thanksgiving in Connecticut, we took the train to New York City.  On the train just a couple seats away from me, there was a woman who had a scarf on (it looked like she was bald under it).  At one point she removed part of her scarf to scratch her head and she was bald.  Then I noticed she had the breast cancer pink pin on.  A  man sitting with her also wore one of the pink pins.  He looked like her dad.  I just wanted to go over and give her a big hug and talk to her but I was too shy.  Some people would like that and others would not.  Later, I regretted that I did not go over to her!  Next time that  happens I will take a chance.

							Hi,

I have a 5mm non-calcified nodule on my right lower lung.  It was diagnosed in September of 2004 by a CT given by the county I work in.  I have had the PET and now have had a regular CT last week.  I have not heard the results yet.  I am 59 years old, not a smoker, and never have been.  I presently do have a cyst on my liver which the are not concerned about, have had an ovarian cyst, resulting in a hysterectomy, had a gangalian cyst on my finger, and a hole repaired on my esophagus.  All of this within 3 years.  The initial report read that if it was a calcified nodule, then only x-rays were needed occasionally, but since it is a non-calcified nodule, then more indepth test are needed because non-calcified nodules lean on the miligant side.  I would like to have a needle bioposy, but am told that it could puncher the lung.   Can someone shed some light on this subject.  It seems that lots of people come up with cyst on their lungs.

Thanks!
						

"
"


							Hello

A lung biopsy is certainly something that should not be taken lightly. But when necessary it really can be done. One has to think about the likelihood of the nodule being malignant or not. The doctors establish this likelihood by examining lots of things: if it is enlarging, how it looks by imaging (CT, PET scan, chest x rays, etc), your risk factors, age etc.

So I would try to get from them what they think about it and if they would indicate it for you. I would think the PET scan is a really good test to tell if it is likely to be malignant or not.

There are five different kinds of non-small cell lung cancers alone and each has its own treatment protocol depending on its type and stage and THE ONLY WAY TO TELL WHICH YOUR BROTHER HAS IS THE FINE NEEDLE ASPERATION.

							Hi Everybody and Dr Leo....

I am wondering who of you that are on tamoxifen and got their periods back. I have been on it for 15 months and had not had a period since 7/03. I went for my six month check at my GYN and she was running a baseline pelvic ultrasound and it showed I had cysts. She watched and they did go away. She also ran that blood test that determines where you are as far as menopausal status. It came back that I was Pre-menopausal, which surpised her because I had not had a period in 15 months, but at the same time when she did the ultrasound, it did show signs of ovarian activity. Then two days later I got my period!!! and three weeks after that I got it again. 

I am 43 and don't really want it back, and would really just like to have my ovaries and uterus out because of all the increased risk of cancer. I go back to my GYN in February to discuss this removal of these pesky organs! 

Did any of you women get your period back after being in ""chemo"" pause? 

Also, My ocon was going to switch me after two years to one of the newer drugs. I guess she was assuming that I would stay post-menopausal. Now I guess I can't get on one of the better drugs...right?? 

Any ideas here would be greatly appreciated.  Dr Leo, any input on having your period back while on tamoxifen would be greatly appreciated!
Thanks,

							Hi Kristen,
I was 43 when dx.  The onco thought I would get my periods back about 6 months after I finished chemo.  I didn't, so he did the lab work and chemo did put me into MENTALpause, so I switched from Tamoxifen to Arimidex.  I was ""thinking"" (dangerous for me to do these days) that someone had said they could give you meds to put you into menopause, and therefore you could take Arimidex or Femara or which ever one they were going to put you on.
I orignally asked for my ovaries to be removed based on my age, stage, etc. but after looking at my case, family history, said that it would not be of benefit.  I thought getting every bit of estrogen/progesterine out of me couldn't do anything but help...... there I go thinking again.... lol
I'm sure Leo can tell you more.  Best wishes

							Hi Nancy,

I know I have heard of women that go on lupron shots but to tell you the truth,  I don't really want to put one more thing in my body.  So right now its either removal of ovaries or stay on the tamoxifen.  Other than the ovarian cysts, (which may be enough to get the ovaries out) I have not had any problems at all with the tamoxifen.
You are lucky you did not get your period back, I really really thought I was done with that!
I guess I also want to just make sure that getting your period back is OK, I seem to be getting every 3 to 3 1/2 weeks, which is nothing like I use to get.  I use to get it 4 to 4 1/2 weeks.
Thanks everybody for responding.
Kristen
						

"
"


							Kristen,

Both things can happen, as reported by other forum readers as well: menopause can be reversible or not. But I understand that if one is not at great risk of having other GYN tumors, with strong family history and or BRCA 1 or 2 carrier, most professionals would not indicate a hysterectomy/oophorectomy.  Probably your best bet would be to finish 2 years of tamoxifen and reevaluate with your oncologist.

hello waljo;

My wife is on FEC100 and the oncologist said basically stay away from alcohol. When we took the chemo class, the onc. nurse said the same thing.

It doesn't mean totally. Special occasions, like Christmas, have a glass of wine or beer but no hard liquor. And, ""a glass"" = ""one glass"" And, only during the middle off week of chemo. The reason given is that you need your liver and kidneys during chemo to handle the chemo, and don't want alcohol to interfere.

My wife and I were regular drinkers a gin and tonic when we first got homw from work. A shared bottle of wine over dinner and a nightcap of a rum and coke. That was our regime nightly.

Initially she has cut back to maybe a single drink each day but after 6 rounds of FEC100 she is allowing the adys that she has a few drinks to become more common. I simplyneed to know chemo is still working in the background. The fact that a drink in the evening helsps her to relax has definite benefits...

<u>Updated:</u> I felt the need to update this because it gives the wrong impression in a few places.  I don't want anyone to take this as ""gospel"", just a snapshot of my experience and mindset at the time.

Well, I was pointed to this site by the changelog of Patrick Volkerding and his Slackware Linux Operating System.  I just switched over to his Linux distrobution right before my severe fit of seizures came out of the blue one Sunday night.  I was wondering why my eyes seemed to be trying to go out of alignment.  I was getting no headaches.  One moment I'm waking up from watching the movie ""Big Fish"".  I realized it was 12:30 and it was way past time to go to bed to get ready for work in the morning.  It had been a really great day.  I remember starting off for bed.  I was heading for the house alarm to set it to ""stay"".  I was in the process of going to the bedroom.  

EDIT: This is what it felt like.  One moment I'm in the living room, the next I'm in the hospital with failing kidneys caused by the severe seizures I had.

I was waking up in the hospital with my wife holding my hand and explaining that I had really scared her.  That was two days later.  Suddenly, all of my family and friends were in the room.  I was wondering how they all got there so fast from Dallas, Tulsa and St. Louis.  It was so good to see everyone at the same time, that it didn't really even hit me that hard when my wife told me I had a tumor and the doctor needed to operate next week.  ""Let's get it done now and go home.  Why the wait?""   It still feels like someone flipped a switch and reality shifted.  Did everything before I woke up in the hospital really happen.  It's like I'm going from reading the book of Luke then reading Romans without ever experiencing the book of Acts.  ""Who is this Paul guy?-

EDIT: It was Luke that wrote Acts, the book that introduced Paul.  Paul, of course, wrote Romans.

-How did I get to the hospital?""  I didn't experience it or remember it.  There are a few things that happened Sunday that I had no recollection of.  It took me a while to remember any of it.  When my wife was asking me about some of it, I didn't remember watching ""Big Fish"" at all.  I didn't remember a group marriage counseling meeting where we watched a video.  I remember the counseling video, now, but just a few scenes from ""Big Fish"".  Well, I might have slept through some of it.

I am now on Dilantin for seizures, now.  I haven't had a seizure, thankfully, since getting on the medicine.  I had the operation and was informed that the tumor is a low grade oligodendroglioma.  Beyond that, I somehow only heard what I wanted to hear.  I heard that it was very treatable.  I heard that it was slow growing.  I heard that we would most likely be able to kill it altogether.  I heard that if I was active, the side effects would be minimal.  

EDIT: Take the following with a grain of salt.  It's not a 10 year death sentence and I don't want to rob anyone of hope.  This is just how I was feeling at the time and based on Google searches.  A doctor will tell you that there are multiple treatments that can be tried and just because one may not work anymore, another one may.  My most recent Neurosurgeon was not afraid to tell me that I could even live my full normal lifetime.

What I didn't hear is that the almost certain recurrence is not treatable, that the recurrence does not respond to the same treatment as the initial tumor.  I just realized a week or two ago that I was on a 10 year death sentence.  That hit me a little bit for something that I have been treated for for the past 5 months.  I discussed it with my wife and got her crying again.  At least now, since I understand the gravity of the situation, I adjusted my stratagy for 401K.  I'm not on the long term plan anymore.  I don't need to worry about what car I'm going to own after my school loans are paid off.  I'm very glad I got life insurance a few months before my diagnosis.  My family will be taken care of.

EDIT:  I started living life again and I did buy my dream car, a Subaru Outback.  In spite of the economy, my 401K is doing all right also.  I managed to time the stock market bottom pretty well.

I'm now on the PCV plan.  It should easily remove the initial tumor and I'll have a few good years of healthy living.  My body is handling the Lomustine, Vincristine and Procarbazine very well and I'm staying active.  My blood levels are in healthy ranges and the tumor is shrinking.  The initial experience has removed from me most any fear of passing.  It also seems to have removed some of my fear of living.  This brain tumor to me is a gift.  The world seems brighter and more full of color.  I am now able to focus on the things that are important.  I am starting to take more time to spend with friends and family.  My unemotional father and brothers are starting to show more feeling and emotion.  I am starting to show more feeling and emotion.

My family and church are praying for a complete healing, for the tumor to go away and never come back.  I am hopeful that God will give me a complete healing, but I won't be upset if he doesn't.  I have been given ten more years to live.  I feel great.  When the time comes, I'll be ready.  Don't pray for me, pray for my family.

Thank you so much for posting. I have just read a book about cancer patients, and the new meaning of life that some encounter seems wonderful. I wish more people had that experience without being diagnosed with cancer. I hope you find support and good people around this forum. I will be here if you need anything.

							This treatment is wearing my out.  I need some prayers myself.  I'm tired of getting the the Vincristine IV.  It's getting harder for them to find my veins and with the expectation of many years left the Dr. doesn't want to put in a port yet.  I'm tired of pumping my body with poison.  It's getting harder to be grateful.  I guess it was bound to happen.  I need to find my second wind.

Well my blood levels are still in safe ranges.  The WBC is the only low one.  It's about 3.5 or so and holding.

							Hi Greg - just saw your posts - it is hard  - I lost my twin brother to a brain tumour 9 years ago, don't know what kind as he wouldn't discuss it, at 50 yrs old he thought he could crack it. Well, his twin now has breast cancer, BUT I am going to crack it! My bc had spread before I had surgery, so not the best prognosis. You sound like a pretty with it guy and have the support of a loving wife and family. Be positive and smell the roses as I do now - we are a long time dead.  Take solace in some of the wonderful people on this forum and of course Dr. Leo - what a saint to do this voluntarily for us whilst running an horrendous schedule as a Registrar ( oops, Resident in the Us).

Take care, you are in my prayers.

							Well, I did eventually get my second wind and I found a nurse who could find my vein every time.  It's much easier to deal with when that trust is there.  My wife would also hold my hand while they did it, so that was comforting as well.

Thursday the 10th of 2005, my oncologist advised me that I was getting my last treatment.  The nurses and staff gave me a ""Purple Heart Graduation Certificate"" that they all signed.  It's a weird feeling being that relieved when I know the next 4 days are going to be filled with the Vincristine side effects.  Bring em on!  The light at the end of the tunnel has arrived.

Thanks for all the prayers, and remember, none of us is out of the woods, so please remember me again in the prayers once in a while.  After seeing how my wife was affected when our Oscar fish passed, I don't want to see what it looks like when she looses a person.

If you have read any of my posts, you know that I am a 13 years and counting survivor of a glioma. I did have a recurrence this year and, yes, it is a little more aggressive. But with proper aggressive treatment, I should have another 7+ years before it returns. By then, there will be even newer treatments and I will have another x years? Although I am very much into survival statistics, I always remind myself that statistics are just that? statistics. 

Greg, you sound like a very spiritual man. Draw strength from your spirituality. One of the first realizations I had was that those cancer cells were MY cells? just growing faster than normal. I tried visualizing the Light irradiating MY cancer. That may sound silly and un-scientific. But it has given my strength to continue on. 

May the un-scientific Light shine on you, Greg.

							Hello everyone,

My name is Lindsay and I am a 24 year old.  I am married and recently moved to VA Beach to be with my husband who is in the navy.  

A month ago I was diagnosed very surprisingly with a brain tumor (I had basically no symptoms).  My craniotomy was on the 15th and I found out this past week that my neurosurgeon had lied to me when he told me that I had oligodendroglioma and that it was benign.  When getting a 2nd opinion last Friday, I was told that oliogodendroglioma is always malignant.  What I have is a combination of stage 1 and stage 2.  The doctor who finally told me the truth told me that the average life span after diagnosis is 7 years.  I will be honest with you and admit that I have been extremely depressed since finding out.

But, that being said, after reading this thread, I do feel some hope, especially from reading about Greg and brainman's experiences.  I am so happy to know that someone managed to live 13 years after being diagnosed.  

What can you all tell me about what I should expect from being on chemotherapy and radiation?  Also have any of you taken part in any clinical trials?  If so, what were they like?  And lastly, have any of you been to Duke for treatment or consultation?  That is where the oncologist where I live is sending me.  I sure hope that they will accept me as a patient there.

Thank you in advance for taking the time to read my post and *hopefully* respond back to me.  I am really scared right now and I hope to get some more hope from you all and to support you all as much as I can as well.

Lindsay,
I'm hoping in the time that has elapsed since you've posted that you've been successful in answering your questions, and securing the appropriate treatment.  Just in case, I'll post what I've learned... of course I'm not a doctor, just a survivor 

The ""good news"" from what I've been told of benign Oligodendrogliomas is that they can be ""cured"" if the neurosurgeon can totally resect the tumor.  If the tumor is in a critical area and can't be fully removed the doctor would probably give you the following options:  1) do nothing else, 2) follow-on treatment, typically with Temodar, since Oligodendroglioma tends to respond well to chemo, 3) Temodar with radiation therapy, or other treatment.

1.  There are 4 grades of brain tumors according to the World Health Organization, grade 1 and 2 are benign, grade 3 is malignant, and grade 4 is aggressive.  Usually, Oligodendroglioma comes 2 flavors, grade 2 (slow-growing, benign), and grade 3 (malignant or ""anaplastic"").  The higher the grade, the more rapidly tumor cells multiply and the more likely they are to spread into neighboring cells.  A pathologist can tell exactly what type and grade of tumor it is, after reviewing a slide with a sample of your tumor under a microscope.  Of course it's important to note that benign tumors do not mean ""harmless"", for two reasons:
1) benign tumors take up space inside the skull, can start to push against the brain, leading to Intra-Cranial Pressure (ICP) and other serious issues.
2) benign tumors if left unchecked have the potential to mutate into a more aggressive tumor (or they might just stay benign!)

2.  I have experience with Temodar, Busulfan, Thiotepa chemo drugs.  Temodar was mild and had very few side effects (little fatigue and nausea).  The Busulfan and Thiotepa were given as part of Dr. Lauren Abrey's clinical trial ""high dose chemo with stem cell rescue"", at MSKCC in New York City.  The treatment was pretty rough, but it was worth it in my case.  IMHO the treatment should fit the tumor -- aggressive tumor = aggressive treatment.

Dr. Henry Friedman at Duke's Tisch BTC returned my phone call when I was shopping around for my best treatment alternative.  From what I've been told Duke has a world class facility there, and solid treatment options -- you should be in good hands.  North Carolina was too far for me

							I was browsing the web for information on my type of brain tumor, as I'm sure most people here would, mine being oligodendroglioma.  I noticed this information on two web sites.  It sounds like a miracle cure that nobody is in any hurry to bring to people who have very little hope anyway.  Is this a case of, Too Good To Be True?

Unfortunately any therapy where a potentially lethal virus is modified and injected into humans will take a lot of time to be approved. The virus can cause a lot of problems both immediatelly and long-term. So scientists will have to have a lot of evidence in animals that this is a safe therapy. But it is encouraging.

							In October I was treated at the University of Alabama, Brimingham (UAB) hospital for colangeocarcinoma (a tumor on the common bile duct where it goes through the pancreas).  Dr. Vickers did a Whipple procedure, and the chief pathologist inspected the removed parts, and noted that the tumor was categorized as a T1, and while the pancreas was not yet involved, that there was an attack on one of thirteen removed lymph nodes and also on one nerve bundle.  They think that they may have gotten it all.  However, there is a significant chance that they didn't.

Now that the surgery recovery is mostly done, the plan is to aggressively treat what might remain with a simultaneous combination of radiation and chemo, in this case using Xeloda (capecitabine).  In reading the literature, Xeloda is approved for treatment of breast cancer and colon cancer,  but nothing else is mentioned.

So my question is this:  has anyone else been through a Xeloda treatment for anything similar?  

Thanks!

Oral capecitabine for the treatment of hepatocellular carcinoma,
cholangiocarcinoma, and gallbladder carcinoma.

BACKGROUND: The goal of the current study was to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of capecitabine in patients with nonresectable hepatobiliary carcinoma.
METHODS: The authors performed a retrospective analysis of all patients with hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), cholangiocarcinoma (CCA), or gallbladder carcinoma (GBC) who were ever treated with oral capecitabine. The medical records of 116 patients with hepatobiliary carcinoma who were treated at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center (Houston, TX) between July 1998 and March 1999 were reviewed. RESULTS: A total of 63 patients were treated with capecitabine (37 with HCC, 18 with CCA, 8 with GBC). Capecitabine 1000 mg/m(2) was administered twice daily for 14 days. Treatment was repeated every 21 days. Each patient received 1-15 treatment cycles. Nine patients (14%)-11% of patients with HCC, 6% of patients with CCA, and 50% of patients with GBC-had either a complete response (CR) or a partial response. A CR was radiologically confirmed in one patient with HCC and in two patients with GBC. The median survival times were 10.1 months (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.5-15.7 months) for patients with HCC, 8.1 months (95% CI, 7.4-8.9 months) for patients with CCA, and 9.9 months (95% CI, 4.4-15.4 months) for patients with GBC. The most common toxicity was hand-foot syndrome (37%). Grade 3 thrombocytopenia occurred in 8% of patients with HCC. No other significant toxicities were observed. For all patients, response to treatment was positively correlated with survival and decline in tumor markers. CONCLUSIONS: Capecitabine was found to be safe for patients with hepatobiliary carcinoma, including those with cirrhosis. The antitumor activity of single-agent capecitabine was most pronounced in patients with GBC, was modest in patients with HCC, and was poor in patients with CCA.

Capecitabine as second-line treatment for metastatic cholangiocarcinoma: a report of two cases.

Stemmler J, Heinemann V, Schalhorn A.

Abteilung fur Innere Medizin III, Universitatsklinik Munchen, Germany.
joachim.stemmler@med3.med.uni-muenchen.de

BACKGROUND: The management of recurrent, metastatic cholangiocarcinoma still remains a problem since this tumor entity is classified as
chemotherapy-resistant. When advanced or metastatic disease is diagnosed, the therapeutic efforts are essentially directed toward palliation. PATIENTS AND
METHODS: We report on 2 patients suffering from metastatic cholangiocarcinoma.
Both had received previous chemotherapy for metastatic disease, including hepatic artery infusion [5-fluorouracil (5-FU) / folinic acid (FA) and oxaliplatin] and a combination therapy consisting of 5-FU/FA and gemcitabine.
Since a progression of the disease was diagnosed, both patients were started on oral capecitabine at a daily dose of 2,500 mg/m(2) in 2 divided doses for 2 weeks, followed by 1 week rest. RESULTS: Capecitabine was tolerated well and severe side effects were not observed. A stop of progression, documented by imaging procedures and tumor marker kinetics, was achieved in both patients.
CONCLUSION: Capecitabine could potentially be used for secondline treatment in patients with progressive metastatic cholangiocarcinoma. Copyright 2002 S.

							Thanks, Leo!

Each case is different, I suppose.  Since I am dealing with CCA, that first abstract is not terribly positive, but then again, single studies are interesting but do not prove a lot.

By the way, I was told by Dr. Susan Russo (radiation oncologist) that I am as blessed as one could be in that the CCA was caught so early (T1 tumor, basically self contained in the bile duct, and no evidence of pancreatic involvement - yet) that there were no statistics for survival/remission for my group.  It would seem that CCA is seldom caught until at least stage 3.  The Whipple procedure removed all of that and a lot more, so there is hope that they got it all, except for the inevitable microscopic particles that no one can be sure of.

So radiation and treatment with Xeloda (1650 mg, twice a day) begins on Tuesday December 28th, all at once.  I will be interested to see just how this goes.  I'll report back once I know more.

Thanks again,

DM

							I thought it a good time to report back.  The six weeks, five days a week, of radiation (250MEV photons from a Varian Cliniac 2100) with Xeloda every weekday was exhausting, but the chemo symptoms were not as bad as any of the literature suggested.  The predicted hand and foot degeneration only showed up during the last week of treatment, and healed up as would blisters - i.e. split open, peeled,  and healed from underneath, during the following month off treatment.

There appeared to be no side effects from the radiation treatment itself, beyond the usual loss of hair where they aimed the radiation generator, i.e. on the stomach, sides, and back, where the radiation hit.  The machine is rather loud, but I didn't feel a thing while it ran.

The second round of Xeloda by itself (14 days straight) is over, and other than exhaustion, there were no visible side effects.  I didn't eat as much, not because anything tasted wrong, but rather because I was too tired to care about food.

Monday I went back to The Kirklin Clinic (University of Alabama  Brimingham Hospital's fabulous facility) for follow up tests, and the CT scan and blood work came out clean.  Dr. James Posey stated that they could find no sign of cancer activity.  I am scheduled for another round of chemo using Xeloda, and then don't have to go back for another scan and bloodwork until I see both Dr. Posey (the oncologist) and Dr. Selwyn Vickers (the surgeon) until July.

So far, so good.  I am very thankful!

New here. 
Glad to hear you're doing good!
My dad was just diagnosed w/ cholangiocarcinoma, and I'm just terrified. I'm doing as much research as possible, but I have to get more specific information from his doctor. 
I was wondering if you did anything else to help with this- diet? vitamins? I'm looking for things to take back to his doctor so we can work with him on this.

							I cannot speak for anyone else on this matter, but my case the treatment progressed so quickly that there was not much time for anything dietary except for making sure I had a few weeks of protein and vitamin supplements in preparation for the surgery.

The first treatment was an ERCP, where they put this instrument down my throat, through the stomach, and into the small intestine, and then worked their way somehow into the common bile duct where they popped it open and placed a stent to keep it open, so that the bile would stop backing up.  They did biopsy work from there, and found nothing cancerous at that time, although Dr. Wilson stated that he had never seen one of these that was not cancerous.

The next treatment was with an ultrasound ERCP, inserted the same way, where they did further investigation, took more biopsy samples, and found nothing cancerous.

The third treatment was the Whipple procedure, where they removed the gall bladder, the head of the pancreas, about a foot of small intestine, part of the stomach, and every lymph node they could reach.  When the pathologist looked at what was removed, he found that the tumor was cancerous, and that it was just beginning to spread, but that they thought they got it all out with the Whipple procedure.

I have a friend who also was treated for cholangeocarcinoma, and she had an easier case.  They were able to determine that it was benign, and removed it through endoscopic surgery.  So not all cases are as complicated as mine.

My advice is to seek treatment quickly.  I have been told that this can be an extremely aggressive form of cancer, and that left untreated it can develop into pancreatic cancer very quickly.  There are several wonderful cancer treatment centers available to you.  Get a referral and go.

							Yesterday was the big day:  Once again we headed down to the Kirklin Clinic in Birmingham, Alabama, for the post cancer checkup.  First there were the blood tests, then the ct scan with contrast, then the two visits with Dr. Vickers and Dr. Posey.  The verdict was that they see no sign of cancer now, and I don't have to go back until January.  This is very good indeed.

After the Whipple procedure October 21, 2004, after the combined radiation and chemo during December, January, and February, and after the rounds of chemo (1650 mg twice a day of Xeloda - Ugh!) which ended in May, life is returning to normal, and I am feeling again like I did before this whole medical event.   

Last week I had a routine visit with the family GP who did the initial diagnosis, and he basically said that when I came in presenting painless jaundice, his initial thought was that I had three months left to live.  All of the paperwork still says pancreatic cancer, which is called a silent killer for very good reasons.  Yet because of great treatment, performed early enough, I am still here and normal life is returning.  

There is a moral to this:  if the doctor suspects cancer, get a referral to the best cancer center available.  Just do it, and do it right away.  Please do not put it off.

							Marty - I've just read through your postings and am thankful for what you have shared.  My Mother had the exact same case as you, down to the procedures and findings.  1 lymph node affeced out of 13.  She has had a rough time recovering from the surgery and was back in the hospital numerous times with nausea and vomiting.  She has finally recovered enough that they are about to start chemo and radiation.  I'm fearful for how she may respond.  How have you been doing since your last posting?
						

"
"


							Life is good.  I am getting some energy back after being extremely tired ever since completing the treatments.  There is continuing gastric distress, and at the beginning of December they perfrmed an EGD (esophogastroduodenoscopy - i.e. they used a fiberoptic snake down my throat to take a look) and found that I have developed intestinal ulcers.  Apparently after the Whipple procedure there is no valving for bile or stomach acid, and so the upper small intestines get a contrant flow of that.  That explains the continued pain.  They are treating that with protonics, which basically eliminates the production of stomach acid, which has its own side-effects.  I cannot take that indefinitely, either, since protonics is carcinogenic over the long term.

There is one other side-effect which bears mentioning.  After the radiation and chemotherapy, there is a depression of the immune system, and there have been recurring bouts with skin fungus (tinea corporis).  The body simply does not work the way it used to.  So beware of all infections and get them dealt with immediately.

But on the other hand I am able to commute an hour each way to/from an engineering job, and am still around to talk about it.  I can sing in the church choir, teach Sunday school, do remodelling at home - I cannot do as much at a time, but it all is doable.  So there is life after cholangiocarcinoma, surgery, radiation treatment, and chemotherapy, although life is a bit different than it was.

I'm glad to hear that you are still doing well, despite a few set backs.  My Mom went back into the hospital on Friday the 13th with a high fever.  Turns out she had an infection in her port.  They removed it and put her on antibiotics and she is well again.  Her Oncologist told her that he can't start chemo and radiation until she has no signs of infection so he wants to wait another 3 weeks.  She had the original surgery in September, so it has been a long time with no follow up treatment.  Her Oncologist has also left the option out there for not doing treatment.  She is 72 and I'm sure he feels like she may live a better quality of life, albeit shorter, without it.  She is opting for chemo and radiation.  She has been a major inspiration to all of us.

							My type of brain tumor, oligodendroglioma, has been estimated to occur in about 3 out of every million people.  The only differentiating factor, so far, is that it happens twice as much among men.  I guess that would be 2 men and 1 woman out of every million.  It's been around for at least one hundred years and I wonder if it has anything to do with radio waves.  I've seen stats that say my type is around 5% of all brain tumors, so, I suppose GBM's are less than 60 out of a million.  These are wild guesses, so, don't quote me on them.  GBM's are the worst ones.  They do tend to work fast.  I can expect around 10 more years myself.

Brain tumors are not that rare. The problem is that they often are diagnosed late, since they grow slowly and cause symptoms only when they are very large. Also our current treatments are not very good, so there is a lot of work ahead.

After my situation, my wife went to the family practice doctor to get her head aches checked out.  He gave her an order for an MRI.  It wouldn't be a bad idea for anyone who is worried about it to do the same.  You could at least avoid the seizures.  Fortunately, my wife's headaches had nothing to do with a tumor.

I do know a few people besides myself who have or had brain tumors.  Most were not malignant.  I know a couple of people who had cancer on the outside of their head.

How does one know to get an MRI?  It would be too expensive for everyone to get one.  I guess you just have to keep an eye out for the smallest symptoms and then convince a doctor you need it.  I wasn't getting headaches but my vision was starting to go a little out of alignment.  Different tumors in different places seem to give different indications, but they are usually not things that we take seriously.  When in doubt, get the MRI.

Oct. 6, 2004 -- People with mental disorders, especially mood problems like clinical depression and bipolar disorder, have a high risk of developing certain cancers at younger ages, including brain and lung cancer, new research shows.

Smoking and alcohol abuse are obvious players in this pattern, both linked with clinical depression and lung cancer in numerous studies, writes lead researcher Caroline P. Carney, MD, MSc, a psychiatrist and internist with Indiana University School of Medicine. Her study appears in the latest issue of the journal Psychosomatic Medicine.

Also, some mental health problems are caused by the cancer. For example, mood disorders like clinical depression have been recognized as an early symptom of brain tumors. The increased pressure in the brain caused by the tumor can cause a variety of symptoms such as seizures or mental disturbances including depression. 

But how does having a mental disorder like clinical depression, anxiety, bipolar disorder affect future cancer development? Her study delves into this pattern more deeply.

Clinical Depression and Cancer

In her study, Carney and colleagues examined the medical claims for about 722,000 adults, filed over a four-year period. Of these, about 72,000 had filed mental health claims. Researchers compared the development of cancer in this group with a separate group who developed cancer but didn't file mental health claims. 

Patients whose cancer diagnosis came within six months of their first mental health treatment were not included in the study since some mental health problems are caused by the cancer and not vice versa. 

People with mental disorders were no more likely to develop cancer than those without mental disorders. However, people with mental disorders were more likely to develop cancer at a younger age and had more brain and respiratory tumors.

As expected, people with mood disorders like clinical depression had higher odds of developing tobacco-related cancers (cancers of the mouth, throat, and lung), writes Carney. People with mental disorders have high rates of smoking and alcohol abuse -- both of which increase the risk of tobacco-related cancers.

She also found:


Mood disorders were the most common mental disorder linked to cancer. Thirty-two percent of men and 43% of women with mood disorders developed cancer less than two years after their diagnosis of the mood disorder. 
Seventeen percent of women and 11% of men had anxiety disorders prior to their cancer diagnosis.

On average, both men and women filed their first mental health claim about one year before the cancer diagnosis, writes Carney. Because of this lag time, it appears unlikely that the cancer caused the mental disorder.

Other patterns emerged for men and women with mood disorders. 

Women with mood disorders like clinical depression:


Had higher odds for developing leukemia and lymphoma -- an ""unexpected discovery."" Even though fatigue and lack of energy are often found with lymphoma -- and could be mistaken for depression -- the time frame for patients in her study eliminated that scenario, she says. 
Were younger than the women in the comparison group when their first cancer claim was filed 
Had higher odds of brain and lung tumors compared with women without mental disorders

Men with mood disorders:


Were 83% more likely to be diagnosed with a brain tumor after their first mental health claim compared with men in the comparison group 
Were more likely to have more advanced cancer at diagnosis 
Had higher odds for developing brain and lung tumors

Counterpoint

Diane Thompson, MD, director of psychiatric oncology at the Winship Cancer Institute at Emory University School of Medicine in Atlanta, was surprised by Carney's findings. 

""Often when patients are diagnosed with cancer, they will say, 'I know this started because of some particular stressor -- a change in job, problems with my spouse,'"" Thompson tells WebMD.

However, researchers have been unable to show a strong link between stress and cancer, she notes. ""There's one exception -- women who have had a long history of chronic clinical depression have a higher risk of dying from breast cancer. This may be due to lack of compliance with treatment."" 

Also, when a patient has a sudden mood change, psychiatrists are trained to look for ""organic"" causes of depression, like brain tumors, Thompson says. These patients should receive brain imaging and other tests, she notes.

But with leukemia and lymphoma -- and pancreatic cancer -- one study showed that clinical depression is the primary symptom patients have. ""It leads us to wonder if the cancer itself is causing depression, if our body's immune system is picking up on it. It may be same with brain tumors,"" Thompson tells WebMD.

Carney's study points to a pattern, ""but don't jump to huge conclusions,"" Thompson says.

Nevertheless, anyone who abruptly develops a mood disorder like clinical depression should always see a doctor, she says.

Chemobrain 

HOUSTON (Ivanhoe Broadcast News) -- Chemotherapy has revolutionized cancer treatment. But with the therapy comes an often overlooked side effect that researchers have dubbed ""chemobrain."" Here's what is and what doctors are doing to stop it. 

Janis Shea works hard to stay focused. ""I'm lost,"" she says. ""I can't say what I want to say right now. My thoughts have just left me."" 
Chemotherapy helped Janis beat breast cancer, but those treatments left her with memory loss and attention problems. It's a phenomenon doctors call chemobrain. 

""Their memory retrieval's very unreliable, so they'll block on words in conversation or forget people's names. It's very aggravating,"" says Christina Meyers, Ph.D., a neuropsychologist at M. D. Anderson Cancer Center in Houston. 

Janis's husband, an oncologist named Renato Lenzi, M.D., says her behavior was unusual. ""She started saying things that were really out of character."" 

Ten years after her treatments, Janis still has trouble paying attention. 
Dr. Meyers says, ""I think a lot of people have that expectation that when treatment ends, the chemotherapy gets out of their body, and they should pop back to normal, and that is not the case at all."" 

It's not clear exactly how chemo affects the brain, but Dr. Meyers says relaxation exercises can ease symptoms. Medications like Procrit and Ritalin are also used to help patients. ""It helps people focus and concentrate, and most of these patients also experience a lot of fatigue, and it helps with their stamina and fatigue as well,"" she says. 
Janis has her own remedies. ""I did a lot of journaling -- an enormous amount of reading,"" she says. ""I read all the time. I think that I'm much, much better. However, back to normal? I don't know. I don't know what this is anymore."" 

But she says she's still trying to get there. 

Dr. Meyers says memory and concentration problems can occur more than a year after stopping chemo treatment. However, she says not all patients on chemotherapy will experience these types of problems. More than half of people on chemotherapy develop significant chemobrain symptoms.

END OF ARTICLE

MY PERSONAL COMMENTS: 

In 2002 when chemo that included Adriamycin was recommended for me, I told both my onc and my internist that I was more concerned about the question of what chemo would do to the brain than I was about whether or not it seriously affected the heart. If it is so dangerous for the heart, what would it do to the brain? 

I was luckier than many, because I was stage 1 and the question of recurrence of cancer was less likely for me. But both my internist and my onc had no answer to my question and yet encouraged me to do chemo. At the time my onc, a top oncologist in his field, said that in his entire career of 30 years he had only had 5 or 6 seriously impaired patients after they did chemo. (My thought was, well.... how many that were not seriously impaired people did you have over time?) 

On my own, because my health insurance would not pay for it, I had a qualified psychiatrist administer some general mental measurement tests to me so that if necessary I would have a baseline for comparison. That cost $250. 

I could not afford a comparison after completing chemo and one has not been done so far, but I am having trouble not only with names but also with the kinds of simple task relationship factors that indicate I do have a problem. For example, today I went to put the blender container on the blender base. I actually tried to put it together without screwing on the circular base portion that fits into the blender base. I am very aware of these problems, but because I work at home no one else but my husband sees me and frequently he doesn't see either as he is not always with me. 

Although in the past I have done things like renting an automobile and driving in the big city on my own, I am terrified now of doing that because I literally cannot recognize when I am not putting ""2 + 2"" together in a random situation. 

I am only 53 years old and this was not part of my life prior to doing chemo at age 51. I do not believe that this is simply part of ""normal aging"". 

I would never advise anyone to do chemo if they are at an early stage. Everyone I know thinks I have pretty much ""recovered"" from treatment now that I am 2 years out, even my husband. But these things happen on a daily basis and I know I have not recovered and may get worse. 
Personally, I believe part of the problem may be due to the lack of adequate oxygenation due to low blood counts. All of my blood counts still are slightly below normal 2 years after treatment. 

It is sad that it took having an oncologist whose wife ended up dealing with it, to start looking away from chemotherapy for better ways to treat human beings who are stuck with the misery of cancer.

							Hi,

I always thought the chemobrain theory was related to how much chemo you did, that the longer you were on chemo the more likely you were to  have chemobrain.  For example, people with mets taking chemo for one or two years seem more likely to experience it.  I'm just guessing.  For myself, I only had 4 A/C and I don't see any after-effects at all at this point in my life.  I finished chemo thirteen months ago.

How can one get chemobrain when they say that the chemo doesn't cross the blood/brain barrrier?  Is that true?  Isn't that why they can't treat brain mets with chemo, but treat it with radiation?  The whole thing is a mystery to me.  Leo, HELP!  LOL

Anyway, I do feel that chemotherapy and its risks are DOWNPLAYED.  I remember I sat in a little cubicle and the chemo nurse went over all the risks with me in a very short time.  He also showed me some written data on chemotheralpy and its risks and more than once he said it was ""overkill.""  Before I knew what hit me, I was signing papers.  

Interesting to see what Leo says regarding the chemobrain theory.

I am 15 months out of chemo and I will tell you that I do have memory problems.  What I notice the most is my train of thought totaly goes out the window in the middle of a conversation.  Its really very strange but I try to just laugh it off at the time, but it is very weird. 
I also just wanted to note that I recently read somewhere that they are not sure now that its the chemo that causes ""chemobrain"" but it may actually be the cancer itself.  If I can find this article I will post it for everybody.

							There could be a lot of reasons for chemobrain, including the cancer itself. For example in my case it could just as well have been the result of using tamoxifen after chemo, which I did for a period of time by medical direction.

In recommending chemo and then tamoxifen to me, my doctors did what is commonly accepted by their peers. It was my choice to make and I made it.

I am currently having exams to find out why I have low-level pain in my right side, as well as low blood counts and high alk-phos and high ALT and AST. I am still considered NED. Abdominal ultrasound and abdominal/pelvic CT have shown no reason. 

I have posted under a separate subject about the loss of libido after starting tamoxifen upon completion of chemo.

For someone who started out with good health, no chronic illness, and as Stage 1 bc, I have to share what is happening to me in the 3 years since dx.

							Kristin, is the article you are thinking of this one...?

""This summer, the journal Cancer published a study from the University of Texas M.D. Anderson Cancer Center that found that among 84 breast-cancer patients, more than 1/3 showed cognitive impairment prior to chemotherapy. Whether the impairment was directly related to the cancer or how cancer might affect cognitive function isn't known, but the study suggests cancer itself might affect a patient's cognitive function.""

							Hi

Anything you consume can potentially damage your brain. Chemotherapy drugs often do not cross the blood-brain barrier, which is there essentially to protect the brain. But some do cross, and damage may happen.

I found a few studies that are really interesting. The first shows autologous bone marrow transplant versus conventional chemotherapy for breast cancer, they identified 31% of patients had cognitive impairment with BMT, as opposed to 17% with standard chemo.

							I have a slow brain tumor that averages a fatal recurrence at about 10 years.  The initial tumor is very treatable, but the recurrence is known to not respond to treatment.  Unless either new medicine is discovered or I am healed, I've got 10 years to live.  I need to discuss terminal issues with her, and I'm learning that this is much more painful for her than it is for me.  In fact, I've reached a point of acceptance and peace with it.  I'm going to research the legal stuff we need to get prepared and decisions on emergency room issues.  There is a lot to get in order.  I need to discuss this stuff.  How do I discuss this with her in a sensitive manner?  I would like her to reach where I am.  I'd like her to look forward to the next 10 years, not be afraid during them.

You are doing the best for your family. Planning ahead is the best thing you can do. I guess you could start by creating an advance directive, and discuss possible scenarios.

I think it's great to be prepared, but don't lose sight of statistics are statistics. Your case may unfold differently than others and it seems about every 5 years, cancer treatments just get better and better.

I had a friend with a good sized brain tumor. One of the medical people treating him said he had barely a 1/3 chance of surviving this thing and guess what, he is one of the survivors. (Sorry if you've heard all this before. Sometimes hearing the same thing a few times from different sources can make it feel more encouraging.)

							hi all i am new to this forum and just got the scare of my life, my doctor did my annual pap and when the results came back they were abnormal, a-typical cells not sure what that means exactly but he basically told me i need a cone biopsy to rule out cervical cancer. so now after i have done some research on the net i am even more terrified than before and am lost on what it is in simple terms not definition. can anyone help me here? has anyone had one before, if so does it hurt (rate pain 1- 10 for me please)? how will it affect my chances of having another child? is there an online support group/ information site decated to this topic?  


"

							Hello

A cone biopsy is simply a procedure where a cone-shaped biopsy is taken from the cervix. This can bleed, and usually it requires some anesthesia, I am unsure what the current practice regarding that is. I also understand that after a cone biopsy your cervix can become incompetent, i.e. not hold the baby's weight, but that is usually controlled with cerclation, where a doctor ties your cervix closed with wires so that it will be competent. Again, not being an OB/GYN I don't know specifics.

							Hi MoMo,

I have learned alot from the results of my husbands blood test.  I would go to internet and pull up labs and then type in the name of the test.  You can get info on why a paticular test is ordered and what the normal range is.  Then compare your husbands test results. For example: You could type in Hemaglobin and it will tell you what that is, what normal is, and what it usually means if its high or low.  I do this on most all of my husbands lab work  because his Oncologist doesnt explain much.  Im sorry about your loss.  I can only imagine what your going through and I hope I never find out but, I do know you can drive yourself crazy with this and unfortunatly it wont bring your husband back.  I hope you find what you need but please take care of yourself.  Heather

I am new to this forum.  What a great place to find information!  I have been reading along but I hadn't posted yet.  So, here I am ready to ask a question.  I just had my second mastecomy on Thursday and had bilateral tissue expanders put in.  I go back to see the plastic surgeon tomorrow to have the bandages removed.  Wanted to ask everyone who had been through this process when did they receive their first ""fill"" and how was it.  I have heard that this expanding process isn't going to be fun.  Would love to hear how everyone else did who had their reconstruction this way.

							Hi Jan,
I had a MRM and then a simple mastectomy on the other side and bilateral reconstruction with expanders.  On the side I had radiation, it was painful and there was just too much damage for the tissue to expand, so I had to have them both removed. If you didn't have radiation, then it will feel funny at 1st (based on my SM side) and you will literally see a boob growing..... lol As long as they don't put too much saline in (50-100CC is normal per visit) the discomfort will ease up before you get another injection of saline.  I wondered how he was going to know where to inject the saline and he used a little metal detector and found the valve in the expander and went right to it.  I'm a whimp and the needle going into the valve wasn't bad at all.
Good luck and let us know how it's goes

							Hi Jan L!
   I'm a new member as of today!  Just saw your question.  I've had both ""boobs"" removed since March, 2004.  The latest surgery on November 11.  I had tissue expanders put on both sides during my latest surgery.  They are painful!!!  It took me about 5 weeks before I could even sleep  on my side!  I thought something was wrong, but my doc said everything looked great!  (Men have no clue! LOL) Got ""pumped up"" again today and it didn't hurt near as much!  I think I might have had so much pain because my right one was put in right after my masectomy.  My left breast was removed in March and so it didn't hurt so much!  But it does get better after there is some healing!  Good Luck!  Let me know how you do!

Hopefully 2005 will bring all of us happiness and health.  Thanks to Lauri and Nancy for the warm welcome to this forum.  Great to hear from Polly!  I was hoping that someone on this forum had their reconstruction with tissue expanders.  I did not have to have radiation so hopefully this procedure will work for me.  I am 43 years old and was diagnosed in Sept. 2004.  I had MRM on the left side on Sept. 30th.  19 lymph nodes were all clear.  Then by choice, I had a simple mastectomy on the right side on Dec. 16 and bilateral tissue expanders during the same surgery.  It has been two weeks and I am not really in any pain but just really tired.  I guess having two major surgeries so close together really took a lot out of me.  I go for my first fill on Wednesday.  I will let you know how that goes.  Have yourselves a great day!

							Jan,

I would like to hear how your reconstruction goes.  I had a MRM on the right and a Simple Mastectomy on the left but I had 3 positive lymph nodes on the right with microcapsualr extension so I have to have radiation on that side.  My surgeon recommended that I wat til 6 months after radiation for reconstruction..so it looks like I'll be having that around the holidays next year.

I've only had 1 surgery and I'm tired especially at the end of the day so I know what you mean about being tired.

							Hi Shelley,

I am one of the lucky ones who found the lump myself in the early stages (2/3).  My diagnosis was Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.  My tumor size was 1 cm and all 19 lymph nodes were clear.  I was offered a second lumpectomy followed by radiation but I chose mastectomy instead.   Since I had the breast removed and with my lymph nodes being clear, my oncologist said that no radiation or chemo was required.  I have been on tamoxifen for 2 months and so far so good with no side effects at all (said with my fingers crossed).  I feel truly blessed.

							Hey Jan!
    I had a masectomy in March and then chose to have the other breast removed in November because breast cancer was so prominent in my family history.  My surgeon said I was being silly.  Lo, and behold, there was a .7 cm tumor in it!  Thank God I listened to my plastic surgeon.  I was just going to have the breast cleaned out with nipple saved, but he recommended that the entire breast be removed so both would match during the reconstruction procedure.  The latest tumor was also Her2 positive which is definitely not good.  Another reason to be thankful.  The tissue expanders were very painful to me at first (the first 4-5 weeks).  I think because they were put under the chest muscles (which is best).  But now 7 weeks later, I'm feeling really good.  I'm up to about a B size and don't even have to wear a bra!  It's great!  I'm 53 years old, in good shape, 138 lbs. so I think I might stop soon at this size.  Keep at it - it's worth it!  Have a great day!  I pray that 2005 will be better for all of us!!!

							Dear Momof5,

I can't remember if my first fillup was 2 weeks post op or 4, sorry!  I too was concerned beforehand.

Don't worry about the fillups.  They should not hurt, as long as your PS does not overfill them on each visit.  My PS asked me to concentrate and tell him when I felt tension as he was filling, and he stopped at that point.  Each person differs a bit on how much they can take comfortably, and it probably varies each time.  I usually took ibuprofin before or just after as a precautionary measure for pain, but never had any pain or discomfort.  And I never had to take a second dose of ibuprofin.  It's better to go for more small fillups than fewer large ones.  

I didn't restrict my activity in any way after the fillups.  

Take this off of your list of things to worry about!

							Hi Polly.....Thank goodness you made the decision to remove your ""other"" breast.  I am still waiting for the pathology report from my second mastecomy.  I will be shocked if anything shows up there.  When I told my plastic surgeon that I wanted the other breast off, he agreed with me.  He said if I was having reconstruction I might as well go for the ""matching twins"".  He also said that peace of mind is very important.  I have two friends both in their 40's that have had this disease twice now.   I just felt like I need to get on with my life and not worry about it coming back.  My tissue expanders were put under the muscle.   The muscle on the side that already had the mastecomy was the only place that really hurt.  But now, at 2 1/2 weeks, I can now sleep on my side which is so great.  I go for my first fill on Wednesday.  How many fills have you had so far to reach a ""B""?

Hi Rachel......thanks for your positive post.  It is great to hear from someone who didn't have a hard time through the fills.  I am actually looking forward to having my first fill on Wednesday.  Have you had your expanders removed and replaced with implants?  What about the nipple reconstruction...did you have that done yet?

I can't give specific advice, but usually when one suspects prostate cancer recurrence, it is common to get a bone scan in addition to a CT scan.

							Hello

I have a question.  When i turned 15 or so i found a small mass on my testicular.  I was instructed to wait to see if it changed, since i had no other symptoms of testicular cancer.   Its been on my testicular for years.  I am almost 22 years old, and it is still the exact same size and shape it has been for about 7 years or so.  It hasn't grown or anything.  I thought it went away a few years ago.  But i just checked today and it is still there.  I'm not sure what it is.  But i have nothing to worry about, right?  I mean, if it was serious or cancerous, wouldn't the effects be strong today?  LIke the lump growing in size?

Thanks

The chances of this being something malignant are very low. But you should be checked by a doctor to be sure.

							I just wanted to give you some more information Leo so maybe you can tell me more about it.  When I was 15 I felt something on my right testicle.  I was just going to see if it ever changed shape or if i felt any more changes.  Anyway, like i said time has went on, and I am almost 22, and it is the same shape and everything.  I played baseball until in was 19, so I always needed physical exams from doctors.  During my physical at 19 i was going to say something, but i felt down there and i didnt' feel it...i thought it was gone.   HOwever, i felt down there maybe 2 weeks ago and it is still there.  I've had a bunch of phsycals for baseball...and even a few times my doctor, a part of the routine examination, has checked my testicles and has said nothing.  I've taken urine tests with each physical.  I was just wondering with this information if you could tell me with any certainty what this might be.  I phsyically feel the same as i have for the past 7 years.  Of course i get a sore throat or a cough every now and then...but i've never been extremely ill.  Thanks

You might have felt the epididymus which is like an attachment in the posterior side of both testicles, or maybe what is known as varicocele, sort of varices of the veins surrounding the testicles. But I can not be certain at all, but most likely you do not have anything serious, nevertheless you need to be checked.

							Hello everyone,

Well my surgery is overwith and the path report came back.  They found the primary tumor in the axillary tail behind the lymph nodes, it was 1 cm.  I had 3+ / 14  lymph nodes.  The largest of which was 4 cm.  But the doctor said he'd rather see fewer large nodes than many small nodes.  One of the nodes had microscopic extracapsulary extension so that means radiation after chemo.

Anyway, now that the surgery part is over, I'm beginning to think about the chemo part.  And I'm dreading it big time!!  I'm due to start in mid-Jan.  Does anyone have any tips on making it easier??  I am mentally prepared for losing my hair...at least I think I am.  I plan on getting it cut really short after my treatments begin.  I have read so much on how this affects everyone and I hope I'm ready for that part.  I especially am worried about the nausea part.  Someone told me to bring a cooler with me and drink as much as I could while receiving the chemo to stay hydrated.  Any other tips would be appreciated.

Merry Christmas!!

							Hi Shelly,

Now that your surgery is over you can continue to KICK CANCER BUTT.  You've already did a very large part by having the surgery.  And remember that positive nodes do not guarantee that you will have a recurrence down the road.  Many women with positive nodes go on to do very well.

Here is a helpful chemo site:   www.chemocare.com  You'll find a lot of good tips, including eating healthy during chemo.

This is what worked for me:

Drink lots of water the day before, during and after.  During treatments I always drank from my water bottle.  I kept refilling it during the chemo treatment.  The chemo enters your body and does its job of killing cancer cells and then you want to get it out of your body asap.  That's what my chemo nurse told me.  The best way to do this is to drink lots of water!  Also, if you received A/C you want to eliminate it from your body quickly.  My chemo nurse told me to get up in the middle of the night the first night to make sure I emptied my bladder.  A/C can be nasty sitting in your bladder.  In fact, it's a good idea to drink lots of water during the entire chemo experience.

I had one of those nutritional drinks (Boost) every day to get extra protein.  This was also suggested by my chemo nurse.

Eat whatever appeals to you.  For me, it was rotisserie chicken and Nesquick cocoa.  LOL  My sweet DH was always running out to pick up the rotisserie chickens!  Smaller meals work best for most folks.  There were some foods I developed an aversion to and I just avoided them.

Take your anti-nausea meds around the clock for the first 3-5 days.  I took them for the first 5 days.  I even set the alarm clock.  I was very diligent about taking my meds on time.

I can't help you too much with the hair thing because that just didn't bother me too much.  It was kind of nice not having to mess with hair every day!  LOL  Even now, I'm sporting short 'n sassy cuts because I got so spoiled during my chemo days.  I had never had short hair in my life and I discovered I looked great in short hair!  LOL

Good luck.  You'll do fine.  Remember, lots of people get through this and so will you!  If you have any more specific questions during chemo, ask away and someone will answer them for you.

Happy Holidays,

Margie

							Shelly ~ I forgot to mention one very important thing - constipation.  The constipation is very real and can be very serious.  My advice:  Be preapred before it hits.  Many women take Senekot.  I didn't use any drugs.  Instead, I drank prune juice and ate dried fruits, esp. raisins.  Ask your oncologist or chemo nurse what they recommend.  You should always check with them before you add any drug, even an over-the-counter type.

Take care.

							Hello Shelley;

My wife was diagnosed ILC with 10/14 nodes positive. The good news is that the oncologist has said that after chemo and radiation she has less than a 10% chance of recurrance.

So far as chemo goes, my wife had heard every horror story out there from well-meaning people who should keep their mouths shut, IMHO. (Not on this board or www.breastcancer.org, BTW). Her own sister kept referring to it as ""draino."" The reality was very different.

She drank litres and litres of water before the 1st chemo and all the time since. We were prepared for a lot of nausea and I had a ""barf-bucket"" all ready to go beside the bed. Around 8pm she felt a bit queezy so she took the extra nausea pill and then some gravol as directed. I also got a number of on-line friends to pray and the nausea went away. It has not returned and we are approaching chemo #3 on Dec 31. Her appetite has been fine, too.

I guess what I am saying is that you should be prepared by doing what the chemo unit tells you to do. They said ""drink water,"" and my wife drank water. They said ""take your meds,"" and my wife took her meds right on time. If they had said 'stand on your head,"" I would have insisted she do that as well..... This does not mean all will go as well with you as it has for Cathy, but it should give you the hope that it is not all doom and gloom like some people like to say.

Cathy did not think she would be bothered by her hair, until it happened. She got it cut short around day 14 and it was hard on her. She was surprised at her reaction. It still is a little prickly so I took my electric trimmer and got the rest off last week.

Hope this helps. If you can get some people lined up to pray for you it will help.

Margie,

Thanks for your advice.  I'll keep it in mind.  Have a wonderful Christmas and a happy healthy New Year.


Pastor Rich,

I'm so glad to hear that your wife is doing well with the chemo.  I know prayer does make a difference and it seems like I have half the country praying for me now.  I get cards in the mail from churches that I'm not even sure who goes there...but I'm thankful for every prayer I can get.  I have family in FL, GA, NC, KY, TN, CO, IL, MN, Japan and the Turks and Caicos Islands and friends in HI, WA, and everyone has put me on the prayer lists at their churches.  It is amazing the people who will come to support you when something like this happens.  I'm truly amazed everyday.

I've heard to drink lots of water from everyone I've talked to so I guess I'll plan to do that.  

Hope your wife continues to do well and that you all have a very merry Christmas and a happy healthy new year.

							Hi Pator Rich,
I want to ask a question, but not sure how to without sounding like a gloom and doom.  I'm almost 3 years out and was also Stage III ILC, so I know that we can do well.  The AMS says a totally different stat then your onco told you and your wife, which I know stats are just that, numbers.  What did he base his 10% chance of reoccurence on?  I know being 43 when dx is against me, and my onco doesn't like giving stats or odds because he said it's all a crap shoot.  I had the FEC too, just like Cathy and again, so far so good with me and I'm thrilled about that, but I was told it was about a 50/50 chance of having a reoccurence at stage III, but being er/pr+ helped and made it more in my favor.
Thanks

I know you must be so anxious about the chemo...I know they have many new drugs that make the nausea better. I will find some of the articles I kept on chemo and pass them on to you... Yeah ! for the successful surgery and that the tumor is small... It sounds like they are going to do everything possible to treat and tame the beast. I know you are in good hands.  I have been cleared by Vista to go to Moffit, so I will be scheduling for sometime soon.... love you, Hollis

							Hi Muttsmom;

Cathy is 54 and the hormone tests were positive.

Some of the newest studies this year with ILC show that the outlook is far better than previously determined. Lobular is usually diagnosed later than ductal and has a higher stage at time of discovery, but it responds much better to treatment by something like 30+%

I don't know how the oncologist got to his numbers.... He was the radiation onc. At our hospital we have seen almost every onc. doctor from visit to visit. None wanted to give stats untial after all the tests including hormone status. But I think one of them did say that without treatment, chance of recurance was 50%. With chemo it was about 20-30% better. So the numbers start to line up.

							Hi Shelley:  I agree with everyone else -- water, water, water.  I was like you and had heard all the bad stories and had myself prepared.  I just finished my 3rd treatement today and have never had problems with nausea.  Headache for the first day and tired on the second day but other than that have felt good.  Everyone reacts differently.  A positive attitude goes along way with making the process easier I found.  One tip that a friend told me that has been my savior...you may start to get mouth sores because the chemo dries out the mucus membranes.  Get Biotene toothpaste and Biotene mouthwash.  They put back the extra enzymes that are being taken out of your system and stop the sores from developing.  I wasn't sure how I would handle the loss of hair.  I cut it short twice to get used to it and when it fell out, it was a depressing day.  Now I'm used to it and so is the family so it's not a problem.  Good luck.  Our prayers are with you.

							Hey!  Let's hope that for you, as it was for me, the anticipation was much much worse than the reality!  I did really well on chemo.  After all the things they read to you about side effects, I know that you can only picture yourself lying in bed retching for days.  But that doesn't happen to everyone.  In fact, I NEVER HAD ONE MOMENT OF NAUSEA!  So be prepared, but don't assume it's gonna happen to you.

I agree with what the other women have posted, but the water is more for flushing your body than for hydration, I think.  And I got hungry while I was being infused (or bored!) so bring something to eat also.  If you don't have a port (I didn't) bring something to do that does not require much hand moving, since you will have the IV in.  Wear comfy clothing so you can nap, I loved my sweats and thick socks.

As far as meds are concerned - I had dose dense - 4AC then 4Taxol 2 weeks apart.  I took 2 anti nausea meds - Emend (hour before chemo, next morning, morning after that) and either Kytril or Anzimet (the doc gave me samples) chemo night, and the next 2 mornings and nights (nights optional).  And never a moment of nausea.  Emend is new, it's expensive, but for me it was terrific.  That was during the AC.  No one really told me that I wouldn't need it for the Taxol part, so I did the same thing for 3 out of 4 taxol.  Stupid me.  Anyway, the last taxol, I took nothing, and was just fine.  Apparently taxol is not nausea producing for most people.

On AC, I always had a lost day - Monday after chemo Friday.  Sometimes it was a day or 2 more.  However, I was tired, and conked out much earlier each night than usual.  And got up really early!  Which I really liked.  I could do normal things, but did not have alot of energy, and the idea of dragging the laundry basket up and down 3 flights of stairs really didn't appeal to me.   I also coddled myself and didn't do to much - on the 3rd AC, I spent 5 hours cleaning the basement, lifting boxes, etc, and that laid me flat for days and days, so I was very protective for the rest of the time.  Too protective maybe.  Taxol was much easier.  The steriods make you a bit peppier, and I found my energy coming back a bit.  

By the way, my taste stayed the same throughout.  I always ate a big meal on chemo night, and my appetite did not (unfortunately!) go away, although as time went on, I found that smaller more frequent meals were better than the usual three.  I never got mouth sores, but for about 2-3 weeks my mouth was sensitive to my usual toothpaste and mouthwash, so I switched to Biotene, which worked great.

If you are getting Neupogen or Neulasta shots, you may get some bone/muscle/joint pain - I took ibuprofin and it went away.  

For Taxol, look into taking L-Gluetimine (sp?).  Some people recommend taking it every day while you are getting chemo, my nurse recommended it for a few days after each Taxol.  It is supposed to help with avoiding neuropathy, and other Taxol side effects.  I sometimes took it, sometimes not (bad with these things!) but I had little neuropathy (a bit of numbness on the soles of my feet, went away by 5 months post chemo; some messed up fingernails, grew out).  

Good luck, girl!  Get your wig and scarves and happy videos ready, and step out onto that road that none of us wanted to take.  The good thing is, that although the end is not now in sight, you get there somehow, sooner than you can imagine, and healthy!   It's all just temporary, all this chemo.  Living long, now, that's the thing you have to keep your sights on.

							Hi Dr. Leo -
my history is invasive ductal carcinoma, 2 cm, with associated intermedicate DCIS, tumour grade and stage 2. I had WLE and total axillary removal Feb/Mar 2003, 3+/18 nodes, followed by 6 x FEC and 45 rads. Finished all treatment end Nov 03. Followup with breast surgeon March 04 and mammo clear. I also have chronic Cron's - since 1970, under control now with methotrexate.

Some 2 months ago I had acute erysipelas and was hospitalised; treated with erythmoycin and now clear. 10 days later I had a blackout and was unconscious for 30 mins until paramedics arrived and I was given oxygen. I was taken to hospital by ambulance and kept in for observation for 24 hrs. ecg was normal, BP 100/50 as it was with the erysipelas.

I saw my gastro last week and he thinks I may have had a transient ischemic attack (my mother died of strokes) and has advised me to stop smoking - I am seeing a nurse counsellor for this on 30 Dec but have already cut to 3 a day.

However, I happened to see a neighbour today, who is a GP in another town, and she was here when I had the blackout. She suggested I may have brain mets as I have no sense of smell or taste. The blackout resulted in injury to the occipital (sp?) and a boggy haematoma.

Is it possible that I may have brain mets? We only get 3 yrly mammos here in England from 50 yrs, and my tumour was not palpable, so it is possible I had it for some time before diagnosis.
I really do not know what to do next. I was discharged by my Oncologist in Feb 04 and am not due to see my breast surgeon for annual check up until March 05.
I would be grateful for any insight you may have.
Thank you for a wonderful site and all the effort you put in.
Liz.

							Hi Liz,
I know you wrote to Leo and I wouldn't begin to give advice on something I don't know anything about.
You said your onco discharged you this year?  In the states, you see your onco every 3 months for the first couple of years and then every 6 months and after 5 years it goes to once a year.  I'm sure there is some various to this, but that's in general.  I can't believe that he just basically said you were on your own after a year.  I'd call him and make an appt. or get an earlier appt. with your surgeon, or even get one with your PCP and any of them can order a MRI or CT Scan of your head.  I don't know and haven't heard of some of the things you mentioned in your post, so again, I'm not suggesting that it does or doesn't sound like mets, but you can't just sit there and worry about it.  Call those docs and get in with the 1st one you can.  The waiting and wondering and worrying is a horrible thing.
Best wishes and please keep us posted
You're in my prayers

							Hi Dr Leo - thank you for such a prompt response.
The neurologist I saw in the ER and the Medical Admissions ward did some tests on my hands and vision and ordered an ecg, but no scan of my head and no follow-up appointment. I didn't realise then that my sense of taste and smell had disappeared as I didn't eat whilst in the hospital. I think I will ask my GP (PCP)'s wife - the nurse I am seeing about quitting smoking - if I should see him for a referral to a neurologist at the hospital. My GP can't order scans, it has to go through a consultant at the hospital. I don't know if I had a seizure as the power went out just before I blacked out and it was a few minutes until my husband could get a torch. I don't remember anything after I got up to get some candles - next recollection was being put in a wheelchair and having an oxygen mask, which was around 30 minutes after the fall. The only symptoms I have are extreme dizziness on standing up and the loss of taste/smell. I guess it was a tia, but with local spread of my bc I just wondered if it could be brain mets. Either way I need to know so I can get appropriate treatment.

Another thing: it's not too uncommon for people to have diminished taste and/or smell sensation after chemotherapy. But this can be a neurological symptom of somethin in the central nervous system as well. But it really sounds like it needs to be looked into.

Some of us have been batting this question around and thought you might help us.  Many of us were told when we had our original diagnosis that the cancer had been growing for years to get to a point where it could be noticed.  Then why is recurrence more likely within the first years after surgery?  Since the original tumor took so long, why do some suffer recurrences so quickly, despite stage, grade, ER/PR status or whatever?

Thanks for any help you can give us,

							Hi Cassie,
I'm definately not trying to answer for Leo because I'd like to try to understand this more too.  I know why I was 2 years NED, my onco said he was ""encouraged"" and when I asked what did he mean, he said that it shows that the cancer wasn't chemo resistant and it wasn't real aggressive.   I've known a few ladies that have had reoccurences in less then a year after dx and then I've seen ladies that have a reoccurence after 6, 8, 12 years.  I know that is just one reason why it would come back quickly.  It is strange how we're dx and can have it back in our liver, bones etc. so fast when it was growing for many years before we could either feel it or a mammogram pick it up and then it can go nuts after treatment.
I'll be checking for Leo's answer too, to this very good question.  
We need a cure for this mess and be done with it.  Going through it once should be more then enough!!!!

							Hello

You pose a very interesting question, which is being looked into by many research folks. The quick answer is: we don't know how tumors will behave. We all know that some are more aggressive than others, and also know some markers of which ones can be more aggressive: poorly differentiated, ER/PR negative, HER2 etc. Also it seems that after getting chemotherapy, the  recurrence is usually more aggressive, and also resistant to the previously given chemotherapy. Another thing is that after a tumor is metastatic, the biology of the tumor is different: once it is able to travel through the bloodstream or the lymphatic system it has then shown how aggressive it can be. So there are a lot of reasons for the recurrences to grow faster, but in the end we don't really know which tumors have a higher potential for recurrence.

							My name is Greg. I have CLL. I took chemo treatments 3 years ago and was OK until this fall. The Dr. said my bone marrow is ""70% packed"". Is this an indication of what stage my cancer is at? I am looking into a bone marrow transplant.
						

"

							Hello

Thanks for posting. Essentially with CLL your bone marrow will have a lot of CLL, and this does not change your stage. What will change your stage is the consequence of the bone marrow disease: anemia, thrombocitopenia, enlarged spleen and/or liver, etc. 

There are two staging systems for CLL: Rai and Binet. 

Rai staging System

Stage 0
Stage 0 chronic lymphocytic leukemia: absolute lymphocytosis (>15,000 per cubic millimeter) without adenopathy, hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia.

Stage I
Stage I chronic lymphocytic leukemia: absolute lymphocytosis with lymphadenopathy without hepatosplenomegaly, anemia, or thrombocytopenia.

Stage II
Stage II chronic lymphocytic leukemia: absolute lymphocytosis with either hepatomegaly or splenomegaly, with or without lymphadenopathy.

Stage III
Stage III chronic lymphocytic leukemia: absolute lymphocytosis and anemia (hemoglobin <11 g/dL) with or without lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, or splenomegaly.

Stage IV
Stage IV chronic lymphocytic leukemia: absolute lymphocytosis and thrombocytopenia (<100,000 per cubic millimeter) with or without lymphadenopathy, hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or anemia.

Binet classification

Clinical stage A: no anemia or thrombocytopenia and fewer than three areas of lymphoid involvement (Rai stages 0, I, and II)

Clinical stage B: no anemia or thrombocytopenia with three or more areas of lymphoid involvement (Rai stages I and II)*

							Hello

It seems that her COPD is advanced enough to make her respiratory status quite fragile. You will have to discuss with her and the doctors about the likelihood of this being cancer, and her eligibility for surgery if it is indeed cancer. If her COPD is bad enough, maybe she could not live after having part of her lungs resected, so that's why it is important to think ahead.

							I see the board is pretty quiet this week. I hope everyone had a good Christmas. DH, DS and I drove from Minnesota to Indiana to celebrate with DD, SIL and DGD and SIL's parents. It has been a delight to watch DGD Melanie Rose, who is 16 months old, play with all the new toys. Of course, the grandparents are only to happy to keep her occupied. What a cutie she is! We have a houseful here, and there is more snow in Indiana than in Minnesota! Hard to believe. However, the forcast is for days in the 50s by the end of the week, so the snow will go. We are heading back home Wednesday or Thursday and will take two days. Happy New Year to all and may 2005 bring us closer to a cure. Hugs, Lauri

							You can get a free subscription to CURE magazine if you are a cancer patient (survivor) or care giver.  It comes out 4 times a year it is NOT a gloom and doom magazine.  It tells all the progress being made and each issue has a type of cancer that is the focus, but all types of cancer are talked about in each magazine.  I think the BC one was either Spring of 2004 or Winter of 2003.  Again, it will discuss BC in every issue, just may not be the main topic and updates on trials etc. http://www.curetoday.com/freesubscriptions/

							Hi Nancy,
I just wanted to say how great this magazine is.  I have been a subscriber since my dx in april 2003.  I also remember the breast cancer issue that you are refering to.  I think that anybody that wants to check out that issue may find it online in the back issues.  This bc issue was full of really good information, especially if you were newly dx like I was at the time I discovered this magazine.  I always look forward to getting the new issue in the mail, and you are right, its not a gloom and doom magazine.  Its a highly informative magazine with all the newest and upcoming treatments and detections that are available and will be available.  
Anyway, I highly recomend checking this out like Nancy suggested.
I hope you all have a great New Year!

							I agree with everyone here about this magazine...it is the BEST.  I am of the belief that we need to know all the info we can just in case we need it .  I wish I had known more about breast cancer so I could have known the right questions to ask my doctors.  I also realize that until you have it or some other terrible disease, you don't know what to ask.  I think it is such a scary thing, that we put it out of our minds as long as life is going along ok.

							Hello everyone,

I had a MRM on the right side and simple on the left back on Dec 9th.  The drains were removed on Dec 20th.  Left side is fine but on the right I have some swelling.  I think it may be collection of the fluids that drained through the drain.  It doesn't hurt or anything.  I was just wondering if anyone else had this problem and if it eventually goes away on it's own or do i need to call my doctor
						

"
"


							It's probably a little fluid collection.  Your surgeon may have to drain it.  I had to have my surgical area drained a couple of times and finally had to have the drain in for another week.  Hopefully you won't need that, especially if you catch it early.  I didn't feel any discomfort when he drained the site.

Take care and good luck to you!

							Hi Shelly,
I'd go get checked to be sure you don't need to have some fluid drained.  If you're talking about down your side of the MRM vs. on the chest area itself, I felt like I was swollen there also.  I guess we don't notice it when we have breasts, but there is tissue on the side that was all connected.  Mine wasn't fluid, but that tissue that just became obvious to me once the breast was gone.  With it being on the MRM side, that very well is what it could be.  It will always feel swollen and numby feeling, but it becomes our new ""normal"" and you don't think about it after awhile.
Take care and keep us posted
Nancy
						

"

							Well I did talk to my surgeon yesterday and he said a bit of swelling is normal and that some of it may be from the drains but that the body would absorb it.  He did tell me if it gets uncomfortable or begins to hurt to call him back.

							My husband has developed Refractory disease while being treated for CLL.  He needs a bone marrow/stem cell transplant but that cant be done untill his wbc count drops. Currently the count is around 400,000.
This Monday he will start on a Monoclonal Antibody called Campath (Alemtuzumab).  We understand this will totally wipe out his immune system.  Is there anyone out there who has been treated with this or anyone who can give me any info on it? Thank you,  Heather

I have seen a few patients receive Campath. It is a really immunossuppressive drug. I understand this is probably the only way that he can be bridged to transplant, right ?

							Leo,

Yes, according to the Oncologist this is the only way to get the wbc count down for a transplant.  

Leo, I was told by a friend that one doesnt  actually develop refractory disease.  They are Fludura refractory from the start.  Is that your understanding?  Also, is it standard procedure to do a FISH test immediatly upon diagnosis? 

One more question. Do you think at this point my husbands siblings should be tested to see if any of them are a full match for Peripheral Blood Stem Cell Transplant.  Our Oncologist says its to soon and that 'they' will do that wherever he has the transplant done also  'they' will deside what type of transplant is needed.  

Thank you Leo, Heather
						

"
"


							Heather 

For an allogeneic transplant (from another person), most centers will take only quite young people, I think 55 is a resonable cut-off. This is because the mortality related to the transplant is quite high, and older people just do not do well after an allogeneic transplant. An autologous transplant is quite a different story. It is also called high-dose chemotherapy, where you essentially collect stem cells from the patient, give the chemotherapy, and give the stem cells back, so there are no complications related to rejection of graft-versus-host disease that we see with allogeneic BMT. 

Anyway, I honestly think that there is refractory disease. But Campath may be a good choice, and there is one study that even mentioned combining fludarabine with campath. 

Still about the BMT, your family can be tested quickly, so unless there is a real plan to proceed with allogeneic BMT, they do not need to be tested right away.

best regards,
Leo

							Thanks for the info Leo.  What about a FISH test.  Is this test standard procedure at time of diagnosis, before chemo starts? Will this test confirm a person has fludurabine Refractor?  Thank you, Heather

FISH stands for Fluorescent In Situ Hybridization, and is a technique that can look for any DNA sequence. So you can look for anything. When you say a FiISH test, you have to ask: for what ? What molecule do you want to target ?

							Heather, please bear with me, because I am new to computers and have never been on a forum before. I would like to share my experience with Campath with you.  I went to Cleveland University Hospital Ireland Cancer Center because I wanted to get into the trial for campath with a autogolous transplant.  I was first given propylactic  medications as anti viral, anti fungal, and antibacterial,  and then given fludara for three months of treatment.  I had taken lukeran by mouth up until then and was nervous of IV therapy   I did well and was bone marrow clear after this therapy.  The doctor wanted to stop there, but I told her that I had come to the large hospital to try to recieve a cure, and I wanted to persue that.  I started on coral calcium at that time on the advice of several unrelated friends and family telling me about it in a three day period.  I thought it was a nudge from above, and seeing I had had a platelet count below 75,000 for years and years, I was surprised to see it shoot above 135,00 in three weeks, and this was good because I needed a count above 100,000 to get into the trial.  I took campath then and had to take benedryl, steroids by pill daily and IV before every treatment.  I had allergic reactions to the campath and they would give me more benedryl pushes to stop them.  Really, I felt tired more as the treatment progressed and had a terrible time with a poorly placed chest catheter, but I didn""t loose my sence of humor throughout the treatment.[And I can loose my jolly's when things get painful!]  I couldn't have the transplant because of not harvesting enough stem cells[through bad medical decisions and treatment] but even though my doctor gave me about eight months to be healthy, I am going on mythird year of no sign of the CLL in September.  I had trouble with pneumonia after the treatment, but remember, I had heavy duty cytoxan to try to harvest, so I don't know if I would have been as bad with only the campath.  I would not hesitate a moment to have campath again, and it would be, in fact my treatment of choice with the now available choices.  I am 52 and have had this since I was 38 and I cannot remember feeling this good or having this much energy.  The worst downside for me was the massive weight gain with the steroid.  Every time I would start to loose, I would have to have my streoids upped becouse of the lung problems.[I had some previous to the CLL]  Small price to pay to feel so good. As for the tests, I think your doctor should order all available staging tests for CLL to be performed on your husband.  Cll Topics is a good place to go to find out all of the information you may want to arm yourself with before you talk to your doctor again.  If you are seeing a local onco/hemo  and they don't want to do the tests, GO TO A CANCER TREATMENT CENTER!  The bad part about being treated at a large hospital is being worked on by untrained people who are  practicing on you.  This caused me some bad experiences, but the high quality of knowledge is worth the trip.  You can go there and get their best recommendation and if your local will cooperate, get the treatment at home.  I hope I helped you.   And I wanted to add a word of advise I recieved.  Follow the old transplant guidelines for being careful about infections.  The new therapy available gives  patients more freedom, but why eat in restraunts, and not wash all fruits and vegies in soap before cooking if it could help?  Good luck and GOD BLESS YOU!

							I was diagnosed with breast cancer in March, 04.  Had a masectomy on my left side and 4 rounds of chemo.  Lymph nodes were negative.   THEN in November, I decided to have my other breast removed because of several risk factors.  To my utter surprise, there was a .7 cm tumor in it also.  The first tumor in my left breast was 7.5 cm x 3.5 cm, pretty big.  In the first tumor the path report said estrogen/progesterone negative; her2 negative.  The right breast's report was estrogen/progesterone negative, but the her2 was positive!  Does anybody know if this happens often?  My doctor said I was a very unusual case and that he was going to call other doctors and do more research from University of Alabama.  Anybody heard of this before?  Please help!!!  I'm to see my doc on January 6 and he's to tell me IF I'm to take chemo again!  Don't know what to do????? Thanks!  Happy New Year by the way!

							Hi

For people with high risk of breast cancer, there may be very well a second primary tumor, which I suspect that is your case, since the biology of the tumors is different. I am sure from this you may need to get more surgery and/or more chemotherapy depending on what your doctor thinks. You might need your lymphnodes checked since you only had a simple mastectomy. It is definitely not a simple case.

							Hi Leo:
   Thanks for the info.  When I had my last masectomy, they did not check the lymph nodes because the doctor did not know the cancer was there because it was so small.  However, after finding out about the .7 cm tumor, they did go back in and check them.  No cancer in 11 lymph nodes taken.  I go back to my oncologist this Thursday.  Will let you know what he says!

He tried me on 20 mg of zocor and now I'm up to 40 mg.  The triglicerites (sp) are 620 and the machine won't calculate anything over 400 and I know 275 is ""very high"".  This is the 1st time I've had it checked since chemo.  Would the Arimidex or treatment itself have any affect on cholesterol?

							Hi,
I put on about 30 pounds during chemo, I'm assuming because of the steriods they give to help with the side affects.  I put on about another 10 with the 8 surgeries in less then 3 years.  This is by far the most I've ever weighed.  Most of the weight gain has been in my stomach, which I was told was common with menopause and the chemo put me into that.  I've pretty much stayed at the same weight since I started taking Arimidex in 2/03 and I started off with Tamoxefin, but only for about 6 months.  It doesn't matter what I eat, how much I exercise or anything, I can drop about 6-7 pounds and that's it, so I'm sure the Arimidex isn't helping.
Are we having fun yet?  UGH

							Hello

After a little research this is what I got on aromatase inhibitors and lipid profile:

- exemestane (Aromasin) has no effect on cholesterol, and decreases triglycerides.
- anastrozole (Arimidex) tends to increase cholesterol and LDL

This needs to be monitored. High cholesterol and high triglycerides are a huge risk factor for cardiovascular diseases. It is not always related to diet. Familial predisposition plays a role. Plus, currently we have good cholesterol-lowering drugs.

							Thanks for the info Leo.  My concern is that I'm taking 40mg of Zocor, but my PCP says he'll need to monitor my liver enzimes because Zocor can be toxic to the liver.  Could this ""weaken"" my liver and make me more prone to liver mets?  It never ends does it...... geesh

No, that does not ""weaken""your liver. Any statin can cause elevation in the liver enzymer, that's why we monitor patients. Most patients do fine and their liver enzymes remain normal. Another drug that can be added to the regimen is Zetia, which is kind of new and is showing a good benefit in people that need higher doses of statins or are maxed out.

I couldn't agree more.  When I was dx in 2002 it was 1 out of 9 women would get breast cancer in their life time and in 2004, it's 1 out of 7.  When is it going to stop?  When it's gets to 1 out of 6, the odds will be the same as playing russian roulette and that's scary.
I personally think they need to quit spending as much on ""awareness"" and more into research.  I don't mean to sound cold, but any woman who's not heard of BC, mammograms (even though mine missed a 5.5 cm tumor), self breast examine has had their head in the sand.
I lost one of my best friend friends 12/1 to this disease and she was 48.  I think they need to recheck their ""stats"" as I've seen more woman under 50 with BC.  Not to say there aren't alot over 50 out there, but most of the ones I've met are in their 30s and 40s.  
They are saying that the reason the number is going up for woman with BC is because of early detection.  What a bunch of bull.  Whether it's caught early or not, doesn't make the stats go up.  It definately is a good thing to have it caught early for prognosis reasons, but the # of women with BC has nothing to do with early detection.
The ACS doesn't tell you that 45% of all BC in women under 50 are missed with mammograms and 35% of women over 50 are missed.  They need to be alot more upfront NOW and not just after we're dx.
O.k.  I could go on and on because this is a subject that is my soap box..... sorry for rambling but you are so right.  After 30 years.....come on, where is the cure.
Nancy

							I agree.  The question is, how do we force the ACS to be upfront?  How do we jump up and down and where until someone listens?  This cloud is forever over our heads of if and when it will come back and to were.  I know me being stage III and ""young"" puts me high risk, but no stages are safe, that's for sure.  If you have any suggestions, I'm in there with you!!!!!

							Hi Friends,

I did read that the majority of women who get BC are over 50.  I think it said 80 percent, I'm not sure.  So...there are lots over 50 who are dying from this disease.  I believe the women who are in their thirties and forties tend to ""play"" on the computer more and visit the message boards and post.  

What really makes me angry is the way HRT has been passed out to women like candy.  And let's not forget the dangers of birth control pills and fertility drugs.  Messing with the hormones is nasty business.  Yet, they still infer that HRT is not that dangerous.  Well, maybe all the ""proof"" isn't there but in my mind it's very dangerous.

I hope everyone has a fun weekend.

							I If anyone out there knows, I would like to find out where to go, or whom to ask about needle biopsy...Especially the mammotone.  I recently had a mammogram that showed more calcium deposits, since last year.  My Gyn did a magnification, and told me I needed to go to a surgeon.  He made the appt, and after seeing this surgeon, I was discussing what kind of biopsy we were talking about.  I had a brochure of needle biopsies, and was wanting to have the most accurate one.  This surgeon informed me that my 34b breasts were ""TOO SMALL"" to fit the mammotone, and has set me up for the most drastic surgeries, of removing the entire lump, which is only 3/8 inches.  Does anyone out there know if breasts have to be a certain size in order to do a core biopsy??  I need some help, ASAP...If anyone knows the answer to this, I would appreciate a prompt reply, as this thing is scheduled for Jan 5th, next Wednesday, 2005.  I am thinking of calling the whole thing off and getting another opinion...Please, please HELP....Patricia P. Smith  aka Blondewildfire@aol.com, or Hotcouple12@aol.com  Thanks so much and good luck to all...Happy New Year!!

							Hi Patricia,
I sent you an e-mail.  Please don't cancel the appt.  The incisional biopsy is the most accurate way to go so there are no doubts.  Please e-mail me back if I can help.

							Here's a web site with information om Mammatome biopsies. Hope you find some useful information. I agree with Nancy, however, that an incisional biopsy is probaby the way to go. I've had two and gone home an hour or so later, so it is not too bad. Also had a mammatome biopsy, but surg. wanted to do incisional to make sure nothing was missed. It was still neg. for cancer. Good luck and please keep us posted on how you are doing. lauri

							I have opted for the excisional biopsy where they remove the entire lump...Given my family history, I called my cousin, a radiologist in Gulfport, Ms...He told me that since the lump was only 3/8 inches, that if I were HIS wife, he would want it OUT completely.  My 2nd opinion from another surgeon, said he HOPED we would get it all, and he would leave a wire in in case we didn't.  The key word here was HOPED...The first opinion was to remove the entire lump, and send it off..Not a guarantee that it won't be cancer, but seems more sensible to me, after talking to my cousin who has my best interest at heart...We are quite close...but thanks to all of you, that answered my questions..The only thing about the 1st surgeon, ladies, is that you CAN have a needle biopsy.  The 2nd opinion was that you stood up, placed your breasts in two holes and they did it like that...It is better if you are larger than I am in the breasts, but it is NOT IMPOSSIBLE like the 1st surgeon told me...However, at this point, I don't want to EVER have to go through this again...Granted if it is cancer and they didn't get it all after removing the lump, I will have more surgery...I will NOT have chemo though...That stuff is poison...Best of luck, and thanks for all the concern and help...I will keep you posted...Hugs...Patricia (Pat)

When my nephew (21) saw my pink ribbon magnet on my car, he asked where I got it.  He said he wanted to put one of his SUV.  I have to admit that shocked me.  I thought with him just turning 21 and hanging out with the guys, he'd get ragged about it by the ones that don't have a clue what it's for.  He told me I was far more important then what anyone said and if they said something, he'd tell them why he had it on his car, because his aunt was dx with BC and wanted to let people know how proud he was of me for going through everything I went through because he didn't want to lose me.  Talk about tears flowing.  He's had it on for about a week now and everyone of his friends of course who I know, know what it stood for, but even the ones that didn't know me, knew what it stood for because of family members or friend's family memories.  This disease has gotten so out of hand.

							Hi Lori. How do you know this is a ""gland"" under your breast that is inflammed? Do you mean it is a milk duct? What do you mean that your mammogram was ""unremarkable?"" Either it was normal or suspecious. No matter, if you have an unidentified mass, you need to call your doctor to get it checked out. If you have an ob/gyn, I would start there. Either that, or see your primary care physican. Please let us know what you find out. Happy New Year to you, too. Lauri

To clarify the mammagram was negitive.  I guess I don't know for sure if it is a gland or duct.  I have an appointment with my ob/gyn on Monday  and will post the results. TY

							Hi,
I'm glad you're going to the doc.  If this one says it's nothing, find another one.  Below is my bio of my BC.  My mammogram was ""normal"".  The only good lump is one in a jar and as far as family history, that only accounts for 10-15% of BC.  I was the 1st one in my family, 3 generations back is all we are sure of, but that's many years back.
Praying it's an infection or B9, just find out for sure for your sanity and God forbid it is cancer, better to find out now then down the road when it's had time to grow.
Keep up posted.

							I just had a Cat Scan on December 22, 2004, for a lump on or near rt. Parotid Gland. I have not received results back yet due to the holidays and there is no sense of urgency, just caution. However, the lump is approximately 2 cm+at surface and since the original exam I have found another lump or two near my carotid artery same side. I have also noticed a swelling or lump at my left ankle. Of course this is on my mind so I am trying not to make too much of it until the Cat results are in. The question is, should I bring these other areas to the attention of my doctor? She immediately scheduled the CAT Scan when she saw the jaw lump, without ever touching my face. Will the Cat provide enough information without my mentioning the other sites? Please advise. I am the type of patient who had rather be taken seriously, rather than run to my doctor with every minor complaint. Thanks for your time.

Thanks. The mental picture I have of ""cancerization of lobules"" is that the type of cells that normally line the ducts and have become DCIS have ""spilled over"" into the lobules, as either they have outgrown the space available inside the ducts... or else maybe they are ductal lining cells that were at the edge of the lobules and are simply multiplying into the lobules...??? and so these are cells that are in some way distinguishable in appearance from those that normally line the lobules (as well as distinguishable from LCIS)...?

							That's one thing about this disease.  We know more then we wish we ever had to, but on the other hand, know very little.
I was dx ILC so I definately don't know alot about IDC besides the fact that it is the most ""common"" kind of BC.  I would think they couldn't call it DCIS if it had spilled over into the lobules.  Isn't DCIS incapulated?  I thought that is what in situ meant, but I could be very wrong so if it spilled over into the lobules, it would be IDC????????  Thank God for Leo because he can explain what it means and we can both learn.

							Hello

While it is an interesting question, these are all pathologist's terms that I often don't know what they mean. I'd have to call the pathologist and ask him what that exactly means. But by definition LCIS is in situ i.e. *no* invasion of the ductal lining. 

What cancerization of lobules means is that a *ductal* cancer extended into the lobular area. That does not mean it is a lobular tumor, it is just the DCIS growing into the lobule. It is only a finding, and does not make it invasive.

I didn't want to get any more complicated than necessary, or confuse anyone. I just didn't understand why cancerization of lobules (COL) wasn't the same thing as what is called lobular cancer, since the lobules were ""cancerized""....

							Had a routine Blood Test done and Doc told me that ""my CEA Level""
was High. Told me I need to see a ""Oncologist"" because my
CEA Level is  11, and that  normal level @ max, for non-smoker 
is about 3, for heavy smokers around 5. He explained the significance
of a CEA level of ""11"" and it's connection to Cancer with a CEA Level
as elevated as mine.
Thing I'm confused about is, after docs saw my CEA level they of course
kept me in hospital. For 4 days they did tests, MRI, CT scan, Endoscopy etc..But found nothing on any of the imaging tests.
So, can anyone please tell me what that means! Do I have cancer some-where in my body due to the CEA @ level 11? Or do I not have cancer
due to the fact that all the ""Imaging Tests"" did not find anything?
And since a Level as high as 11 is usually an indication of advanced stages, how could it not show up in any of the ""Imaging Tests""?
						

"

							Hello

Elevated CEA may mean cancer, but it may mean a number of other things. For example: hepatitis, inflammatory bowel disease, obstructive lung disease can all cause elevated CEA. For this reason this test is not ordered to diagnose cancer, but only to be followed after cancer is diagnosed. For example, you start with a level of 15 due to colon cancer, once the tumor is out they check levels and follow them, since they are markers of recurrent disease.

							Hi everyone and happy new year. I go for my 4th A/C dose dense chemo treatment tomorrow and I still have my hair.  I started chemo on Nov. 22nd and have already had 3 treatments. My hair started to break off some a few weeks back and my husband gave a buzz cut. I still had a full head of hair but it was cut very short. Now, it is actually starting to grow. I asked the nurse practitioner at the onc. office about it and she had no explaination. She rubbed my scalped and said something about very strong hair follicles. Does anyone thing there is a correlation between not losing hair and chemo not working? I'm trying to not sound paranoid but everyone has said I would lose my hair within 5 to 21 days post 1st chemo and I am well beyound that. Anyone else not lose their hair on A/C?
On the plus side, I will be half way done with chemo after tomorrow, which I appreicate as I am having a hard time with nausea and fatigue.
Thanks for any input,

							Hi Jan,
I had 6 rounds of FEC and where most lose their hair around the 14th day, I still had mine after the 4th treatment.  The nurses got out the brochures, or whatever they are called and there was a very small % that didn't lose their hair.  My hair was thick and they thought I might actually not lose it............well, about 2 weeks after my 3rd round (I had FEC every 3 weeks) I went to brush my hair and it was definately coming out.  I had a few stray strands when it was all over, but definately had alot more scalp showing then anything else.  If your hair is thick, that may be why yours hasn't come out yet.  I was dx 2/14/02 so I'm coming up on 3 years and NED so don't think that the chemo isn't working.  I've heard a few were like us and late losers, but we did lose it before it was all over.  I don't think you still having your hair has anything to do with chemo not working, it's doing what it's suppose to and don't be surprised if in the next couple of weeks you start getting brush fulls of hair.

							Hi Jan,

Congrats on being half way done with  your chemo tomorrow!  It's not too early to start planning that post-chemo celebration party now. LOL

I did A/C every three weeks and I think that's a  little different than dose dense as far as losing your hair.  I'm not sure but I think I've heard ladies say that it is a slower process (to lose your hair) on dose dense.  As Nancy said, I'm sure it's working, especially if you are having nausea and fatigue.  I had lots of nausea on A/C.  More than one night I had ""the bucket"" next to the bed at night.  I thought I might not make it to the bathroom, but lucky me...I did make it to the bathroom.  Tell your doctor and maybe he'll suggest a different anti-nausea drug.

1.   Annual screening mammogram followed by a diagnostic ultrasound found a 1.2 cm irregular spiculated mass.   Mass was hypoechoic.
Bi_Rad was 5 (highly suggestive of malignancy, and to take action)
No lump could be detected by myself or my gynecologist.
2.   Surgical consultation:  Surgeon stated, as lump could not be felt, he would do a surgical excision of lump, preceded by wire localization.  He was adamant that a serious auto accident and signficant bruising etc. of breast in same vicinity as present suspicious area could have led to scarring.   Surgery scheduled for 1/5.    Is this the way to go?    Wouldn't a biopsy prior to surgery be a better plan?
3.   After path report, if malignancy invasive, then will return to surgery for sentinel node biopsy (perhaps he said axillary node biopsy, am unclear...........could it have been sentinel node??????   wouldn't the above lumpectomy rule that out as a procedure?
4.   Some place in the above sequence, he also mentioned dirty margins, and future surgeries.   Am unsure as to whether that would be before the lymph node biopsy????????   Or After????????/
5.   Then after all surgeries healed up, would follow with 6 weeks of radiation.    Guess this is the only part I am sure of, as I am sure radiation will be the last thing that occurs.    
Can anyone help me.   I am so confused.   I feel like wrong decisions have been made, or if not wrong, at least better ones could have been made.     I am hoping someone can help me
Thank you

							Roxanne, I'm sure Dr. Leo and others can provide you with better information but I was told by my surgeon that the surgical incision of the lump is more definitive than a biopsy.  According to him, depending on how many samples they take, whether they take them in the right area, get a good cross section, etc they may or may not get definitive results.  The surgery on the other hand is the most accurate.   They will take enough tissue around the lump to get good margins meaning there is enough clean area around the lump that does not have cancer cells.  They put a dye on it to test it I believe.  In my case I had the sentinel node biopsy done at the same time as the lumpectomy but I'm not sure its always done at the same time.  They use this information to determine if an axillary node biopsy is needed.  With the sentinel node biopsy they will inject a radioactive dye in the area of the lump to track where the cancer cells are most likely to go if it were spreading and then do a biopsy on the first node.  If the cancer has spread, then the axillary node biopsy is done.  In my case I had the sentinel node biopsy done at the same time as the lumpectomy where cancer had spread only to the first node.  Then two days later went back for the axillary biopsy on 14 nodes and found nothing else.    My experience has been that the lumpectomy and sentinel node biopsy is pretty easy to recover from, its the axillary node biopsy that is more difficult.  Perhaps others can give you additional information.

							Hi,
You asked Wouldn't a biopsy prior to surgery be a better plan  A biopsy is considered surgery even though you aren't completely put under, instead are given Versaid (or at least I was......the I don't give a *** shot).  Again, I'm speaking from what they did with me and I'm sure there are many variations.  I had an incisional biopsy and the surgeon removed the lump and tissue around it.  I later found out he actually did a lumpectomy.  Once it was confirmed that I had cancer, I opted for a mastectomy without a 2nd thought.  I wanted no chances that the cancer could be somewhere else in the breast too.  Had I not chosen a mastectomy, they would have gone back in to get ""clean margins"" which is where they remove more tissue around the area that has already been biopsied until they get tissue with no cancer cells in it.  I've heard of ladies having 3 done before clean margins were gotten, but quite often they get clean margins with the 2nd try.  They didn't do sentinal node biopsies when I was dx, or maybe because the size of the tumor, they expected to find node involvement.  They removed all (16) of my lymph nodes at the same time as my mastectomy and 9 were positive.  

I'm confused at how they are already planning a treatment plan when they don't know what they will find.  Alot of oncos give chemo to Stage I ladies routinely now to increase the chances of not having a reoccurence.  There is no logic to this disease and many are treating with chemo even if there is no node involvement and the tumors are small.  Of course as you can see in my case, that wasn't an option.  My mammogram missed a large tumor and I had alot of + nodes.

I started chemo about 4 weeks after my mastectomy and node disection so the time frame they are speaking of in regards to starting radiation sounds right.  Again, I would want to know what is found before talking treatment.  If they feel that the tumor is cancer, I would question why they aren't doing the sentinal node biopsy at the same time.  It seems like alot of surgeries to accomplish the same thing as a couple could take.  Obviously if they don't know or don't feel as certain as they can without a biopsy that it's cancer, then they wouldn't want to do a sentinal node biopsy.  From what I understand and I could be wrong on this since I didn't have one, they have to inject the dye into the nipple a day or 2 before surgery and if I'm right, that would explain not doing it the same day as the incisional biopsy.

I had my biopsy done and found out I had cancer on 2/14/02 and had the mastectomy/node disection on 2/21/02 so I got it over with as soon as possible, but if you aren't comfortable with what they are telling you, you can get a 2nd opinion and a couple of weeks isn't going to change the outcome.

I was told that mine was a cyst even though I could feel an egg shaped lump that just popped up.  They did an ultra sound and told me I had 2, 1 cm b9 cyst.  I knew what I felt was one thing, not 2 and my gut told me to go somewhere else, which I did and well, you know the rest of the story.  Listen to your gut, be your own advocate, use a doctor that you trust and don't settle for anything but the best treatment possible (and I'm not saying the doc you're talking about isn't giving you that).
Best of luck and let us know.
Hugs and prayers

							Hi Roxanne. Welcome to the board. Glad you found us at this tough time in your life. My surgeon removed as much of my tiny lump as he could during a biopsy, so I am not surprised that is what you are scheduled for. Wire guided is often done, according to the medical staff where I had my biopsies done.
What you are being told about treatment is dependent on the pathology report. IMHO it is all speculation at this point, so try not to go there, yet. Good luck on the fifth. My thoughts will be with you. Please let us know how things go and what you find out. We will be thrilled if it is benign, and will hold your hand if the news is not good. Try not to worry until you know you have something to worry about. Take care, Lauri

							Roxanne,

If you are not clear on what they are going to do, call and ask questions...the nurse is usually very happy to answer any questions you have.  ANd if you are still not comfortable, get a 2nd opinion.  That's what I did and I'm so glad that I did.  I actually ended up having the surgery the first surgeon recommended but with a different doctor.  It does take some time but it's well worth it.  I had my surgery about 1 month and 9 days after DX but that was partly due to the holidays.  And I'm so glad I got that 2nd opinion...I found that I felt much more comfortable after the 2nd opinion and was much more comfortable with the 2nd doctor.  I have never 2nd guessed or regretted my surgery and I feel that I got the best care available.

							Hi Roxanne,
I was just diagnosed in Sept. 04 after finding the lump myself.  I know how you feel right now.  It is very scary.  The only way I got through those first few weeks is by having 4 very close friends who have all had breast cancer surround me with their love and support.  So, even though we are not there with you in person, we can share with you what happen to us and maybe that will help you in some way.  Of course, every case is different.  This is what happened to me......once I found the lump, I went for a mammogram and ultrasound.  The lump didn't show up on the mammogram but it did show up on the ultrasound.  I went to see the surgeon who offered me either a lumpectomy or a needle biopsy.  I chose the lumpectomy.   I was given a shot of ""happy juice"" instead of going ""under"".  I was sent on my way after the surgeon told me that it just looked liked fibrosis and not to worry.  Boy was he wrong.  A few days later I was summoned to the surgeons office to hear the news.  He told me that I needed another lumpectomy since my margins were not clear and at the same time he would take some lymph nodes out.   He said that I would need radiation and possibly chemo if the nodes were involved.  Anyway, I went home and two days later I decided that I was not going to take any chances.  I am a Mom of 5 young kids.  I went back to see the surgeon and told him that I wanted a mastectomy.  Three days later I had a mastectomy and 19 lymph nodes removed.  I went to see the oncologist and because all my lymph nodes were clear and the BC was in the early stages and the fact that I had the mastectomy, I did not require any chemo or radiation.  I was put on tamoxifen.  Hang in there Roxanne.  Take some deep breaths and try to relax.  The waiting is the worst part.  Take care of yourself.

							Hello

Thanks for posting. Even before my answer you already realize how helpful the nice ladies we have here can be.

It is nice to try to find out as much as you can about your disease, but at this point I would advise you to try to take one step at a time. You do not even have an official diagnosis.

What happens is: if you have a palpable nodule, then it is easy to do a biopsy. In your case the nodule is not palpable, so they will do a wire localization and open biopsy. Then you wait for your path report. I would not go beyond this point. There are so many paths that one can take from here that are dependent on the pathology report.

Please visit our forums, and get as much information you can from our folks. Let me know how I can be of help as well !

							I have always been a person who felt a lot of internal discontent if I could not understand each of the details in the decision algorhithm.   In my case, I clearly do not understand all the details (the what ifs).   However, as my surgery is less than 36 hours a way, I guess its no longer important as to how the snb 'fits in'; whether it comes before or after the lumpectomy; or whether it is done at all.    Or, maybe..........and this is a big maybe............the 5% chance that perhaps no malignancy exists at all...will make all other steps irrelevant.
Thank you, one and all, for giving me the emotional support I seem to need right now.

							Update:
Yesterday, had wire localization prior to my Wide Local Excision.   The wire localization was a 'piece of cake'.  No pain whatsoever; not even for the local anesthesia (did not have any pre-sedation).  The Radiologist stated that patients tend to have more discomfort, but should not have 'pain', when the tumor is deeper than mine was.   All pain seems to relate to the amount of anesthetic used, and the amount of time prior to the procedure (took about 2 minutes before numbing occurred).  
I also had an opportunity to ask the radiologist at that time about sentinel node biopsies.    She said that SNB are done frequently, when a WLE is not only a lumpectomy, but the biopsy state.    (I don't know exactly how the procedure works, with the tumor gone, but it seems to be successful).
The surgeon used pre-emptive analgesia (state of the art technique?), so pain was minimal after surgery.   Only had one lortab when I came home, and since have had nothing.
So now, its just waiting for the path report.   Am crossing my fingers, and praying for a miracle (I believe in miracles.........)
Thank you again for the support you have provided on this forum.

							Madge ~ Here is something I got from www.imaginis.com which is an excellent site:


 FDA Approves MammoSite Internal Radiation Therapy as New Breast Cancer Treatment Option (dateline June 24, 2002) Format for Printing 

 The U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) has approved the MammoSite system to deliver internal beam radiation to breast cancer patients after the surgical removel of a breast lump (lumpectomy). Internal beam radiation, or brachytherapy, significantly reduces the amount of time required with standard external beam radiation and may cause fewer side effects. While the new treatment has not been found to be more effective than traditional radiation therapy, the FDA approval provides breast cancer patients with another, more convenient option and could reduce the number of women who have their entire breasts removed with mastectomy.

Internal beam radiation involves using radioactive ""seeds"" (called Iridium-192) to destroy remaining breast cancer cells after lumpectomy. With the MammoSite Radiation Therapy System, the physician inserts a special balloon catheter into the breast cavity (the cavity, or space in the breast, is created after tissue is removed during the lumpectomy). A hollow catheter is attached to the balloon, and during radiation therapy, the physician feeds a small radioactive seed through the catheter and into the balloon. The seed delivers radiation to the surrounding breast tissue Internal beam radiation may also used in other areas of the body, including the mouth, cervix, and prostate.

Because a lumpectomy involves removing only a breast lump and surrounding margin of normal breast tissue instead of the entire breast, it is possible that some cancer cells will not be removed during the surgery. Therefore, radiation therapy is necessary after lumpectomy to ensure that any remaining cancer cells are destroyed. Standard external beam radiation therapy has proven to be effective at preventing a recurrence of cancer after a mastectomy; however, the treatment can be inconvenient for women because it must be administered over a six to seven week period. With internal beam radiation therapy, treatment time is reduced to five days.

Since internal beam radiation involves exposing less breast tissue to radiation, fewer skin reactions (such as redness, rashes, or irritations) occur with the new treatment. Patients also tend to experience less irritation of healthy breast tissues. According to Proxima Therapeutics Inc., the maker of the Mammosite system, internal beam radiation may also be associated with less toxic effects, compared to standard external beam radiation therapy.

""While there are positive outcomes associated with lumpectomy followed by radiation treatment, 50 percent of eligible women with early stage breast cancer still opt for a mastectomy,"" said Dr. Robert Kuske, Principal Investigator of the MammoSite clinical trials, as quoted in a Proxima

Therapeutics news release. ""MammoSite could make it easier for more women to consider the choice of lumpectomy and provides physicians with an important new tool for the practice of breast conservation therapy.""

Despite the FDA approval, internal beam radiation therapy has not been proven to be more effective at destroying cancer cells or preventing a cancer recurrence than standard external beam radiation. Further clinical trials will likely compare the two treatments more closely. However, for women with small breast cancers, internal beam radiation is a new option that women can now discuss with their physicians. The new treatment may also attract those breast cancer patients who refuse to undergo standard radiation therapy.

Hopes this helps!

That means that the number to look at will be the 9000. Meaning after treatment this number will be the reference, since it will decrease if the treatment is working.

							Hello,

4 months ago I received an ASCUS Pap smear result. My doctor proceeded with a repeat Pap smear and HPV typing. The original smear was done with the conventional method, the repeat using ThinPrep. I now have and LSIL result with no detection of HPV.

Is there such a thing as a non-HPV LSIL? Why was the progression from ASCUS to LSIL so rapid? Is this precancer?

Thanks!
						

"
"


							Nadja,

There is such thing as LSIL without HPV. While HPV is implicated in most forms of intraepithelial lesions, it is not always present. There is a chance that your LSIL may recede and go away, but there is also a (less likely) chance of progressing to a more advanced lesion. Regardless of what happens, you will need careful monitoring by your doctor.

							Just in case anyone finds this now, ASCUS is atypical squamous cells of undetermined significance, it basically means that there are cells that could be LSIL but there arent enough cells with abnormalities or the abnormalities arent severe enough to diagnose as LSIL, which is why repeat paps are very common.

							Hello Dr leo;

A friend just walked in here at our drop in who is going to have surgery in March to remove a tumor. The doctor has done blood tests and X-rays, and has told him that he has a tumor that may be cancer.

Brian is a marginalized adult with no schooling, so the details he has given me or been told may be a bit sketchy.

Wouldn't a biopsy be done to determine if the tumor is cancerous? What else is useful to know....??? I am one of his primary support people...

Thanks,
Pastor Rich
						

"

							Pastor Rich,

I am assuming you are talking about a liver tumor ? Anyway, it usually is biopsied first. He needs to have a workup to determine if the tumor is primary or a metastatic tumor from somewhere else. Anyway, with this social background things are so much more difficult... I suspect he may also have problem with insurance and that also does not benefit him. 

But this is a patient that has a lot to go through. If he has liver cancer it is not good, because he needs a lot of care, surgery if possible.

regards,
Leo

							Hello Dr. Leo;

Yes, it is a liver tumor.

Fortunately, we live in Ontario Canada so our health care is world-class and provided through our tax system. So my friend will get good care...

The humor in this situation is that I went to university with his doctor, who wanted to become a gynocologist for the reason that most 20 year-old men want to become one.    I haven't seen him since 1973 but knew he was here in town somewhere.....

If my friend has had blood tests and X-rays, would the surgery that is scheduled for March be the normal plan to do a biopsy on the tumor that is removed then???

Thanks, rich
						

"
"


							Pastor Rich

Not knowing details about this case, in general the sooner we can get a biopsy result the better. Sometimes the tumor is just too deep for a percutaneous biopsy to be done. I am glad that the health system you guys have in place accomodates all. In summary, I would ask his doctor the reason why a tissue diagnosis is not obtained sooner. 2-3 months sounds like a long time in such a case, but I can not make any conclusions without knowing more.

I know that Arimidex can raise choloesterol, thanks to you checking on that for me.  I'm on 40mg of Zocor and will be rechecked in about a month.  Is there any cholesterol med that seems to work better when the REAL high tryglic.

							Hey !

Long time no see !

Anyway, generally speaking we do not have good drugs to control triglycerides. The drugs we have do work, at the cost of many side-effects. Drugs that I can cite are fibrates (gemfibrozil, fenobifrabte) and nicotinic acid derivatives (Niacor, Niaspan). Statins also do help, especially the more potent ones like atorvastatin (Lipitor) and rosuvastatin (Crestor). A big part of controlling high TG comes from the diet, weight reduction and exercise.

							You feel the ones that you listed would help more then zocor?  Exercise, o.k. I might have slacked off on that a ""little"" lol but my diet is everything boring and low fat, low cholesterol and low in taste.... lol  I have gained weight with chemo even though it's been 2 1/2 years since my last one and of course chemo putting me into menopause hasn't helped the weight.  I've lot about 6 of the 30+ I put on, but it seems to stall out there. I guess it's time to use the treadmill instead of it just taking up space... lol
I about feel out of my seat when he said my triglycerides were 620 when I had never had a problem before, but now I know Arimidex can make those number go up and up, that explains it.  
It seems like when you take one drug, there's another one you have to take to combat the side affects.  I take Arimidex to hopefully prevent a reoccurence, but it could cause my arterties to clog and have a heart attack.........AHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH
Yep, we need a cure yesterday.
Thanks Leo

							This is scary.  I looked up zocor to see if it caused heartburn because I've had to take Nexium especially since he upped me to 40mg.  I can't remember the exact wording, but one of the warnings was if you were taking anything to do with hormones (not sure if they meant HRT or like me Arimidex to kill them) and also caused certain tumors to grow, but didn't cause them to mutate.  I now I'm NED, thank God, but I'm going to quit taking this.  With my age and Stage III, I'm not taking any chances.  Do you read the warning the same as me?  Which one is the safest for BC ladies and the most effective?

							I'm talking to myself again and answering my own posts, you better hurry Leo........LOL
I talked to the pharm. at the Cancer Institute I go to and he said that in his opinion, Zocor is the least of the evils as far as side affects.  He said they all have risks, but I obviously need to get my levels down and when they did the studies on rats, there was no ammune system like people have.  He said that if I was his wife or sister, he would rather see me on zocor because the others have more risks and some even have a risk of causing cancer and once we have been dx, we're more prone to get another kind.
You agree or disagree?

							Hello

Sorry to hear about this. It is very good that you are in the final stages of pregnancy. If indeed this is a skin cancer and you need treatment for it, there is a chance that the doctors may consider delivering the baby sooner than usual. At this stage in the pregnancy your baby is already very well developed and should not have any problems. 

But that is a lot of ""ifs"", so please try to remain calm and be reassured that your baby will almost certainly be well.

							if the lesion is melanoma, the location of it is not that important for the safty of your baby. melanoma is usually treated by surgery followed by adjuvant treatment. physicians may try to find a sentinel node using radioactive material and that may affect the baby. the surgery itself (usually a local excision) is not too dangerous to the fetus. 
if radiation is indicated (usually not), then you should wait until the baby is delivered. 
what matters is the depth of invasion.
discuss with your physician about the diagnosis first, and must inform him/her about the pregnancy.

Subject: UPDATE FROM JOHNS HOPKINS HEALTH CENTER

 Johns Hopkins has recently sent this out in their newsletters. This
 information is being circulated at Walter Reed Army Medical Center.

 Dioxin Carcinogens cause cancer. Especially breast cancer. Don't freeze
 plastic water bottles with water in them as this also releases dioxin from
 the plastic. Dr. Edward Fujimoto from Castle hospital was on a TV program explaining this health hazard. (He is the manager of the Wellness Program at the hospital.) He was talking about dioxins and how bad they are for us.

 He said we should not heat our food in the microwave using plastic
 containers. This applies particularly to foods that contain fat. He said
 that the combination of fat, high heat and plastics releases dioxin into
 the food and ultimately into the cells of the body. Dioxins are
 carcinogens and highly toxic to the cells of our bodies. Instead, he
 recommends using glass, Corning Ware, or ceramic containers for heating  food. You get the same results, without the dioxin.

 So such things as TV dinners, instant Ramin and soups, etc., should be
 removed from the container and heated in something else. Paper isn't bad but you don't know what is in the paper. Just safer to use tempered glass, Corning Ware, etc.

 Remember when some of the fast food restaurants moved away from the foam  containers to paper? The dioxin problem is one of the reasons. To add to  this: Saran wrap placed over foods as they are nuked, with the high heat, actually drips poisonous toxins into the food, use paper towels instead.

Here's what was written about this purported Hopkins story - you can find the full story at  http://urbanlegends.about.com/librar...tic_dioxin.htm  and there are more links there if you want to look further.

""This widely circulated email ? actual an updated version of an earlier message dating from 2002 ? not only contains inaccurate information, it is falsely attributed to a Johns Hopkins University newsletter. No such information was ever issued by any department of the university. 

To combat the inaccuracies, Professor Rolf Halden of Johns Hopkins' Bloomberg School of Public Health addressed the email's opening allegation in a special news release: 

OC&PA: What do you make of this recent email warning that claims dioxins can be released by freezing water in plastic bottles? 

RH: No. This is an urban legend. Freezing actually works against the release of chemicals. Chemicals do not diffuse as readily in cold temperatures, which would limit chemical release if there were dioxins in plastic, and we don?t think there are. ""

							Am I being paranoid or is someone goofing up with me.  Resection was 11/3, was given the pamphlet on MammoSite, which sounded good to me, was told do it after first of year.  I finally called 2 times right before Xmas thinking to schedule things as I had not received the call he promised.  Last call I left I mentioned my primary doctor would be calling next so I did get a reply.  I saw radiologist/oncologist Mon and he said looks o.k. and surgeon would schedule placement.  Surgeon's office called today and said Feb 2.  I questioned this as pamphlet said it had to be done within 10 weeks of the lumpectomy(10  would be next week).  She acted like never heard of that and did not even know when I had had the lumpectomy.  I asked her to please mention this to doctor and she said she would but I am not betting on that.  So I am thinking am I getting set up too late and this is all for nothing or what.  I know he is good surgeon but the office routine needs a general overhaul.

							Thanks for the reply.  I am trying to just wait out the next 3 weeks, but keep having thoughts like it will be too healed to insert tube and then be back to the 6 week treatment.  I feel sure the nurse did not talk to Doctor as I asked, this would mean changing her schedule and she would not like that.  I am going to have to let him know I was very unhappy with lack of communication throughout all this (especially the call he told me he would make and didn't) and anxiety it has caused.  I am not usually an uptight person as have had 12 surgeries since 1995 but for some reason this has upset me.

							From my brief review of the literature, mammosites are still being researched.   They are not currently the standard of care.    Although, all the current findings indicate that it is equal to, if not superior to conservative radiation therapy.
as mamm. are currently still being researched, it is impt that strict research protocols are observed, one of which is that mamm.'s can be done 'up to' 10 weeks of the lumpectomy.   The lit. seems to indicate that the reason the 10 weeks is chosen, is that after that, the tumor bed is more difficult to ascertain.   And, it is imperative that the radiation reach each edge of the tumor bed.
Leo, with your computer capabilities, you are probably 'the' person to research this question more easily than I am.  I think as mamm. become more and more the 'state of the art/standard of care' these type of questions will become increasingly more evident.   Therefore, it would provide such a benefit if you could evaluate the current literature re: the 10 week s/p lumpectomy restriction.
Thank you
Roxanne
PS: wish I were in an area of the country where mamm. were available to me     You are lucky you are eligible for this treatment.   Good luck imadere with being able to follow-through with this treatment option.

							Roxil:  Under Proxima Therapeutics site you can search for where in your particular area MammoSites are being done.  It has to be a pretty small area though, but also saw a release that they are making a bigger balloom.

I do know they state the tube can be put in at time of lumpectomy/calcification removal.  But I would wonder how they would be sure margins were clear.  Radiologist showed me pictures of balloom insert, good ones that filled the cavity completely, and bad ones that had some area not filled.  In that case he said they would remove tube and wait awhile before reinserting  It just looks to me like that ""hole"" where calcifications were removed would heal through completely...just have to see what happens I guess.
						

"
"


							Hi imadare6
I'm with you: how would they know if margins were clear?   Although my surgeon, when I talked with him on phone, was absolutely positive when he took my tumor out, that the margins were clear..........
Guess if margins were not, they would have to start over.    Take balloon out, and wait till re-excision and try again?
I also agree with you that the 'hole' where tumor or calcifications were, would 'fill in' eventually.   My guess is that this process starts almost immediately, and probably has most of the 'glue stuff' in place for further regeneration at about the 10 week mark.  I know this happens with sentinel node biopsies.    The accuracy diminishes if you have the biopsy after the lumpectomy, even if only 2 weeks has gone by.   Not by a lot, but some. 
I hope you let me know what happens with you.   I am crossing my fingers and saying my prayers that it all works out the way you would like.

   I will look up the site you told me about.   I wonder, if my Radiologist could refer me to a place out of state?   My cancer was 1.2 cm dense at the widest point, so from that stand point, I think I am eligible.   I haven't had the sentinel node yet though, so will wait to hear the results from that.   I also won't get the full path report back until tomorrow, so......before I can even think of my future, need to hear what that report has to say.    I have to 'pace myself' .    I always want to jump ahead about 3-6 months into the future, and guess this cancer journey is not like that for anyone; at least not in the acute phase of the journey.   At this point, only know I have a 1.2 carcinoma which was in Right breast, 5 cm from nipple, and 1 c.m. deep.

							Think I finally have my answer.  While reading Proxima Therapeutics site about their MammoSite I noticed a ""contact us"" tab.  I clicked on it and sent message asking about problems after the 10 week period.  I forgot about it but then got a telephone call from a representative of the company yesterday.  She was very nice and told me the procedure would still be just as effective, the only problem would be if the area had closed so much the balloom could not be inserted.  So now I know and it is just a matter of crossing my fingers that I am still open enough.  How nice to get someone who actually pays a little attention to you. :P

							Hi...my mom was diagnosed with malignant melanoma one year ago.  The cancer has spread to her lymph nodes in her armpit ..they were removed.  Since then the cancer has spread to the liver and lungs.  Mom wasn't able to continue with interferon and has been going through chemotherapy.  At the end of the month she will be starting Interlukin 2..seems to be a new drug and I haven't been able to find a lot of information on it...and its success rates.  The doctors seem to feel like it is enevitable that the tumors will spread to her brain..the chemo hasn't changed the sizes of the tumors at all.  I am just wondering what to expect with this new drug and what the prognosis really is.  I also would like to know what the side effects of interlukin are and what i can do to best support her.

One more question...we were told that if the cancer spreads to her brain then they can do radiation.  Why is it that the brain can have radiation but her lungs and liver cannot?  Doesn't seem to make sense to me at all.

Thanks for posting. Interleukin 2 is not very new, but it has been used for melanoma. There are many side-effects, and you can find more information about the drug here
http://www.cancerbacup.org.uk/Treatm.../Interleukin-2

About the radiation, some areas are just too sensitive to radiate. The dose that needs to be given is high enough to cause permanent damage. The brain  cells do not divide often, so the radiation does not really affect them much, as opposed to the liver, GI tract, etc.

							Is it true that drinking alcohol will cause pain in effected areas if lymphoma exists? If so, is this true for any type of illness that effects the lymph nodes. I know when I was a kid, the pickle test was given if you had the mumps. This alone dates me because there was no vaccine for mumps when I was growing up and the adults would give the kid a pickle to see if they were really sick or just had a cold. The pickle test was excruciating if you really had the mumps and you could not fake it.

							I can't  see a reason why anyone diagnosed with any cancer and is fighting to save their body would abuse it....  but i can't see why a post started in 2005 was answered in 2008 either.

as a Hodgkin's patient that had pain with just one glass of wine, I can say that the information on this post is incorrect.  (getting your bad nodes hot really isn't going to make them hurt!)

the alcohol test (like the pickle test) really won't work, because it is considered very rare in Hodgkin patients that they have pain (much less than 35%).  

please use proper procedure in getting diagnosed (there is a reason why doctor's don't have pickle jars or bottles of jim beam sitting around for testing patients!)

							Hi, I'd be greatful for any information anyone can give me regarding the following:  I had a mamography on Friday, in fact I had three, very worrying but was told that the results would be sent to my doctor shortly.  The same afternoon my doctor phoned me and said that the milcocalcifications (I think that's what she said) have clustered in another part of my breast and that I will be allocated an appointment very soon for a biopsy.  I was in such a panic that I didn't even ask what type of biopsy.  
Can anyone who's already had a biopsy tell me how much tissue is usually removed and is it painful. 
Has anyone who's been in the same situation as me decided not to go through with a biopsy and if so do you have any regrets etc. 
Thank you in advance

							Hi Kaz,
I know how scary it is to hear you need a biopsy.  My mammogram came back ""normal"" even though I felt something that wasn't right.  Biopies aren't bad at all and I'm the President of the Whimp Club   My guess is it will be an incisional biopsy which is the kind you'd want as far as getting accurate results.  You aren't put under with general anesthesia.  I was given Versaid (The I don't give a **** shot) and one minute you're awake and the next min. you're awake and it's over.  They will remove the cluster and some tissue around it.  In my case they removed a good size area (3.5 cm) and I had a small incision.  I was sore, but it wasn't bad at all.
As far as not having it done and having regrets.  The only way you'll know if it's cancer or not is to have a biopsy.  If it's not, then you can relax and not worry about it, but if it is and you don't have it done, then the tumor will continue to grow.  I can't imagine how you couldn't have regrets by not having it done if it is cancer.  The earlier caught, the better prognosis.  You'll see my bio at the end of this.  Mine was advanced and it's been almost 3 years and I'm still doing good.  I had mine biopsied ASAP.  Trying to forget it exists isn't going to make it go away.
PLEASE get the biopsy.  We're literally talking about your life!!!!
Prayers and keep up posted.

I agree with the others.  Go get the biopsy!!!!!  The biopsy was no big deal at all!  I was just given ""happy juice"" to help me relax.  I never even had to take tylenol.  You need to know what is going on in there.  A biopsy is a good way to find this out.  You can't ignore this.  Early detection is so important!   We will all cross our fingers and toes for you that it will be nothing.

							Just adding another vote for a biopsy. Microcalcifications CAN be an indicator of breast cancer, but not necessarily. I had them under my lumpectomy incision 4 years after diagnosis, but the biopsy was negative for cancer. Good luck to you. Please keep us posted.

							Here is yet another vote for you to get the biopsy. 

I did end up not having a biopsy but it was because I had a surgeon who was a dope and recommended against biopsy... and the result for me was that the cancerous lump I had at the time, which was still small enough then not to require chemotherapy, grew...

By the time I finally talked the surgeon into doing a biopsy there were a total of 3 different radiologists all recommending biopsy, PLUS the surgeon also had done her own ultrasounds in her office (3 at the hospital, 2 in her office)... I have to HOPE that most surgeons are better than she is... I know the one I went to elsewhere for the actual surgery sure was wonderful.

I highly recommend getting the biopsy. Not only that, I personally would insist on an excisional biopsy.  

I'm wondering, though, if you are feeling so scared that it might be cancer that you are thinking you don't want to find out?

							I had a non palpable tumour that showed on normal 3 yrly mammo and was recalled to a specialist breast care centre in the UK. They showed me the mammo and the big shadow and that is when I knew it was cancer. Apparently cysts show up differently on mammos and ultrasound.
They did a compression mammo and ultrasound and immediately asked if I would have a core biopsy - heck, yes! I only felt a sharp prick as they put some local anaesthetic in the area. I don't know how much tissue they took out, but no scar at all, and it was certainly enough for the pathologist to determine I had invasive ductal cancer, as well as ductal carcinoma in situe (calcifications). I had a wide local excision with sample node ( removal and they removed the tumour and the DCIS. The tumour was 2 cm and 2 out of the 8 nodes positive so I had to go back for removal of the rest of the nodes, 1 more found positive. Thank God for mammos as no-one could feel the lump which was just below the nipple. I had chemo, radiation and now on Arimidex and feeling fine.  If I was you, I would insist on a biopsy as DCIS can turn into invasive and the quicker you get that stuff out the better. Good luck - my thoughts are with you. Liz.

							Thank you all for your replies, its certainly put my mind as ease.  I had a phone call this morning from my doctor's surgery to say that I will be having an appointment within the next few days to go for a Core Biopsy.  I have had mommograms for several years, six months ago I was told I had calcifications.  My last mammogram showed that there was a new area of calcifications, close to my chest wall and these are the ones that need further investigation.  

I find it strange that there is no treatment available to 'get rid' of these calcifications before they develop into something more sinister!!

My best friend died of BC and I have other friends/aquaintances who have BC, one friend in particular has had lots of problems and her health is poor from all the medication and chemo she's received.

I will keep you posted on the outcome of my results.

							Hi Kaz,
There is nothing that makes sense about this disease that's for sure.  I lost my best friend in Dec. and we were dx 1 day apart and both Stage III.  Mammogram missed both of our tumors that were 5.5 cm and hers was 9cm.  I'm so grateful that your mammogram picked up on the calcifications.  Obviously if mine had picked up my tumor, I wouldn't have been Stage III by the time I found it and had Kim's mammogram found hers before she found it, there's a good chance she would still be here and we wouldn't have already been Stage III.
Remember, this might not be cancer!!  I don't know anything about core biopsies since I had incisional, but if they can remove the cluster before it is cancer, then they have been able to do something before it turned into this horrible disease.  If it is BC, things and treatments improve all the time and since it was found early, chances are really good that you'll be 95 and helping others deal with it.
I asked my onco if there was any chance I could live to be a B**** old woman and his response was, as compared to a B**** young one......LOL  I think I created a monster when I told him to lighten up when things were going good.... lol

							Hi Kaz - just seen your posting - glad you are feeling happier about the biopsy. There is a way to ""get rid"" of malignant calcifications before they turn into invasive cancer and that is either a lumpectomy (or wide local excision) if the calcifications are clustered together - if they are widespread I fear it is a mastectomy. Either way, rather have it out than it turn into something that requires chemo and rads. 
Hope you will come back after your biopsy results with a benign result.
You will be in my prayers and thoughts.
Take care. Liz.

Very very common to develop some discomfort or numbness after breast surgery, especially if you had lymphnodes removed. As the ladies above mentioned, it's good that you are being seen.

							If my history still prints at the bottom of this message you can see why I might consider genetic testing. (There is also an aunt who died of ovarian cancer, not listed there.) 

As part of the clinical trial I am in I was given genetic counseling. If you are pondering whether to get genetic testing, it wouldn't hurt to seek genetic counseling. It gives you a much clearer focus after considering your particular history.

After receiving counseling, if my history had been stronger or if I had children I would have wanted testing. As it is, my sister already knows she is at high risk and is doing everything possible to be careful for herself so I am not being tested. The last I heard, testing was running around $2500 and some insurance covers it some do not.

							A tough question, Shelly. Since most breast cancers are NOT hereditary, I am not sure genetic testing should be considered routine.

I think I will invite my friend Sue who started FORCE to come and join in this discussion. I am sure she will have some interesting insights. Lauri

							Hi all,
I have had the bloodwork for genetic testing but our Canadian labs move slowly and I can't expect results for up to a year. The good news is that the cost is covered under our Canadian medicare system.
My choice to be tested was a family choice and recommended by my doctor due to history. I have a daughter, 3 sisters, and a brother who have all agreed that they would prefer to know so they will be better able to protect themselves, the nine vials of blood I had drawn for the testing was for them.
Wishing you all the best in whatever decision you choose.

My mother was diagnosed with BC at age 52...before menopause.  She has several cousins and 2 aunts that have had it.  My grandmother on my dad's side also had it.

I have a sister and 2 daughters.  My sister is currently doing everything she can to check for it because she is well aware of her risk.  My daughters are the ones I'm concerned with.  My oldest...18...was just put on birth control pills to help with cramps and that really scares me to death because both my mother's and my cancer are ER/PR+.  Then I think about this...if I have the tests done and then, when they get old enough, they do not want to know the results and do not want to be tested...I will know the results and I'll have to deal with it...because ultimately it's their decision whether they would want to know or not.

							Dear Friends,
Thanks to Lauri for the head's up about this great new forum!  FORCE: Facing Our Risk of Cancer is a national nonprofit organization devoted to individuals and families affected by hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.  Generally speaking, although most breast cancer is not hereditary, if there are certain red flags in the family, a hereditary component is more likely.  At FORCE we always recommend that women who are concerned about their hereditary risk see an expert in cancer genetics--that is a genetic counselor.  They will not try to persuade you either way but will give you up-to-date information (cancer genetics is a rapidly changing area) and help you make an informed decision.  You can find a genetic counselor near you through the National Society of Genetic Counselors website at:

http://www.nsgc.org

I also encourage you to visit FORCE if you would like to learn more about hereditary breast and ovarian cancer.  Particularly helpful is our brochure on genetic testing at:

http://www.facingourrisk.org/publica...rochure604.pdf

and our Resource guide with links to helpful and credible resources at:

http://www.facingourrisk.org/resources.php

And if you would like to talk with a community of women who have for the most part been through the genetic counseling and testing process then you might want to visit our message boards as well.

I hope this helps.  I'm always available if anyone would like to talk with me about my experiences.  I have a BRCA2 mutation (found out after diagnosis at age 33 with breast cancer) and also I'm founded and executive director of FORCE.

							Sue and all,

Thanks for visiting. When talking about genetic testing, people need to be counselled by a geneticist. Genetic testing can have a lot of consequences not only for patients but also for their families. Insurance can also be a problem, since all your medical records are usually released to insurance companies, so if you are a BRCA1 or 2 carrier, some insurance companies may refuse to cover you.

There are criteria for who should be tested, and only a geneticist can go over these with you. Anyone can get a genetics consultation, but testing is a whole different story.

							Hi all:

My mother has been battling lung cancer for about a year.  She endured radiation, chemo, and both at times.  The tumor was shrinking, and everything looked great (or at least as good as lung cancer can look)

1/3/05 was her last radiation treatment.  Everyone was looking towards good news.  Unfortunately, she started having headaches around Christmas, and on 1/6/05 was admitted to the hospital because she was very confused and disoriented.   We found she had metastatic lung cancer with several tumors on both sides of her brain.  The doctor prescribed heavy steroids and she has become less confused.  We go today to meet another oncologist, and start full brain radiation (if she will agree to more treatment).

After reading this forum, I see that my expectations for prognosis may be right on (weeks to months), but I would like to know from others if there is anything else I can expect.  Thank you very much for your time.

Sorry to hear what your mother is going through. Whole brain radiation and steroids are palliative options that may buy some time. It is impossible to predict when...but as you pointed out the prognosis is not very good.

							steriod and whole brain radiation can palliate the symtpoms of brain mets, but will not change the course of the disease too much. if your mother has no other lesions out of the brain (in remission otherwise) and the number of brain mets is less than 4. you should discuss with the treating radiation oncologist for stereotactic radiosurgery (gamma knife or x-knife). a recent study from RTOG showed patients with 4 or less brain mets from lung treated with whole brain and stereotactic radiosurgery have improved prognosis include survival. the study was a plenary paper in 2003 ASTRO (the annual meeting for radiation oncologists).

							My wife's results from her lumpectomy showed angiolymphatic invasion and perinueral invasion. They couldn't find a sentinal node and she didn't have the aux node dissection so they don't know the status of those. She's doing Chemo/Radiation/Tamoxifen anyway.

My question is:

Is there really a difference between the angiolymphatic/perinueral invasion and having positive nodes? They know that microscopic cancer cells have escaped the tumor into all of the above vessels, but isn't that what they're checking for in the lymph nodes?

For all intents and purposes, isn't this really the same?

I guess I feel that the invasion(s) are really being downplayed, when I do research that shows it to be a huge factor.

							Hello

Even though these are not the same as positive lymphnodes, they mean that the tumor is agressive and has gained access to the lymphatic and bloodstream. So it is definitely important that she gets the most aggressive therapy, and it seems that she is already getting that.

							I'm going to put my 2 cents in as a question........well 2 to be exact.... lol

Shouldn't the nodes be removed either before or after chemo?  I know some have chemo before surgery but they still had them removed.

Second question.  My pathology report showed unknown vascular invasion because my surgeon said that the blood vessels/veins or whatever they checked had no cancer cells in them, but I had 9+/16 nodes.  I was told that wasn't a good test and that just because they didn't see any, didn't mean it wasn't in my blood system.  Is there a chance that it was contained in my breast and nodes and didn't get into my blood stream?  I was treated aggressively because of the stage and my age and the nodes, but I've not read anyone else's path that didn't find it in the blood stream.

Not true in my case. I cannot understand why your friend's doctor said that. 
When my doctor and I decided a type of operation we decided on cryosurgery, and I told him I had seeds planted 11 years ago, he was glad that I told him that. I asked why and he said that I would have scar tissue that he would have to go around, but other than that, it was OK.  Three months after my operation, my PSA was .05.
With my cryosurgery, my doctor used 20 probes, that's what he said, that's hard to believe. As you probably know, with the probes they freeze and thaw the prostate.  I only had one whole poke in my stomach, I can imagine where other probes went.

							I had the fun experience of personally visiting the Hoover, Alabama headquarters of Blue Cross Blue Shield of Alabama.  The primary issue was what ""usual, reasoanble, and customary"" means, since I had found that not one of their preferred providers I used for surgery, oncology, and such charged or accepted the small amount that BCBS was offering.  I suppose I am a bit of a skeptic, but I got the distinct feeling that there is a distinct ""Catch 22"" scenario here, where they are the big guys, and they can make exactly whatever rules they see fit.

The net result was that the fine surgeon (part of BCBS PMD and PPO network) charged more than twice what BCBS was willing to pay, and I really am stuck for the difference.  This kind of difference is true of every specialist used, without exception.  The net result is that although I am nominally insured, the roughly $100,000 that this one cancer episode costs wil leave me with about $25,000 of bills left over.   Ouch.

So, exactly what does ""usual, reasonable, and customary"" mean with respect to BCBS?  The answer is ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.  It is whatever they declare it to be, and no more.  

They say that emotional state affects one's recovery, and right now I am not a happy camper.  Yeah, I know:  Deal with it.   Oh well...
						

"
"


							Usually doctors that work specifically with plans such as BC/BS have contracted ratese and even though they bill considerably higher (I suspect as a way to get insurance companies to pay more), they cannot bill the patient for the difference.

Perhaps this varies by plan, but you might want to check that out.
						

"
"


							freeio,
 I have to agree with mkelly.  I have BCBS of Michigan and the drs. do agree to certain rates in order to be a part of the program.  You should not be held accountable for the difference, the drs. should accept the lower, agreed upon amount.  All of my drs. billed agreat deal more than they actually received.  Look into this further before you pay those bills.
Wishing you luck.

							Hello all!

Wow, this board is moving right along..... It's been a week or so since I've been here...... Cathy's next chemo (4 of 6) is this coming Friday.

We were told point blank in our chemo and nutrition class that chemo patients should stay away from supplements and large intake of certain vitamins that are anti-oxidants.

The reason to stay away from supplements is simple: they are not regulated and there is no guarantee of what they contain or even how pure it is. In spite of the massive lobbying by the manufacturors, they may or may not be safe.

With vitamins, at high dosages some can interfere with the chemo. Why go to all the pain of having chemo and then counter the effects?

							Hi Cindy,

If you dont mind me asking, where do you purchase maitake mushrooms,  melatonin, and cat's claw? And what dosages are you taking them at.  There are many sites on the internet and im worried that i would be caught in the wrong hands.  I also wanted to know what do you use naturally to promote COX2 inhibitors, anti-angiogenisis, anti-tumor proliferation, anti-inflammation.  My mother was diagnosed with Cancer, im trying to find out as much as i can to help her.

This is just PART of what I take. I am almost too ashamed to list everything, it is so much. I pay attention to things that are natural, for the most part, COX2 inhibitors, anti-angiogenisis, anti-tumor proliferation, anti-inflammation, etc. There is a strong suspected connection between body inflammation and cancer. Inflammation is a natural response to tissue disruptions, in the body. It is when inflammation starts firing out of control that problems are caused. I seem to be getting carried away, here. I could go on and on. 

Some of the stuff I take:

curcumin, maitake mushrooms, astralgous, cat's claw, nettle, IP6 (with inositol hexaphosphate), green tea caps, ginger caps, oregano, parsley, cayenne pepper, rosemary, L-theanne, milk thistle, vit D, calcium, ibuprophen or demethicin 2-3 times, per week, B12, sea kelp, chelated boron, CLA, aloe vera, selenium (together with vit E), CQ10, melatonin, raw garlic (chop, let sit 15 min and swallow, with water. I do it at night and by morning, there is no odor), acetly L-cysteine, grapeseed extract, etc. I also eat red grapes, with seeds and eat the seeds. Also, I incorporate plenty of omega 3's into my diet. I very rarely eat meat, due to the anachodric acid it has, which fuels cancer. I love meat, but I mainly eat fish and veggies, with a little cheese (which also contains AA). Cancer loves glucose and at one time I was doing so well to keep glucose out of my diet (body also makes its own), but I fell off the ""eating well"" wagon and got out of control. I have regained my composure and have been good for 2 weeks. I also eat raw broccoli, red cabbage, tomatoes, brussel sprouts, etc. I just got an electric sprouter for Christmas and will begin sprouting lots of good stuff.

I could go on and on, but I think I written too much. Take care of you.

							Hi everybody,
It has been ages since I have been on this board.  I have also begun to reseach a more ""natural"" approach since my chemo ended two years ago.  I was wondering if anyone could tell me anything about shark oil's (omega 3's)or specifically ""Seabiotics"" ...has anyone heard of this product.  It is all about the inflamation in your body and this is supposed to be great for reducing inflamation along with tons of other benefits such as cholesterol, high blood pressure, diabetes.......the list goes on.
So does anybody have any experience with this???

							I have just been switched to aromasin after 2 and a half years on tamoxifen (for early bc). My oncologist said that the trials have looked at this protocol, rather than tamoxifen followed by arimidex, which is what I was expecting to get.
My question is - is there a disadvantage to aromasin, as I know it is the only one of the 3 aromatase inhibitors which is steroidal, and that the effects are supposedly ""irreversible"". (Which effects???)
Also, could you tell me about potential side-effects.....
Is there anyone else out there who has done a similar switch, or been taking aromasin from the start?

As far as I know, the answer whether Aromasin is superior to Arimidex is still in the air. They are all third-generation antiestrogen drugs. In a recent paper from MD Anderson they evaluated the data and mention that no one is clearly superior yet.

							Hi DrLeo - thanks for your reply above......
But do you know the answer to my original questions?

What are the ""irreversible"" effects of aromasin?

What does it signify that aromasin is the only ""steroidal"" aromatase inhibitor? (I have read that it should more accurately be called an aromatase inactivator)

If you could answer these questions I would be very grateful.

Thanks, 

Sam

							Sam

The irreversible means that it will bind irreversibly to the aromatase enzyme, meaning it can be more potent than other agents. The steroidal part is that it may have a slightly different mechanism of action, due to the fact that cross-resistance with the nonsteroidal AIs is minimal.

							Hi Leo, 
Thanks for your past patience with my questions. I am still pursuing answers to a symptom. Not interested in a definitive diagnosis, but still need to know how to ask the right questions. I was given CAT Scan the other day and mentioned this in past posts. There is a lump on my jaw of approximately 2cm+ The CT reported that the parotid glands were normal sized and no inflammation or other things seemed to be amiss. But! there is a palpable lump despite the Radiologist report saying there was nothing noted. I have a follow up with GP on this next Tues 1/18/2005. Since this is not considered a parotid problem, but there is a lump, Can melanoma, or other dangerous problems be possible, or is it likely I am chasing an ordinary piece of fatty tissue. I am not over weight and the lump has not always been there nor is there one like it on the left side of my face. What type of doctor would I see? My GP does not do any hands on work apparently. Would this problem go to a dermatology surgeon, or who? It does not appear to be a cyst of any sort. I have never had the first hint of Acne in my life. My skin is extremely fair and there are no apparent blemishes. I do not want to make more of this than is necessary but I also do not want to lose the side of my face to Cancer either. I had a younger sibling die of nonsmall cell squamous carcinoma of unknown primary origin. He was only 49. He started with a symptomless lump and 2 years later died. I don't want to panic over my lump but I guess you can see my conflict over whether to chase this, or ignore this.

This can be a lot of things. An enlarged lymphnode, a gland or a cyst. It can also be cancer, but it is impossible to determine. You definitely need to talk to your GP to see what he thinks. If he thinks it is worrysome enough that this should be biopsied, he will direct you to the right specialist.

							Has anyone had to deal with throat ulcers during or after chemo?  I just finished my last round of chemo a week ago.  Two days ago I started to develop mouth sores.  I have used Biotine toothpaste and mouthwash during the chemo and have never had problems with mouth sores until now.  But in addition to the mouth sores, now it feels like I have a sore throat and like something is lodged in my esophogus.  My first thought was of course, ""oh no another tumor"" but I'm thinking (hoping) now it might be throat ulcers since the mouth ulcers developed at about the same time.  I see throat ulcers are a side effect of the chemo and there is prescription medicine for it.  Anybody else had to deal with this and have any thoughts on what can be done?   The doctor is having me get a CAT scan tomorrow morning just to be sure nothing else is going on -- I think for my peace of mind more than anything else.

							Hi Marion,

When I was on A/C I did develop sore spots in my throat after each infusion.  It  lasted about ten days and always resolved itself.  It was a little weird - my entire throat was not sore (as usually is in a regular sore throat).  Rather, only a couple small spots hurt.  I remember because I used to complain to my DH.  I didn't bother to tell my doctor (probably should have) because it wasn't severe and  always resolved itself when my counts improved.

So....I think the chemo definitely does do a number on the throat, too.

It sounds like you have a great doctor checking all the bases.  Good luck and I hope you feel better soon (you will!).  Take it easy and try to pamper yourself a bit.

							Thanks, Margie.  Trying to think what might help to counter all the bacteria, toxins, etc after the chemo and help coat the throat (I had the A/C regimen also), I ate yogurt last night before bed.  By this morning my throat was better and almost cancelled the CT Scan feeling sure it was throat ulcers.  But I went anyway and the results were all normal.    As the doctor said, for the next 10 years, everytime something feels odd I will wonder and worry.     Thanks for your thoughts.  Now on to Phase II and radiation!

"

							Hi,

I don't know what research shows, but I think chemo can do a number on anything.

I called my dentist just before I started chemo and asked if they could squeeze me in with the next cancellation so I could get a good cleaning before starting chemo.  (They did, fortunately.) The dental hygienist instructed me on proper care during chemo. She said to brush at least twice a day and floss daily. In spite of  meticulously following her instructions, I went for a check-up after chemo when my counts returned to normal and discovered I had a low-grade gum infection.  The hygienist told me that normally my body would probably have been able to fight that off....but with the lower counts, it's more difficult.  

I was told the most we can do is lift our dental hygiene up a notch and then hope for the best.  But I definitely advise getting a dental exam after chemo (when your counts return to normal).

							What I had wondered about this was whether calcium depletion of the teeth was affected by chemo. My understanding of that question is that the teeth are already formed so low calcium isn't much of an issue. So... then why did the large teeth in the back fall apart immediately after chemo?

I breezed through the first two fills.   This last fill has made me really tight!  Not sure how much more will fit in.  I was a ""C"" before all of this and would like to remain a ""C"".  How many cc's did you do and what size did you end up being?

							Hey, Momof5!

Yes, they are going to remain rock hard, sorry!  But they have to be rigid - thier job is to push out and stretch your muscles, and it wouldn't work if they were nice and soft and smushy.  Makes sense, doesn't it?

I don't know how many cc's I ultimately got in my expander.  My doc expanded me to bigger than I would need to simply accomodate the new implant, so that there would be extra room, and the muscles could relax and contract around it and get the right shape around the silicone implant.  The silicone implant I got was 250 cc or a bit less, I can't remember.  I am 5""1', and am going to be a B, I hope a full B.  I used to be a not full, sort of draggy C.  He estimated the size to match my other boob, which is going to be uplifted - my old 51 year old boobs used to look good as a matched pair, but now the remaining one looks a bit saggy, especially when it's next to the new perky fake one. 

I am not the final size yet.  I am wearing a C, but that's the size that fits both my boobs most easily, and I am still a bit swollen.  For me, this is a long process.  But my scar looks good.  By the way, continue to put moisturizer/scar serum on the scar, it will make it look better, and soften it up.

It's ok that you are tight after a fillup, but if it hurts too much, he's overfilled you.  And you should tell him, so the next time he won't do that.   

It really is an amazing process, and I am so glad that I had it done.  Although the whole thing is not finished yet, I feel that the final result will be good, and that I will be able to go on about the rest of my life without feeling disfigured (or not too much, anyway!).

							Dear Participants

I just added RSS syndication to our forums. 

What is RSS ? It is an easy way to keep up with forums, weblogs, news and other constantly updated content from one central location. 

You will need an aggregator, which will be the central location of all your RSS feeds. You can use a software application like the free FeedReader (http://www.feedreader.com), or a very popular weebsite called Bloglines (http://bloglines.com). Both are really nice, and you can get all sorts of content so you don't have to spend hours visiting websites to figure out which ones have new items.

To add the RSS Feed to your aggregator, the link is commonly found associated with the small orange RSS graphic ( ). Just copy that link to your aggregator and you are in business.

							Hi Angelina,
Im so sorry about your loss.  When I was 13 years old I lost my mother suddenly, due to a heart attack.  She was only 39 years old.  I had a very difficult time coping as well.  We were very close.  I still get emotional talking about it now.  The pain you are feeling doesnt go away, but it does get easier with time. All I can tell you is try and keep your fathers memory alive.  Talk about him.  What he liked and didnt like.  What made him laugh. What silly quirks he had. Tell stories of special moments you shared with him.  By doing this, your father will always be with you.  
Hang in there Angelina.  Everyone deals with a loss differently.  You do what is right with you.  You will get through this.  Heather

							I am so sorry.  My mom died of Melanoma in Nov after 5 very difficult years of battling this horrible disease.  Although I wish everyday that she could be here with us, I thank the lord that she doesn't have to suffer any longer.  I dont know if you father had a long trying disease, but there came a point that my mom said that she had had enough....there is definitly something to be said about that.  She didnt want to have to deal with it anymore.  Yesterday would have been her 57 birthday.  I was hard, the holidays were torture and I think sometimes I could just curl up and sleep my days away.  But then I think of her and all the crazy things that she would be doing up in Heaven (assuming that there is a heaven) and it makes me smile.  And I talk to her.  I know if sounds crazy, but I do.  I say her Happy Birthday in the car yesterday - yes outloud!

THe most frustrating part of it all is that when people ask about it or did ask about it, they would all ways say ""Oh its just skin cancer she will be fine""  - I never want to go in the sun again.  

I also find myself with very little patientence and I feel angry alot.  Angry at everything.  And very short with my husband.  I dont know how to fix it yet.....I just have to apologize to him and say I am sorry, i dont know why am so angry.  I am looking into a support group, maybe talking about it with others who have been through the same will help.  I do have a good family support - my sister and I are very close and we talk about it frequently.

I hope that this helps a little - Hang in there, it does get easier.

							I'm very sorry to hear of you loss, only you can truly understand how you feel so I'll avoid the temptation to say I understand. However I do have some knowledge of the grieving process that may help to put your feelings into a framework. Grieving is a cycle which includes, shock, denial, anger, sadness and acceptance. 

When we loss someone very close to us this cycle sets about a process that helps us deal with our loss. There is no time scale on this, for one person a few months might be all that is needed to reach the point where they can accept the loss and be more comfortable. Others can become stuck in one of the areas, such as anger, denial or shock. Should this happen these people will often suffer long term depression or other neurosis. 

If you feel you cannot move on and that your grief is becoming disabling, you should consider profession help, however most people that have close family links find that a patient husband, wife or friend can make all the difference in just letting you talk about your feelings for as long as it takes for you to move through the various stages of grief. I hope this helps.

							I am very sorry for your loss.  Kind of like having the wind knocked out  of you I.
Grief is a normal and very natural reaction to all the meaningful losses throughout or life. We have been told, ""time takes care of things"", ""stay strong for the kids"" along with all the ones you can come up with as you think about it.
I am a therapist that help Dr. Jay and Dr. Leo and would be happy to speak to you at any time . When I see patients or do trainings I use the Grief Recovery Handbook by James and Friedman (HarperPerennial).  I would be pleased to help you.  Remember at sometime we can ALL use a helping hand.

							I am so sorry to read about your father.  My father died from melanoma of the brain and left ear in 1996.  He was continuesly having nose bleeds.  They just could  not seem to come up with a diagnosis.  He lived about 9 months after finding out.  It takes time to grieve.  I also just lost a sister on 6-11-05 to cancer of the lung and throughout the body.  I am still grieving.  Websites like this one help us vent some of how we are feeling.  Just keep typing and let people now what you are going through.  They will answer.  Also you could keep a small journal.  Write in it every day and just say how you are feeling on a daily basis.  This could help.  Good luck and god bless you.   I sometimes just start crying for no reason,   hope this gets easier.Doctor is helping with anxiety medication and sleep, but wish I new a good book for this.  When you loose a twin, you feel like you have lost half of yourself.   Take care.  Hang in there.............

							On most cancer message/discussion boards, one of the most common themes is that of ""chasing mets"" (metatasis). Cancer patients are chasing mets because of the wrong type of chemotherapeutic regimens for their type of cancer histology. But why do patients with histologically similar tumors respond differently to so-called ""standard"" drug treatments? That is one of the main problems associated with chemotherapy. Patient tumors with the same histology do not necessarily respond identically to the same agent or dose schedule of multiple agents.

Medical oncologists select a drug and must wait to see whether it is effective on a particular patient. Conventionally, oncologists rely on clinical trials in choosing chemotherapy regimens. But the statistical results of these population-based studies might not apply to an individual. And when patients develop metastatic cancer, it is often difficult to select an effective treatment because the tumor develops resistance to many drugs. For many cancers, especially after a relapse, more than one standard treatment exists.

A chemoresponse assay is a diagnostic test (not a treatment) to help measure the ""efficacy"" of cancer drugs. They cannot make the cancer drugs do better, it can only measure the ""best"" probability of successful drugs. This is in stark contrast to ""standard"" or ""empiric"" therapy (also called physician's choice therapy), in which chemotherapy for a specific patient is based on results from prior clinical studies.

Laboratory screening of samples from a patient's tumor (if available) can help select the appropriate treatment to administer, avoiding ineffective drugs and sparing patients the side effects normally associated with these agents. It can provide predictive information to help physicians choose between chemotherapy drugs, eliminate potentially ineffective drugs from treatment regimens and assist in the formulation of an optimal therapy choice for each patient. This can spare the patient from unnecessary toxicity associated with ineffective treatment and offers a better chance of tumor response resulting in progression-free and overall survival.

It would be highly desirable to know what drugs are effective against particular cancer cells before cytotoxic agents are systemcially administered into the body. Chemoresponse assays are clinically validated drug tests on living (fresh) specimens of cancer cells to determine the optimal combination of chemotherapy drugs. These assays are specifically tailored for each individual patient based on tumor tissue profiling, with no economic ties to outside healthcare organizations, and recommendations are made without financial or scientific prejudice.

Recommendations are designed scientifically for each individual patient. Various assays are performed on a tumor sample to measure drug activity (sensitivity and resistance). This will determine not only what drug or combinations of drugs will not effectively work, but which will be most effective for an ""individual's"" cancer. Then a treatment recommendation is developed through what is known as ""assay-directed"" therapy.

2nd, 3rd, even 4th line therapies (why?)

I often read on the boards about oncologists telling patients ""if this drug doesn't work, we'll try this drug."" And ""if that drug doesn't work, we'll try this drug."" In patients who have failed two, three or even four chemo drugs, why not give them the ""right"" drug or combinations the ""first"" time around?

In academic centers, patients are entered into clinical trials of square peg in a round hole therapy. This encourages the patient to receive 2nd, 3rd, and 4th line chemotherapy, regardless of the likelihood of meaningful benefit. The therapies are equivalent on a ""population"" basis, but not on an ""individual"" basis.

They continue to try and mate a notoriously heterogeneous disease into ""one-size-fits-all"" treatments. They predominately devote their clinical trial resources into trying to identify the best treatment for the ""average"" patient, in the face of evidence that this approach is non-productive.

According to NCI's official cancer information website on ""state of the art"" chemotherapy in recurrent or metastatic cancer, no data support the superiority of any particular regimen. There is no proven ""standard"" first line therapy which has been shown to be superior to the many other choices which exist.

The same situation exists in the setting of 2nd, 3rd, and 4th line therapy. Proven by the large number of patients who have progressive disease on 1st line therapy but who have good responses to 2nd or 3rd line therapy.

So it would appear that published reports of clinical trials provide precious little in the way of guidance. These patients patients should have received the ""correct"" treatment in the first line setting. This can be accomplished by individualizing cancer treatment based on testing the cancer biology.

							With respect to metastasis, it is literally a cancer that has moved. It may have mutated further (cancer is itself a mutation that occurs within a cell that was intended to look and function as a normal cell but somewhere along the line the genetic ""wiring"" got crossed and instead of simply dying as it should have done, it divided and produced offspring cells that shared the same mutation as the original parent cell) in some respects - often it becomes more resistant to therapy than the primary (original) tumor - but fundamentally, it remains the same tumor-type.

In other words, a rectal cancer in the lung remains rectal cancer. The cell has identifiable characteristics which usually allow the pathologist to determine its point of origin. In fact, sometimes in cancer, a primary tumor never is located but the metastatic cells can be identified as having come from a specific organ system because of the way they look and because they express certain molecules which can be identified chemically.

Therefore, the treatment for a breast cancer, for example, that has metastasized to a different part of the body generally is treated in a similar manner as if the tumor cells all were contained within the region of the breast.

However, from the viewpoint of assay-directed therapy, none of that matters because it doesn't necessarily treat all breast cancers with ""the"" breast cancer protocol or all rectal cancers with ""the"" rectal cancer protocol (even if there were only one - in fact, there are several protocols to choose from).

Instead, the whole point of functional tumor cell profiling is to determine, individually - that is, for each patient - precisely which drug or drugs is best able to kill that patient's own cancer cells - no matter which drug that happens to be and no matter what type of cancer it is.

If you visit the National Cancer Institute website, you'll see that for virtually all cancers, there is no single ""best"" regimen listed. Instead, you'll find that, for each cancer type, many drugs and drug combinations have been proven in clinical trails to produce about the same result among large groups of unselected patients.

However, looking at the individual patients within a clinical trial, all of whom have the same type and stage of cancer, some patients do not respond at all to a specific treatment while others respond very well and, even in some of the very difficult cancer types, some patients achieve long-term remissions and even cures.

What this suggests is, considering that there are many drug regimens which are equally-accepted by the NCI and by oncologists, these drugs regimens should not be administered blindly but rather each patient's cancer cells should be tested to determine which of the otherwise equally-acceptable drug regimen has the very best chance of benefiting that particular patient.

							A metastasis occurs when cancer cells dissociate from the original tumor and migrate via the blood stream to colonize distant organs. This is the main cause of cancer death. For a cell such as a cancer cell to migrate, it first must detach itself from neighboring cells and the intercellular material to which it is anchored. Before it can do this, it receives a signal from outside the cell. This signal takes the form of a substance called a growth factor, which, in addition to controlling movement, can activate a number of processes in the cell including division and differentiation.

The growth factor attaches to a receptor on the cell wall, initiating a sequence of changes in the cellular structure. The cell's internal skeleton - an assembly of densely-packed protein fibers - comes apart and the protein fibers then form thin threads on the outside of the cell membrane that push the cell away from its neighbors. In addition, a number of protein levels change: some get produced in higher quantities and some in less. 

To understand which proteins are modulated by the growth factor and the nature of the genetic mechanisms involved in cancer cell migration, a map is needed all of the genetic changes that take place in the cell after the growth factor signal is received. One family of proteins stands out. Tensins are proteins that stabilize the cell structure. The amounts of one family member rise dramatically while, at the same time, the levels of another drop. 

Despite a familial similarity, there is a significant difference between them. The protein that drops off has two arms: One arm attaches to the protein fibers forming the skeleton, and the other anchors itself to the cell membrane. This action is what stabilizes the cell's structure. The protein that increases, on the other hand, is made up of one short arm that only attaches to the anchor point on the cell membrane. Rather than structural support, this protein acts as a kind of plug, blocking the anchor point, and allowing the skeletal protein fibers to unravel into the threads that push the cells apart. The cell is then free to move, and, if it's a cancer cell, to metastasize to a new site in the body. 

In experiments with genetically engineered cells, scientists have showed that the growth factor directly influences levels of both proteins, and that these, in turn, control the cells' ability to migrate. Blocking production of the short tensin protein kept cells in their place, while overproduction of this protein plug increased their migration. 

Scientists at The Weizmann Institute of Science, Rehovot, Israel, carried out tests on tumor samples taken from around 300 patients with inflammatory breast cancer, a rare but swift and deadly form of the disease, which is associated with elevated growth factor levels. The scientists found a strong correlation between high growth factor activity and levels of the 'plug' protein. High levels of this protein, in turn, were associated with cancer metastasis to the lymph nodes -- the first station of migrating cancer cells as they spread to other parts of the body. 

In another experiment, the scientists examined the effects of drugs that block the growth factor receptors on the cell walls. In patients who received these drugs, the harmful 'plug' proteins had disappeared from the cancer cells. The mechanism can predict the development of metastasis and possibly how the cancer will respond to treatment. This discovery may, in the future, aid in the development of drugs to prevent or reduce the production of the unwanted protein, and thus prevent metastasis in breast or other cancers.

							In regards to what ""theoretical"" microscopic disease may be left behind, spontaneous remissions in cancer suggests that the body can heal itself. It seems like most apparently occur in just a few types of malignancies: malignant melanoma, renal cell cancer, low-grade non-Hodgkin's lymphoma, chronic lymphocytic leukaemia and neuroblastoma in children. However, spontaneous remissions do occur in vastly different other types of cancers.

The very existence of spontaneous remissions represents a threat to some in the cancer industry. But such anomalies can pave the way to a better understanding of the causes of cancer which can then lead to rational therapies. Historical observations of spontaneous remissions of breast cancer after the onset of menopause lead to approaches of hormonal treatment which is a mainstay of adjuvant and palliative therapy in breast cancer.

Regardless, spontaneous remissions represent an important clue as to how the body can defend itself against cancer. Researchers should think ""outside the box"" at this important phenomenon rather than see it as a threat to their conventional thinking and appreciate the insight it may provide to rational approaches to cancer treatment.

For some common cancers, it is not clear that early detection and treatment actually prolong patients' lives. Early detection may just mean patients spend a longer time knowing they have cancer, and yet die at the same time they would have died anyway if the tumor had been diagnosed later. A decision to forgo cancer screening can be a reasonable option.

And the mutagenic (changes in form) effects of the wrong chemo can start the chain of metastatic events. A chemo-induced gene mutation can happen when the original chemo received does not work. The cancer can either continue to grow or comes back. When it does this, the tumor acts more aggressively. The mutagenic effects of chemotherapy on a genetically-unstable tumor, drives the tumor into a state of more aggressive behavior. You may even might kill off a whole lot of cancer, only to cause a mutation in the remaining cancer, such that the remaining cancer behaves in a more aggressive fashion.

The cancer can either continue to grow or comes back. When it does this, the tumor acts more aggressively. The mutagenic effects of chemotherapy on a genetically-unstable tumor, drives the tumor into a state of more aggressive behavior. You may even might kill off a whole lot of cancer, only to cause a mutation in the remaining cancer, such that the remaining cancer behaves in a more aggressive fashion.

I would like to express what is a personal opinion about cancer in relation to this article. My opinion is that most people whose life expectancy declines during cancer, declines due to the slash, drug, burn treatment methods for cancer. When some one gets a cold, we tell them to take vitamin C, stay well hydrated and get extra rest. To build the immune system back. With Cancer, we take the weakened immune system and feed it chemicals, to make it weaker, burn not only cancerous tissue out of the body, but healthy tissue as well, setting up additional chances for infection, and we hinder the body in other self healing ways by surgical invasion, for diagnostic purposes. I don't think that any procedure that leaves the body weaker than it was before, can possibly cure. It makes no sense. It reminds me of the days when we put rubbing alcohol on a wound to protect us from infection. It burned like the dickens and dryed out the skin so badly, it took twice as long for the skin to heal as would have if it had been merely cleaned with running water.  Then we were told the pain was being caused by the germs dying!!. I am afraid, that until the medical industry comes up with immune system building techniques that improve the way the body fights disease, we will continue to kill more patients with cancer than are cured.

"


							I could not agree with you more. The body's immune system attacks and eliminates not only bacteria and other foreign substances but also cancer cells. A cancer cell is not a foreign cell; rather, it is a cell whose biologic function has been altered in such a way that it doesn't respond to the body's normal mechanisms for controlling cell growth and reproduction. The abnormal cells can continue to grow, resulting in cancer. Much of the body's protection against cancer is carried out directly by cells of the immune system rather than by antibodies circulating in the bloodstream. Cancer is more likely to occur in people who take drugs that suppress the immune system than in people with normal immune systems.
						

"
"


							We have produced an entire generation of investigators in clinical oncology who believe that the only valid form of clinical research is to perform well-designed, prospective, randomized trials in which patients are randomized to receive one empiric drug combination versus another empiric drug combination.

What passes for a successful experiment in clinical oncology? Henderson, et al, entered 3,100 breast cancer patients in a prospective, randomized study to compare cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin alone versus cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin plus Taxol (in the adjuvant, pre-metastatic setting). The results were microscopically positive, at best, and cannot begin to justify the enormous financial and human resources expended (while making no effort at all to test and improve methods to individualize treatment).

But these results changed the face of the adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer. Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin+Taxol became standard of care. Taxol recently went off patent. Now the thrust is to identify on-patent therapy which is microscopically better in clinical trials of one-size-fits-all treatment. Already, the community-based oncologists are migrating to Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin+Docetaxel (expensive/remunerative) so what was the purpose of doing that 3,100 patient prospective, randomized Henderson study?

Some academic oncology groups have as their major ovarian cancer project, clinical trials to show that Taxotere (Docetaxel) can now be the new ""standard"" therapy. Patients are treated with Taxol plus Carboplatin. If (or when) Taxol plus Carboplatin doesn't work, they'll be crossed over to Taxotere, a drug which is mostly (if not completely) cross resistant with Taxol, for which the cancer clinic will collect several thousand dollars per patient from the large pharmaceutical company if and when they are treated with this drug (delaying the patient's treatment and possibly subjecting them to a horrible death).

There were a couple of recent clinical trials, one dealt with breast cancer and the other dealt with lung cancer; both of them had the drug Taxotere (Docetaxel) in their repective studies. These kind of chemotherapy studies have never yielded any kind of meaningful advance. It's being done simply because Taxotere (Docetaxel) is an on-patent drug which has a Big Pharma sponsor willing to spread around a lot of money to identify and expand indications.

We are getting an expanding list of treatments which are partially effective in a minority of patients, ineffective in a majority, remarkably effective in a few, while being enormously expensive. The fastest way to improve things is to match treatment to the patient.

All the rigorous clinical trials identified are the best treatments for the average patient. But cancer is not an average disease. Cancer is far more heterogeneous in response to various individual drugs than are bacterial infections.

The tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. It requires individualized treatment based on testing the individual properties of each patient's cancer. There are over 100 different therapeutic drug regimens which any one or in combination can help cancer patients. The system is overloaded with drugs and underloaded with wisdom and expertise for using them.

In clinical trials, many patients are excluded because they could not complete the rather arduous treatment. So randomized comparisons are of healthier treated patients against all the controls, rendering a lot of trials invalid. All the rigorous clinical trials that have been identified are the ""best"" treatments for the ""average"" patient. This has been referred to as the lowest common denominator theory of cancer treatment. But cancer is not an ""average"" disease. Cancer is far more heterogeneous in response to various individual drugs than are bacterial infections. The present system exists to serve the clinical investigators and the clinical oncologists, but not to serve the best interests of the cancer patients. 

One of the main problems in providing effective chemotherapy is the situation that every patient is unique. Tumors grow and spread in different ways and their response to treatment depends on these characteristics. The amount of chemotherapy that each patient can tolerate varies considerably from patient to patient. Therapeutic protocols currently in use are limited in their effectiveness because they are based on the results of clinical trials conducted on a general patient population, yet no two patients are alike. 

Recent NCI data showed that U.S. cancer mortality rates have increased and age-adjusted cancer mortality rates in response to treatment have not improved in several decades, despite the introduction of many new drugs. There is a mind-set of cancer culture that pushes tens of thousands of physicians and scientists toward the goal of finding the tiniest improvements in treatment rather than genuine breakthroughs, that rewards academic achievement and publication over all else. Tumor shrinkage should not be the criteria for approving cancer drugs. 

A patient responds to therapy when their tumor shrinks, but apparently this has nothing to do with survival. A tumor responds, that is, shrinks a little, then quickly grows and spreads. The cancer comes back with a vengeance and the cancer patient is given a death sentence by his/her oncologist who will wash his hands of it. 

Experimenting on cancer patients is permissible behavior for medical oncologists. They have been allowed free access to their bodies with no accountability. After a cancer patient dies, there are no repercussions. The oncologist's compensation, reputation, position, career prospects and opportunities for advancement have no relationship to whether or not his patients live or die.
						

"
"


							The needed change in the ""war on cancer"" will not be on the types of drugs being developed, but on the understanding of the drugs we have. There are already over 100 different therapeutic drug regimens out there, and 400 are in the pipeline. Any one or combination of them can help cancer patients. The system is overloaded with drugs and under loaded with wisdom and expertise for using them.

There are many cancer drug regimens, all of which have approximately the same probability of working. The tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. Tumors grow and spread in different ways and their response to treatment depends on these unique characteristics. The amount of chemotherapy that each patient can tolerate varies considerably from patient to patient. It requires individualized treatment based on testing the individual properties of each patient's cancer.

Under this approach, scientists study how an individual's cancerous cells respond to drugs. Doctors have learned that even when the disease is the same type, different patients' tumors respond differently to chemotherapeutic drugs. More and more physicians and patients are turning to ""individualized therapies"" to treat cancers, not just ""targeted therapies."" Without individualized testing, it's difficult to determine which drugs are best for patients who don't respond to standard therapies.

Herceptin is only for the estimated 20% of breast cancer women at risk for recurrence. However, Gene Expression Assays are panels of markers that can predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence in various populations. By testing the gene expression markers of a patient, oncologists can identify those patients unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy from those that would, saving the other 80% of cancer patients the added expense, suffering and even death from having to take chemotherapy.

What a cancer patient would like ideally, is to know whether they would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. If so, which active drugs have the highest probability of working, which Chemotherapy Sensitivity and Resistance Assays can test for drug activity against a tumor, and what drugs are relatively non-toxic in a given patient , which Pharmacogenomic Testing can identify.

Whether a patient would benefit from adjuvant therapy depends on two things: (1) whether the tumor is ""destined"" to come back in the first place and (2) whether the tumor is sensitive to drugs which might be used to keep it from coming back.

The gene expression markers (assays) actually can be calibrated to provide information both about the possibility of recurrence and also chemosensitivity. The problem is dissecting one from the other. Studies to date have just looked at whether people had a recurrence.

You can identify gene expression patterns (via assays) which correlate with this. But it can be hard and even impossible to tell what exactly you are measuring: is it intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor? sensitivity to adriamycin? sensitivity to cyclophosphamide? sensitivity to taxol? sensitivity to tamoxifen? You find a gene expression panel which correlates with something, but picking apart the pieces is hard.

You can begin to do this if you combine gene expression studies with cell culture studies. Use the cell culture as the gold standard to define the difference between sensitivity and resistance. Then see which pattern correlates with which for individual tumors and individual drugs. It can theoretically be done (and certainly will be done, over time), but it's not easy.

And then you come to the 1,000 pound gorilla of a question: What effect will the different individual drugs have in combination in different, individual tumors? This is where cell culture assays will always be able to provide uniquely valuable information. But it's not one versus the other. The best thing is to combine these different tests in ways which make the most sense. One month's worth of herceptin + avastin costs $8000. That's without any docetaxel and blood cell growth factors and anti-emetics. If nothing else, we can't afford too much trial and error treatment.

							Her-2/neu 2+ Borderline 
Rec'd my path report yesterday. Its not complete yet, as I still need a SNB on 1/25, and need more studies on one of the lab markers, which leads to my question:  As the Her-2/neu is 2+ or borderline, another lab test called a FISH will be done. I am hoping that the positive Her-2/neu was an error, and this will be discovered when they do the FISH.  Is this very likely?   I am also Estrogen/Progesterone positive, and have heard, that if you are E/P positive, than more than likely you are not also Her-2/neu positive.   Has anyone else heard this? 
Does anyone have more information on this subject that I do? 
Also, if I am Her-2/neu Positive, than does that make it more likely that my cancer has spread to the axillary lymph nodes (I am 1.2 cm invasive ductal carcinoma, lumpectomy 1/5, Histology was Grade 2 (however, the Her-2/neu is not a part of the Histology Grading system). 
Thank you for any information you can give me.

							Hello

FISH will tell you if it's positive or not for HER2NEU. Usually tumors that are HER2NEU positive are more aggressive, so the likelihood of metastasis is higher. Also, ER/PR positive tumors are less likely to be HER2NEU positive, as far as I know.

If you are talking about breast lumps, benign nodules are usually stable in size, or grow very little. Benign nodules do not normally develop into a malignancy. Malignant nodules are usually malignant from the beginning.

							Hi. Tee, Dr. Leo has given you a good answer to your question. I would add that ANY lump needs to be checked by a doctor. A biopsy is the only sure way to tell if something is cancerous or not. Good luck. Hope you got the information you needed. Lauri

							totally agree. all lumps must be checked by your physician and a biopsy is usually needed to rule out malignancy.  usually mammogram can tell cancerous lesions if there is abnormal calcification too, but some cancer (invasive lobular carcinoma) are usually quiet on mammogram.

Dr. Lu is the specialist in cancer, but if you need to hear it from someone who has been dx and gone through all the treatments etc.  You couldn't have gotten better advice.  Do what you should do which is your annual check ups, including pap, pelvic and breast exam along with you self breast exams and discuss your concerns with you PCP or Gyn, whoever you go to for the annual check ups.  The only thing I would add is from someone who had their annual mammgrams starting at 39, with no family history at all of any kind of cancer, the self breast exams are extremely important.  My mammogram came out ""normal"" even though I ended up with a 5.5 cm tumor and 9+/16 nodes and Stage III.

							Hi, Flynn, and welcome. I see you are in Lithuania. My, we are getting to have a real international group here. I read Dr. Lu's response on the other board and think you got solid advice. I think the recommendation for mammography is usually 40, at least for a baseline. Breast self-exams are really important to do monthly so you get familiar with your own body. That way you are more likely to notice lumps, bumps or other changes. If you do not know how to do a self-exam, check the American Cancer Society's web site for more information. I agree with Nancy (Muttsmom) in saying that you should have an annual check up with your gynocologist or primary care physican for a clinical breast exam and PAP test as well as other routine tests. I hope this helps. Greetings from Minnesota. Lauri

A cancer cell is not a foreign cell; rather, it is a cell whose biologic function has been altered in such a way that it doesn't respond to the body's normal mechanisms for controlling cell growth and reproduction. The abnormal cells can continue to grow, resulting in cancer. Much of the body's protection against cancer is carried out directly by cells of the immune system rather than by antibodies circulating in the bloodstream. Cancer is more likely to occur in people who take drugs that suppress the immune system than in people with normal immune systems.

							We have produced an entire generation of investigators in clinical oncology who believe that the only valid form of clinical research is to perform well-designed, prospective, randomized trials in which patients are randomized to receive one empiric drug combination versus another empiric drug combination.

What passes for a successful experiment in clinical oncology? Henderson, et al, entered 3,100 breast cancer patients in a prospective, randomized study to compare cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin alone versus cyclophosphamide/doxorubicin plus Taxol (in the adjuvant, pre-metastatic setting). The results were microscopically positive, at best, and cannot begin to justify the enormous financial and human resources expended (while making no effort at all to test and improve methods to individualize treatment).

But these results changed the face of the adjuvant chemotherapy of breast cancer. Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin+Taxol became standard of care. Taxol recently went off patent. Now the thrust is to identify on-patent therapy which is microscopically better in clinical trials of one-size-fits-all treatment. Already, the community-based oncologists are migrating to Cyclophosphamide+Doxorubicin+Docetaxel (expensive/remunerative) so what was the purpose of doing that 3,100 patient prospective, randomized Henderson study?

Some academic oncology groups have as their major ovarian cancer project, clinical trials to show that Taxotere (Docetaxel) can now be the new ""standard"" therapy. Patients are treated with Taxol plus Carboplatin. If (or when) Taxol plus Carboplatin doesn't work, they'll be crossed over to Taxotere, a drug which is mostly (if not completely) cross resistant with Taxol, for which the cancer clinic will collect several thousand dollars per patient from the large pharmaceutical company if and when they are treated with this drug (delaying the patient's treatment and possibly subjecting them to a horrible death).

There were a couple of recent clinical trials, one dealt with breast cancer and the other dealt with lung cancer; both of them had the drug Taxotere (Docetaxel) in their repective studies. These kind of chemotherapy studies have never yielded any kind of meaningful advance. It's being done simply because Taxotere (Docetaxel) is an on-patent drug which has a Big Pharma sponsor willing to spread around a lot of money to identify and expand indications.

We are getting an expanding list of treatments which are partially effective in a minority of patients, ineffective in a majority, remarkably effective in a few, while being enormously expensive. The fastest way to improve things is to match treatment to the patient.

All the rigorous clinical trials identified are the best treatments for the average patient. But cancer is not an average disease. Cancer is far more heterogeneous in response to various individual drugs than are bacterial infections.

The tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. It requires individualized treatment based on testing the individual properties of each patient's cancer. There are over 100 different therapeutic drug regimens which any one or in combination can help cancer patients. The system is overloaded with drugs and underloaded with wisdom and expertise for using them.

In clinical trials, many patients are excluded because they could not complete the rather arduous treatment. So randomized comparisons are of healthier treated patients against all the controls, rendering a lot of trials invalid. All the rigorous clinical trials that have been identified are the ""best"" treatments for the ""average"" patient. This has been referred to as the lowest common denominator theory of cancer treatment. But cancer is not an ""average"" disease. Cancer is far more heterogeneous in response to various individual drugs than are bacterial infections. The present system exists to serve the clinical investigators and the clinical oncologists, but not to serve the best interests of the cancer patients. 

One of the main problems in providing effective chemotherapy is the situation that every patient is unique. Tumors grow and spread in different ways and their response to treatment depends on these characteristics. The amount of chemotherapy that each patient can tolerate varies considerably from patient to patient. Therapeutic protocols currently in use are limited in their effectiveness because they are based on the results of clinical trials conducted on a general patient population, yet no two patients are alike. 

Recent NCI data showed that U.S. cancer mortality rates have increased and age-adjusted cancer mortality rates in response to treatment have not improved in several decades, despite the introduction of many new drugs. There is a mind-set of cancer culture that pushes tens of thousands of physicians and scientists toward the goal of finding the tiniest improvements in treatment rather than genuine breakthroughs, that rewards academic achievement and publication over all else. Tumor shrinkage should not be the criteria for approving cancer drugs. 

A patient responds to therapy when their tumor shrinks, but apparently this has nothing to do with survival. A tumor responds, that is, shrinks a little, then quickly grows and spreads. The cancer comes back with a vengeance and the cancer patient is given a death sentence by his/her oncologist who will wash his hands of it. 

Experimenting on cancer patients is permissible behavior for medical oncologists. They have been allowed free access to their bodies with no accountability. After a cancer patient dies, there are no repercussions. The oncologist's compensation, reputation, position, career prospects and opportunities for advancement have no relationship to whether or not his patients live or die.

							The needed change in the ""war on cancer"" will not be on the types of drugs being developed, but on the understanding of the drugs we have. There are already over 100 different therapeutic drug regimens out there, and 400 are in the pipeline. Any one or combination of them can help cancer patients. The system is overloaded with drugs and under loaded with wisdom and expertise for using them.

There are many cancer drug regimens, all of which have approximately the same probability of working. The tumors of different patients have different responses to chemotherapy. Tumors grow and spread in different ways and their response to treatment depends on these unique characteristics. The amount of chemotherapy that each patient can tolerate varies considerably from patient to patient. It requires individualized treatment based on testing the individual properties of each patient's cancer.

Under this approach, scientists study how an individual's cancerous cells respond to drugs. Doctors have learned that even when the disease is the same type, different patients' tumors respond differently to chemotherapeutic drugs. More and more physicians and patients are turning to ""individualized therapies"" to treat cancers, not just ""targeted therapies."" Without individualized testing, it's difficult to determine which drugs are best for patients who don't respond to standard therapies.

Herceptin is only for the estimated 20% of breast cancer women at risk for recurrence. However, Gene Expression Assays are panels of markers that can predict the likelihood of cancer recurrence in various populations. By testing the gene expression markers of a patient, oncologists can identify those patients unlikely to benefit from chemotherapy from those that would, saving the other 80% of cancer patients the added expense, suffering and even death from having to take chemotherapy.

What a cancer patient would like ideally, is to know whether they would benefit from adjuvant chemotherapy. If so, which active drugs have the highest probability of working, which Chemotherapy Sensitivity and Resistance Assays can test for drug activity against a tumor, and what drugs are relatively non-toxic in a given patient , which Pharmacogenomic Testing can identify.

Whether a patient would benefit from adjuvant therapy depends on two things: (1) whether the tumor is ""destined"" to come back in the first place and (2) whether the tumor is sensitive to drugs which might be used to keep it from coming back.

The gene expression markers (assays) actually can be calibrated to provide information both about the possibility of recurrence and also chemosensitivity. The problem is dissecting one from the other. Studies to date have just looked at whether people had a recurrence.

You can identify gene expression patterns (via assays) which correlate with this. But it can be hard and even impossible to tell what exactly you are measuring: is it intrinsic aggressiveness of the tumor? sensitivity to adriamycin? sensitivity to cyclophosphamide? sensitivity to taxol? sensitivity to tamoxifen? You find a gene expression panel which correlates with something, but picking apart the pieces is hard.

You can begin to do this if you combine gene expression studies with cell culture studies. Use the cell culture as the gold standard to define the difference between sensitivity and resistance. Then see which pattern correlates with which for individual tumors and individual drugs. It can theoretically be done (and certainly will be done, over time), but it's not easy.

And then you come to the 1,000 pound gorilla of a question: What effect will the different individual drugs have in combination in different, individual tumors? This is where cell culture assays will always be able to provide uniquely valuable information. But it's not one versus the other. The best thing is to combine these different tests in ways which make the most sense. One month's worth of herceptin + avastin costs $8000. That's without any docetaxel and blood cell growth factors and anti-emetics. If nothing else, we can't afford too much trial and error treatment.

							Her-2/neu 2+ Borderline 
Rec'd my path report yesterday. Its not complete yet, as I still need a SNB on 1/25, and need more studies on one of the lab markers, which leads to my question:  As the Her-2/neu is 2+ or borderline, another lab test called a FISH will be done. I am hoping that the positive Her-2/neu was an error, and this will be discovered when they do the FISH.  Is this very likely?   I am also Estrogen/Progesterone positive, and have heard, that if you are E/P positive, than more than likely you are not also Her-2/neu positive.   Has anyone else heard this? 
Does anyone have more information on this subject that I do? 
Also, if I am Her-2/neu Positive, than does that make it more likely that my cancer has spread to the axillary lymph nodes (I am 1.2 cm invasive ductal carcinoma, lumpectomy 1/5, Histology was Grade 2 (however, the Her-2/neu is not a part of the Histology Grading system). 
Thank you for any information you can give me.

							Hello

FISH will tell you if it's positive or not for HER2NEU. Usually tumors that are HER2NEU positive are more aggressive, so the likelihood of metastasis is higher. Also, ER/PR positive tumors are less likely to be HER2NEU positive, as far as I know.

If you are talking about breast lumps, benign nodules are usually stable in size, or grow very little. Benign nodules do not normally develop into a malignancy. Malignant nodules are usually malignant from the beginning.

							Hi. Tee, Dr. Leo has given you a good answer to your question. I would add that ANY lump needs to be checked by a doctor. A biopsy is the only sure way to tell if something is cancerous or not. Good luck. Hope you got the information you needed. Lauri

I am very afraid of getting a breats cancer and though I am very young so far but still I visit  doctor regurarly just to make sure that everything is ok becaue my grandmother had a breats cancer and I have been taking contraceptive pills for 5 years now and I am not planning to have a kids.

Dr. Lu is the specialist in cancer, but if you need to hear it from someone who has been dx and gone through all the treatments etc.  You couldn't have gotten better advice.  Do what you should do which is your annual check ups, including pap, pelvic and breast exam along with you self breast exams and discuss your concerns with you PCP or Gyn, whoever you go to for the annual check ups.  The only thing I would add is from someone who had their annual mammgrams starting at 39, with no family history at all of any kind of cancer, the self breast exams are extremely important.  My mammogram came out ""normal"" even though I ended up with a 5.5 cm tumor and 9+/16 nodes and Stage III.

							Hi, Flynn, and welcome. I see you are in Lithuania. My, we are getting to have a real international group here. I read Dr. Lu's response on the other board and think you got solid advice. I think the recommendation for mammography is usually 40, at least for a baseline. Breast self-exams are really important to do monthly so you get familiar with your own body. That way you are more likely to notice lumps, bumps or other changes. If you do not know how to do a self-exam, check the American Cancer Society's web site for more information. I agree with Nancy (Muttsmom) in saying that you should have an annual check up with your gynocologist or primary care physican for a clinical breast exam and PAP test as well as other routine tests. I hope this helps. Greetings from Minnesota. Lauri

							The Associated Press reported that Cancer is the Top Killer for Those Under 85. There has been no real progress in the treatment of most common forms of cancer. Recent NCI data showed that U.S. cancer mortality rates have increased and age-adjusted cancer mortality rates in response to treatment have not improved in several decades, despite the introduction of many new drugs. There is a mind-set of cancer culture that pushes tens of thousands of physicians and scientists toward the goal of finding the tiniest improvements in treatment rather than genuine breakthroughs, that rewards academic achievement and publication over all else. Tumor shrinkage should not be the criteria for approving cancer drugs. 

The January 10, 2002 issue of the New England Journal of Medicine noted that 20 years of clinical trials yielded survival improvement of only 2 months for patients with advanced lung cancer. It also pointed out that oncologists at a single institution may obtain a 40-50% response rate (not cure) in a tightly controlled study, but when these same studies are administered in a real world setting, the response rates (not cure rates) decline to only 17-27%.

In the March 15, 2004 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, an editorial stated that a review of all the large, prospective, randomized trials published comparing the newer taxane-based regimens, none of these regimens have increased either complete response rates or overall survival, with median survivals remaining at two years or less. This is precisely the same results which were being obtained 30 years ago.

The results of nearly 30 years of clinical investigation in the treatment of patients with cancer, neither standard or high-dose regimens had done a great deal to improve the outcome of patients. For over the past 20 years, they relentlessly combined chemical agents in various regimens with ever-increasing dose intensity and the survival for patients is exactly the same, less than two years. Not a hint of significantly improved survival.

In the March 22, 2004 issue of Fortune, an extensive expose of why there has been no progress in drug treatment of cancer in three decades, the author writes that it is not localized tumors that kill people with cancer, it is the process of metastasis, 90% of the time. Aggressive cells spreading to the bones, liver, lungs, brain or other vital areas, that are wreaking havoc. You'd think cancer researchers would be bearing down on the intricate mechanisms of invasion and spread? However, according to a Fortune examination of NCI grants going back to 1972, less than 0.5% of study proposals focused primarily on metastasis, trying to understand its role in cancer or just the process itself. Of nearly 8,900 NCI grant proposals awarded in 2003, 92% didn't even mention the word metastasis.

So pharmaceutical companies don't concentrate on sloving the problem of metastasis (the thing that really kills people); they focus on devising drugs that shrink tumors (the thing that dosen't). There is a national problem in the way we treat the problem. It is time to set aside empiric ""one-size-fits-all"" treatment of cancer for ""individualized"" treatment based on testing the individual properties of each patient's cancer.

Perusing this article, by a cancer survivor himself, will enlighten one as to the accomplishments of cancer medicine over the last thirty years.

I would like to express what is a personal opinion about cancer in relation to this article. My opinion is that most people whose life expectancy declines during cancer, declines due to the slash, drug, burn treatment methods for cancer. When some one gets a cold, we tell them to take vitamin C, stay well hydrated and get extra rest. To build the immune system back. With Cancer, we take the weakened immune system and feed it chemicals, to make it weaker, burn not only cancerous tissue out of the body, but healthy tissue as well, setting up additional chances for infection, and we hinder the body in other self healing ways by surgical invasion, for diagnostic purposes. I don't think that any procedure that leaves the body weaker than it was before, can possibly cure. It makes no sense. It reminds me of the days when we put rubbing alcohol on a wound to protect us from infection. It burned like the dickens and dryed out the skin so badly, it took twice as long for the skin to heal as would have if it had been merely cleaned with running water.  Then we were told the pain was being caused by the germs dying!!. I am afraid, that until the medical industry comes up with immune system building techniques that improve the way the body fights disease, we will continue to kill more patients with cancer than are cured.

And then you come to the 1,000 pound gorilla of a question: What effect will the different individual drugs have in combination in different, individual tumors? This is where cell culture assays will always be able to provide uniquely valuable information. But it's not one versus the other. The best thing is to combine these different tests in ways which make the most sense. One month's worth of herceptin + avastin costs $8000. That's without any docetaxel and blood cell growth factors and anti-emetics. If nothing else, we can't afford too much trial and error treatment.

							Her-2/neu 2+ Borderline 
Rec'd my path report yesterday. Its not complete yet, as I still need a SNB on 1/25, and need more studies on one of the lab markers, which leads to my question:  As the Her-2/neu is 2+ or borderline, another lab test called a FISH will be done. I am hoping that the positive Her-2/neu was an error, and this will be discovered when they do the FISH.  Is this very likely?   I am also Estrogen/Progesterone positive, and have heard, that if you are E/P positive, than more than likely you are not also Her-2/neu positive.   Has anyone else heard this? 
Does anyone have more information on this subject that I do? 
Also, if I am Her-2/neu Positive, than does that make it more likely that my cancer has spread to the axillary lymph nodes (I am 1.2 cm invasive ductal carcinoma, lumpectomy 1/5, Histology was Grade 2 (however, the Her-2/neu is not a part of the Histology Grading system). 
Thank you for any information you can give me.

							Hello

FISH will tell you if it's positive or not for HER2NEU. Usually tumors that are HER2NEU positive are more aggressive, so the likelihood of metastasis is higher. Also, ER/PR positive tumors are less likely to be HER2NEU positive, as far as I know.

							Hi Everyone,

I'm just wondering how long it takes to administer the chemo.  I called in for my appointment today and they gave me a 3:45 appointment and I was thinking that there would not be enough time for everything.  I did receive a message when I got home this evening from the onco office to call them back so I'm thinking maybe they have figured that out and need to change the appointment.  Anyway I was just curious...

Also, I'm a big reader...should I take a book to read or will I not feel like it?

							Hi Shelly,
How long it takes to get chemo depends on what chemo you're getting.  I got FEC and got all 3 at the same time.  Some get AC and then Taxol or Taxotere, CMF etc.
I'd definately bring a book to read.  My onco's office had magazines, snacks, juices and all that good stuff but bringing a book will help the time pass.  I'm assuming that to start off each treatment, everyone gets the same which would be nausea meds and decadron (steroids) before they actually start giving the chemo.  Some chemos are drips and some have to be pushed and those the nurse will be right there with you and all the nurses that work for the cancer institute I go to were great and we'd just sit and talk about everything while they were giving the chemo.  Where I went, sadly, they were open to 7:00p.m. even with all the rooms they had for chemo, it was always full, so your appt. might be the time they gave.
I'm sure there are similiarities and differences depending on where you go, but the chairs I sat in were recliners and you could actually take a nap if you wanted to.
Good luck and you'll do great

							If I remember correctly my AC treatments took about 1-1/2 hours with premeds then the AC.  The taxol took much longer as they have to give it very slowly--I was there a good 4-5 hours each time.  It's good to drink a lot during the treatment and you can also snack if you like.  I always had someone bring me lunch during the taxol.  Reading is definitely a help to pass the time, although I always sat in the common room rather than a private one as I'm a people watcher, and many of the patients like to chat also.  Good luck!

							Hi Shelley,

When I had A/C, it was nearly 1/2 day long.

The infusion itself only took about 1 1/4 hours.  After the first time, I had them run it a little slower because I got a killer headache for 24 hours from it.

Everything else building up to it took a long time.  First, they took the blood to see if the counts were acceptable.  Then, wait for that result.  Then, onc. looks at the result.  Then, see onc. for 5-minute check.  Then I had a bunch of pills I had to take before the infusion.  Then I had to wait 30 minutes after taking them.  Very often, they were way behind and did not take me on time to start out.  So.....my point is    that everything else actually took a lot longer than the infusion.

You're gonna do fine!

							Hi, Shelley:  I agree with the others.  The A/C was only about 1 1/2 hours.  The bloodwork and waiting on the results prior to going to the chemo room takes about an hour.  I'd definately bring a book if you like reading or take a friend.  I had a different friend every time and it was a good chance to catch up on things.  I got my A/C in a recliner and they provided drinks, TV and blankets (you sometimes get cold as the IV drips into the veins).  You'll do fine and it will be over before you know it.

							This messge is for Dr. Leo,
  Dr. Leo, can you offer me any info on this?   I was dx with bc in 2001.  So far, all ct scans, PETS, etc have been negative. I feel good. However, since the last year and a half my tm's have been slowly rising. They started out at 16 and have now risen to 75 back in August of 2004.  I had ovarian cysts which are no longer there after my last pelvic US in November.  My  onc wants to repeat tm's in February. Could it possibly be the cysts which made them rise?  My onc said she will order a bone marrow test if they continue to rise.  I know other things cause them to go up, but they have steadily risen over the past year and a half and I have not had any infections etc for that long.  Any info on this please ???
Or anyone else on the board I would welcome info shared.
Thanks so much

							HI Jayne,
The way my onco explained it to me was that he was doing the CA 27-29 (started them 1 1/2 years after my original dx when he was as sure as he could be that I was NED) to keep an eye on them to see what was ""normal"" for me.  Mine have stayed between 8.95 and 12.75 and the last one went back down to 10.50.  He said if I was having problems and the markers were still well within the normal range, he'd take my problems, like bone pain over what the tumor markers said.  If the tumor markers kept going up over a period of time, he'd do testing even if I wasn't having problems.  In other words, he'll watch them, but won't depend on them, it's just something to watch.
I know the CEA can change if someone quits smoking, it's real sensitive and he's never done that on me.  There are reasons that your markers could be going up that have nothing to do with BC.  Your onco, in my opinion is being cautious and wanting to check things out since they are over 38.  I'm sure you're scared, I would be too, but from what I understand, they are more reliable if you have mets to see if the treatment they are doing is working, but not a guarentee.
I ""think"" that it's the white count that is involved if the bone marrow is.  Have your labs been normal?  When was your last PET Scan?  Mine doesn't do them routinely.  I have my labs done every 4 months and a chest x-ray once a year unless, like last year my hip was hurting and he did a bone scan.  Everything came out fine 
I know Feb. seems like forever, having to wait.  The waiting is always so hard.  Again, I've seen alot of ladies who's markers go up and are still NED after the CT's etc. are fun.  Praying yours will be the same results.  If you don't mind me asking, what stage were you?
Hugs and Prayers

							Hello

Tumor markers are tools that have to used cautiously. Like Nancy said, it is great to have a ""baseline"", so the optimal approach is to get one at the time of diagnosis, see what happens after surgery, then follow it. If they were high before treatment and became normal, great, you have a good marker of recurrence. Otherwise it's of no use. Your doctor is assuming your 16 was your baseline, and if it is rising it may be your breast cancer. But it can be other things as well. From a website:





			
				CA 27-29 levels can also be elevated by cancers of the colon, stomach, kidney, lung, ovary, pancreas, uterus, and liver. First trimester pregnancy, endometriosis, ovarian cysts, benign breast disease, kidney disease, and liver disease are noncancerous conditions that can also elevate CA 27-29 levels.
			
		

So there is no way to know what is causing its rise since you do not have one before treatment. But it is certainly worrysome that it is rising to these numbers. I am sure your oncologist is on top of it.

I am going through a tough time, as we are American but living in Germany due to hubby being in Air Force. So , all of this has been done so far with a German doctor with limited English speaking skills. When I asked my american dr if he had the translated results, he told me you have gastrointestinal carcinoid tumor of the appendix, you can look it up on the internet. At this time, I went to one website that didnt mention anything about it being cancer, just that if its removed everything should be fine just go for 3 month check up. My frustration is growing. But I finally have an appoinment next monday with an american oncologist. So hopefully we will finally get somewhere. My nurse read part of the translation to me and I have some questions for the oncologist, she told me that it said that it was MOSTLY removed from the wall!!! WHAT??? So does that mean I still have cancer/cells?? Looking for others who have gone through this or is going through this. Are you having a hard time getting anyone to listen?? I know its more of a rare cancer, but its still cancer and we need answers!!

							Dear Growla,

Sorry to hear that you have trouble consulting an English speaking physician. 

Carcinoid tumor of GI is not rare, although uncommon.  Because carcinoid is very slow growing, some physician may tell you it is benign.  However, since they may metastasize, carcinoid is considered malignant.

Surgery is the main treatment for carcinoid tumors.  Complete resection offers a good chance of cure.  One way to ensure complete resection (although not to guarantee it) is to check the pathology report and make sure that the resection margins are negative. So you may need to talk to the surgeon again to discuss about the pathology results.

Good luck,

Do you know the actual diagnosis for your sister's type of cancer? My mom also has a cancer of the appendix and she was specifically diagnosed with mucinous adenocarcinoma of the appendix. If this is what your sister has, there is information here (two pages):

http://cancerforums.net/viewtopic.php?t=1288

and here (four pages):

http://www.dipex.org/community/topic.asp?TOPIC_ID=93

I highly recommend that you talk to a specialist who treats this kind of cancer. There is a Dr. Paul H. Sugarbaker in Washington D.C. who you can contact  to get a referral to a doctor near you. His link is:

http://www.surgicaloncology.com/

My mother is being treated by a Dr. Robert Barone in San Diego, California, whom you could also contact to get more information if you want to. His link is:

							Tessa --
Don't give up hope!  You mention something about your sister living in a different country.  Check out a site called PMP Pals -- they have a database of doctors around the world who are experienced in treating PMP (which sounds like the disease your sister has).  Most oncologists do NOT know how to treat this, and sometimes do more harm than good.  If you'd like more information, google the term ""pseudomyxoma peritonei"" and start compiling information.  I also recommend a Yahoo group called PMP bellybuttons:

http://health.groups.yahoo.com/group/pmpbellybuttons/ 

You'll find all kinds of information there -- you have to search through all the messages, but still there is lots there that is helpful.

							Hi Drl Lu - welcome to the Board - I am sure lots of us bc survivors will have questions for you.
I was dx with invasive ductal cancer, 2 cm, 3/19+ nodes in Feb 03. I had a WLE then total axillary removal. 6 x FEC, 45 rads and 2 boosters. Now on Arimidex.
A few months ago I noticed a long lump in the top of the breast that had the tumour, which was below the nipple. Saw my GP who sent me to the Breast Care Centre on an urgent basis and I saw a surgeon, not the one who did my surgery. He sent me off for an ultrasound and the Radiologist said there were no tumours and that the lump was cording due to radiotherapy. As my original tumour was not palpable I have no way of knowing what a malignant tumour feels like. I had cording in my right arm after the axillary removal but have never heard of it in the breast itself. Have you come across this - just to put my mind at rest? I was discharged by the Oncology/Radiotherapy Dept in Feb 04 after completing my treatment with them. I have annual check-ups with my surgeon, next one due March 05. I would be pleased to hear your comments and whether or not I should seek further advice before March. I live in the Uk and really have no choice over who treats me on our socialised medical system. Many thanks, Liz.

							dear liz,

sorry i cannot give you a direct answer since that will need a physical examination and some tests (may need a biopsy too). 

i am not familiar with the word ""cording"" but i guess they meant fibrosis or scaring of the soft tissue, which is a commonly seen side effect from radiation and is always not cancerous. fibrosis is usually firm, and by simple palpation one cannot easily tell the difference between a tumor (malignant or not) vs. fibrosis.  although fibrosis is not uncommon, and i have seen many cases, it can be difficult to tell the difference. 

follow up with your surgeon is extremely important for you. if you have concern about the ""cording,"" ask him why he does not think this is recurrence, and if a biopsy is indicated.  unfortunately i cannot tell you what else you need to do over the internet, but you have already brought this to your physicians' attention and it should not be difficult for them to take care of your concern.

good luck,

let us know if you have further questions.

							Hi Liz,

I just saw my rad onc last week and I'll share my experience with you.  I hope it helps.

I have a lumpy area just above my scar.  He checked it out and said it is scar tissue.  He said there were various changes in the breast from the surgery, radiation and chemo.  Personally, I don't understand how chemo could change it.  Anyway, he claimed he could ""tell"" it was just scar tissue.  I expressed my concern telling him that when various doctors felt the original lump they assured me it felt like fibrous tissue and were, obviously, wrong.  The radiation oncologist said I should watch for changes and if there are any changes to call  him.  

I'm just sharing this so you won't drive yourself nuts with worry.  I understand how scary it can be.  BUT....you should definitely have it checked out asap.  You can't be too cautious as far as I'm concerned.  And if you feel you want a biopsy, push for one.  It's your body.

							Margie - thank you for your posting and sharing your experience. As Dr. Lu said, it probably is fibrosis. It's funny but I don't remember either the Radiologist or the Surgeon saying ""cording"", but my husband mentioned this expression to me some time after the consult and ultrasound. I only remember the surgeon saying that I shouldn't expect the breast to feel the same after I had chemo and radiation. I too wondered how chemo could make the breast tissue feel so radically different to my other breast.
This ""cording"" happened well over a year since I finished rx and that is why I am so concerned. If it was cording I would have expected it to occur sooner, as did the cording in my arm after axillary removal. As you can feel the lump easily, I don't understand how the radiologist could say in his report to the surgeon that he knew it was not another tumour. Perhaps fibrosis and tumours look different on ultrasound. I just wish I had had the presence of mind to question the surgeon further. It never occurred to me at the time to ask for a biopsy, but when I see my surgeon in March for an annual checkup I am going to do what Dr. Lu said and ask why he doesn't think this is a recurrence and if I am not satisfied with his answer, press for a biopsy.  
In the meantime I think I will make an appt with my local GP - he referred me to the surgeon when he felt this new lump but I never went back to see him after the ultrasound as I didn't think he could bring anything to the party. When he referred me he asked if I wanted to see the Oncologist or the Surgeon and I chose the surgeon because all the breast cancer machinery for diagnosis is in a specialist Breast Care Centre of Excellence, whereas chemo and radiotherapy are in an entirely different part of the hospital, quite a ways away, where many different forms of cancer are treated.  I think I now need to talk to the Oncologist because I have other problems, such as hip pain (GP said it is an inflamed bursa - what, for 3 months? Methinks not) and the recent blackout and unconsciousness. I am still dizzy when I get up from a sitting or laying down position. My gastro was surprised I had not been sent for a brain scan when I was taken into hospital after the blackout - all I got was an ecg for my heart which was fine. My GP can't order bone scans, CT's or MRI's - it has to go through what we call a Consultant at the hospital, but I guess he should be my first port of call now.
Thank you sincerely for your help and support.

							Hi Dr. Lu - thank you such an erudite reply to my ""cording"" question.
As I think I told you, I had an ultrasound at my last visit (some 3 months ago now) to the breast surgeon and radiologist. Can the radiologist tell from the ultrasound whether the palpable lump is fibrosis or a tumour?
The radiologist categorically said to me there was no tumour and he would write a report to the surgeon. This was all done very quickly, within an hour or so, and it was the surgeon who, apparently, said it was cording. They don't normally give you copies of any reports in the UK, but I would imagine the surgeon got this dx from the radiologist and felt that no further tests were necessary. Can fibrosis occur more than a year after radiation? Thank you for your time.

							Fro Dr. Lu,
thank you most sincerely for responding so quickly to my post about cording in my breast.
I do have another question that you may be able to help me with. I have had moderate to severe pain in my left hip for some months now. I saw my GP who did an alkaline phosphotase blood test which came back normal. He then sent me to a local ""cottage hospital"" for a simple x-ray of the hip, which he said was also normal. He diagnosed the pain as an inflamed bursa and gave me some anti-inflammatory cream, Phorpain which doesn't even touch the pain. The pain really is worse when lying in bed and disturbs my sleep, no matter whether I lie on a side, my back or stomach. Would an ordinary x-ray show if I had bone mets? He didn't mention anything about a CT or MRI scan. I will bring this up, along with the cording problem, with my original surgeon when I see him in March, but wonder if I need to go back to the GP and ask for further tests. I am concerned about mets as my breast cancer had spread to my lymph nodes before I was dx.  Although not within your field of rx, I had a blackout in October 04 which necessitated calling paramedics - I was unconscious for 30 or so minutes before they gave me oxygen. I was hospitalised overnight and had an ecg, but no eeg. My gastro thinks I may have had a mini stroke, but again I am worried about mets.
Many thanks, Liz.

							Hi Liz,
I know I'm not the doc you wanted to respond, but thought I'd share what I know until they get a chance to respond.
I had alot of pain in my hip which freaked me out, thinking the same thing, bone mets.  My onco did a bone scan which came back normal.  He then sent me for a bone density test since I am taking Arimidex.  The bone density test showed the beginning of osteop. (can't spell it so I won't try... ugh).  I'm now on actonel and it has all but stopped not only the hip pain, but the joint and bone pain caused by Arimidex.  If I remember correctly too, and I don't know if it's in all cases, but your calcium levels will be elevated if you have bone mets, or that's a sign to check furture.  How have your calcium levels been and have you had a bone density test done?  I'm 46 now and have been on Arimidex for almost 2 years.  Chemo put me into MENTALpause. 
A friend of mine had a bone scan done to check for mets and the onco ordered an x-ray of the specific area because the bone scan was inconclusive.  The x-ray showed normal and she was told, no bone mets based on the x-ray.  
I hope this helps some

							Hi Nancy - thanks so much for responding - I feel like such a hypochondriac at the moment, but having dealt with chronic Crohn's for some 34 yrs I know I am not imagining things. Perhaps it is Arimidex which I have been on for about a year now. My GP is very kind, but a tad clueless about breast cancer. I just want some answers. My biggest problem is that the hospital I go to don't do 3 monthly or even 6 monthly check ups and as I said previously I was discharged from Oncology after I finished chemo and rads. My GP would have to refer me back and he seems to think he can do these tiddly little tests that are neither nought nor something. I haven't had calcium tests because he said the alkaline phosphotase test would show if I had bone mets. I think the reason he sent me for just a normal x-ray of my hip was to look for osteoarthritis. I have been on steroids most of the last 34 years and I know they can cause serious bone loss. I had a bone density test about 3 yrs ago (ordered by my gastro) and this was normal. However, about 12 yrs ago I had my only other bone density test and this showed necrosis of the hips, so I just don't know who to believe. All I know is, I have severe pain at night in my hip joint when in bed. I am fine during the day except for the odd twinge.  Many thanks again for responding. I hope Dr. Lu may have some insight as to what I can do next.

I'm no doc, but when you said that it's worse in the a.m. and better later in the day, that is exactly what mine did and it was from the Arimidex.  Once I got moving, my feet and hip would ease up too.  
What would happen if you called your med. onco to make an appt.?  I'm still amazed that he released you after treatment, that just seems beyond crazy to me.  Even if I stay NED for 5 years, which I PRAY I do, I will still be seen by my onco once a year and more often if I need to.
It's been 3 years since your bone density test and you've been on Arimidex for a year, I'd definately have another one done.

alkaline phosphotase has to do with the liver.  Dr. Lu or Dr. Leo would know if a liver function test would have any relevence to bone mets, but I'm 99.9% sure that the alkaline Phos. shows how much activity is going on with the liver, or how hard it's having to work.  That can be elevated if you are taking a lot of meds, or it may have no affect on it.

I'm going to be watching out to see what the good docs have to say about this.  I think sometimes we know too much and other times, we don't know anything about this, if that makes sense.

							hi liz,
i cannot challange the finding of your GP since i have not see you or the x-ray. however, the x-ray is usually a choice to rule out bone mets. unfort the x-ray is not the most sensitive test for bone mets. usually bone scan is a lot more sensitive. thus to r/o bone mets, a bone scan could be used if indicated. x-ray is great to r/o lytic lesion when mets is severe.
ct does not provide more info than x ray usually, mri is good to see bone marrow infiltration. 
you can discuss with your GP or oncologist abt your concern and ask if a BS is indicated.
good luck,

							Dizzybuf38,

We found out 8 weeks ago that my wife has breast cancer.  She also has had Crohn's for the past 15 or more years.  From 2001 to 2003, she took Remicade (infusions) to help with the Crohn's.  We found a way in September 2003 to cure the Crohn's, but now the breast cancer has arrived...Hers also spread to the lymph nodes (9 of 1 but they did not find any cancer elsewhere (other than the 5.2cm tumor in the breast) so she is rated stage 3B.  She has already had a double mastectomy and had her first 2 rounds of chemo.

My question for you is this: did you also take Remicade for your Crohn's?  My wife's oncologist told us that she has several Remicade patients that now have cancer.

By the way, while my wife was on Remicade she had many episodes of what felt and seemed like Rheumatoid Arthritis - now that she is cured of the Crohn's, these Rheumatoid Arthritis symptoms are all gone.  She was also on 50 to 60mg of Prednisone for 6 years.

Thanks,

							Hey all, I also have had crohns and breast cancer.  Hip and back problems that coincided with my tomoxifen and arimidex use, a bit better since off of this.  Testing showed osteopenia, which  I just started taking actenol for, which I have delayed due to the fear of a flare with crohns disease.  My chrons has been in remission since my breast cancer treatment, the chemo seems to have helped greatly and now I am on a maintenance dose of imurane.  I did stop taking the imurane for a short while but my last colonoscopy showed some active disease so back on the imurane.  My crohns have never been serious enough that I had to be on steroids and never on remicade.  But I will add that my daughter who is 29 is on remicade and has had many many flare ups with her crohns.  she also was on prednisone for a long time before remicade.  With this said, she also has had hip/back pain for a few years now which all studies show are related to her crohns disease, both our GI's have attributed skeletal problems, especially the hip and back to the crohns and the meds.  Her GI is with the university of chicago and was one of the docs who was in on the original study/trials with remicade The remicade does control her hip/back pain as well as her crohns.  I will have to have her discuss with him as to the added risk of breast cancer, and any long term followup on the studies.  If I remember correctly there are quite a few women on this board that also have crohns disease, but I do not believe that many of them were on remicade.that was actually a discussion many of us had originally on this board.  Interesting..... good luck to all!

							I finally saw my bc surgeon 3 weeks ago and he had a bone scan done which showed arthritis in both hips, hands and feet - sweet relief that it was not bone mets. I am taking alendronic acid (which I think is a bisphosphotase) to prevent osteoporosis as I am taking Arimidex and have taken steroids for over 30 yrs. 

I never took Remicade for Crohn's because my Gastro said my psoriasis would be bad at the infusion site. I have been on oral methotrexate for about 5 yrs now (had to stop it when having FEC chemo for bc) and this week going onto weekly injections as we do not know how much mtx I am absorbing by the oral method. 

Feeling pretty good, just want the Crohn's problems sorted.
Thanks for all your responses.
Liz.

							I found a lump on the right side of my vulva.  I found it 6 weeks ago and had it checked by my gyn.  At that time, they put me on antibiotics and said to return if it didn't go away in 4 weeks.  I returned 4 weeks later with no changes to the lump.  At that time they examined me and said it could be a lymph node and to come back if it wasn't gone it 2 weeks.  It is still there and I set up an appt. for next week.  I am 34 years old and had a hysterectomy 3 years ago.  The lump is not on the suface of the tissue.  It is deeper and the gyn said they would have to remove it under gen anes.  Has anyone ever heard of something like this.  SHould I be freaked out???  Thanks....

							vulvar cancer is not a common disease but there is such an entity. usually a biopsy is needed to confirm the diagnosis. a biopsy can be needle, core, or excisional.  if the malignancy is confirmed, the physician should consider treatment to the inguinal lymph nodes too in addition to local surgery.  i think your first step is to confirm the diagnosis with the gyn since the treatment of a malignant disease is very different from a benign cyst or tumor.

good luck,

Just wanted to see how Cathy was doing with her FEC.  Is she still having no problems or have the side affects besides the fatigue kicked in.  She shouldn't have but about 1/2 of them left to go?  How are you holding up Rich.
Komen has a new pin on the website.  It's a co-survivor pin.  It's the regular pink ribbon and then it's got a white ribbon bordering it too.  It's for all the caregivers that got us through this ""journey"".

Hi Nancy!

Just picked your message up!!!!!

Cathy is doing GREAT! Right now she is in bed and not going to church to avoid infection, but there has been no nausea. Her blood counts were SPECTACULAR, said the onc.

We are 2/3 done. Her veins are holding up not-to-bad, though the blanket heater at the hospital was on strike, and that made it difficult.

So, God is good!  In fact, very good!

Thanks for asking!

							Hi Rich,
I got your e-mail after I posted this.  I'm SO glad Cathy is still doing so well on the FEC.  I never had to take any shots to get my white or red counts back up either.  Mine would bottom out as expected, but then starting building themselves back up.  I can't remember which chemo, either the 5FU or cytoxin, I know I had to suck on ice cubes or drink water while they were giving it to me.... must have been the 5FU and thank God I never had mouth sores either.
One of my veins did get hard and you could feel it elevated, I guess the one they used the most, but all that went away after some time.
Let her know her Stage III ILC sister goes for my check up on Valentine's Day and if all goes well, it will be exactly 3 years since my dx.  I pray we stay on that NED train until a cure comes around.
Hugs to you both

Why was the PSA test done?? Were other tests performed? There is insufficient information.

Based upon the PSA alone, I would have to say that it is best to take action without delay.

But what action? One must make sure that there is not some other reason for the extreme PSA reading. For example, was the prostate under stress within the 24-48 hours before the test? Examples include but are not limited to ejaculation, a DRE (digital rectal examination) and/or infection or inflammation.

Is a biopsy scheduled? If so, it absolutely MUST be validated by further examination by a lab that specializes in pathological examination of prostate specimens. The biopsy result would be the foundation for any future course, so its accuracy must be assured. There are about 6-8 specialist labs in the USA.

Is the doctor a urologist, or a cancer specialist (oncologist)?

There is a number of tests that will help to construct a portrait of the biology of this case, but first and foremost the presence or absence of carcinoma must be confirmed.

Please post updated information, including age, general health, symptoms, any other test results.

							To answer your questions, my husband just turned 69.  He has not had a physical since he retired from the military in 1984.  I have seen signs of problems throughout our 14 years of marriage that indicated a problem, but he refused to see a doctor.

We saw an internist on Jan. 10, and the doctor did the first blood test on my husband.  There was no stress on the prostate that I know of prior to this blood test.  This doctor sent my husband to an urologist immediately upon receiving the results of the blood test (Jan. 14).  The urologist scoped the prostate and took another blood test.  This blood test showed that his PSA was more than the 2,000 that his first blood test showed.  The urologist set up an immediate appointment for him to scope the prostate and do a biopsy on Monday (Jan 17).  (The doctor gave up his day off to do this.)  The urologist sent my husband for a CT on his stomach and a bone density x-ray. We are to get all of the results from the CT, x-rays and biopsy on Tues. (Jan. 25).

My husband's general health is good.  The most he has had through the 14 years is bronchitis once, pnumonia once, and had a basal cell removed.  He had skin cancer when he was stationed in Hawaii back in the 70's, so he is very careful about any abnormoral growth on his body.

I hope this gives you the info you need to answer my original question.  I would like to know what PSA 2,000 or more compares to the info I've been getting where the PSA is measured as 2.0 to 4.0 nano what have you.  I know we have to do something in a hurry, and we are.  My feeling is, if there is a cancer, you cut it out and get rid of it and hopefully live a long healthy life after that.

Thank you.

**Yes, I understand that denial is often the case in these matters. In general, men simply do not want to think about any problems with their ""plumbing."" This is a potentially deadly error.

The lives of Sue Anne and her husband (what's his name?) have fundamentally changed. No matter what the future holds, PCa in some of its aspects will forever be part of it. There is no choice;  it is best to decide to deal with this devil as best one can and not look back.

My response to it is somewhat military: first, I want to know the strength and dispositions of my enemy. Second, I want to attack it with every weapon at my disposal. The patient, a retired military man, may understand this very well. 

Those weapons are chosen based upon the intelligence gathered in the testing and staging phase. This is not just important, it is *vital.* I have seen too many cases in just the year or so that I've had to deal with my own PCa where men stampeded into treatments that may not have been appropriate because they did not learn the biology of their disease. And -- this is important -- the disease is as different as there are the men who have it. IOW, what's right for me is not necessarily what's right for Sue Anne's husband.

It will not do to choose a treatment strategy until as much as possible is known about the enemy. So: while moving quickly is important, I believe that moving in the right direction is absolutely essential.

** What is meant by ""scoped?"" 

This blood test showed that his PSA was more than the 2,000 that his first blood test showed.  The urologist set up an immediate appointment for him to scope the prostate

**there's that word again...

A CT and nuclear bone scan (it that's what the latter was) are usually too insensitive to be of use in staging the case of a newly-diagnosed man. AIUI, this is something that urologists and naive oncologists resort to as a sort of ""mantra.""  However, considering the extreme PSA level reported, they may in this case provide useful information about possible metastases.

(snip)

I hope this gives you the info you need to answer my original question.  I would like to know what PSA 2,000 or more compares to the info I've been getting where the PSA is measured as 2.0 to 4.0 nano what have you.

**The cutpoint for maximum PSA was, until recently, 4.0 ng/dL. Lately, it has been recommended that 2.5 is more likely to produce good results in terms of survival. A PSA in excess of these levels is considered to be good cause for a biopsy. An excessive PSA in and of itself is *not* diagnostic of PCa. Only a biopsy, properly validated as stated in my previous post, will do that.

Moreover, we must not neglect clinical staging, which is dependent upon a DRE (digital rectal examination) that one hopes was performed by a competent medic. This would be expressed as, for example, ""T2c."" The medic is checking for hard spots on the prostate. What is the patient's stage??

I know we have to do something in a hurry, and we are.  

**As above, do something soon, but *do the right thing.* Take the time to learn the biology of the patient's particular disease. Once that is known, the most effective treatment choice can be chosen. Running off in all directions will likely do more harm than good.

My feeling is, if there is a cancer, you cut it out and get rid of it and hopefully live a long healthy life after that.

**One must hope that prostatectomy is the right choice. BUT there may be another, better, treatment choice. I must say again that learning the biology of this particular case is *absolutely essential.*

I am not a medic, just a (so far) survivor. I have studied this devil for many months, and will not stop until either I kill it, or it kills me. 

I cannot recommend , nay, beg too strongly that the site of the Prostate Cancer Research Institute be the first resort: http://prostate-cancer.org/index.html
then click on the ""Decision Aide"" link.

							Hi  

I recently had three moles removed.  Two from my arm and one from my back.  Very small dark moles.  Got the results from the biopsy today.  One mole on the arm was fine, the other one on the other side of the arm and my back came back as ""Precancerous""

My question to anyone who may know is how does one determine a mole to be ""Precancerous""??? does this mean exactly that both my moles had cancer cells in them???? does this also mean that the moles were melanomas??  My doctor didn't explain it to me well so that's why I'm here to find out.  He just said that the moles will not return and to not worry....well I am worried because  I don't understand the meaning of Precancerous and what this means for me in the future....I'd appreciate any feedback from anyone who knows.  Thanks.
						

"

							hi,
when we talk about moles, we usually think about melanoma. but to be sure about the diagnosis, you need to ask the physician the exact term used in the pathology report.
melanoma, basal cell carcinoma, and squamous cell carcinoma all have ""precancerous"" conditions associate with them. 
anyway, knowing it is precancerous is much better than knowing it is a malignant melanoma.

good luck,

let us know if you have further questions.

							Hi,It is a shame your physician didn't give you a better idea of what you;re abnormality is. Some moles have abnormal cells in them. They are not melanoma but over time can change. Who knows why but due to this possibility a dermatologist will want to do a wider excision to obtain clear margins of tissue around the mole, therefore removing any additional abnormal cells. Also it is diagnostic in telling the doctor how deep the abnormality may have grown.  It is good that your doctor did a punch biopsy to begin with. I have had several abnormal moles removed over the years with wider excisions after the initial biopsy. No melanomas,
My philosophy is: it is better to have it removed if there is any question. As with any cancer if that is what it is, the earlier it is caught and removed the better. Best of luck.

							Hi. I've had 3 freckles removed and all were ""precancerous"". The lab test will actually say something like ""moderate"" or ""moderate to severe"" and this means (as far as I understand) how close it was to a melanoma. Mine came back severe and I've had to have more of the area removed via very minor surgery. Your doc is right in that it won't come back but you should keep an eye on your skin very carefully. Do a full check while in the shower. As long as any suspicious mole is removed you'll be just fine.

							Patients with recurrent breast cancer, it is often difficult to select an effective treatment because the tumor develops resistance to many drugs. Currently, physicians select a drug and must wait about six months to see whether it is effective on a particular patient. For many cancers, especially after a relapse or when a particular treatment is ineffective, more than one standard treatment exists.

Chemosensitivity testing can help physicians predict whether a patient will respond to a specific drug, much like they test bacteria for sensitivity to antibiotics, called Bacterial Culture and Sensitivity Testing. Chemosensitivity testing is an attempt to do something similar for cancer; fresh samples of the patient's tumor from surgery or a biopsy are grown in test tubes and tested with various drugs. Drugs that are most effective in killing the cultured cells are recommended for treatment. It is highly desirable to know what drugs are effective against your particular cancer cells before highly-toxic agents are systemically administered to your body.

Assay-testing is based on a biological principle that when a drug is effective, it will induce apoptosis (cell death) in the cancer cell. If the cancer cell is resistant to a drug, apoptosis will not occur. Assay-testing for apoptosis will determine whether a drug kills the tumor. Chemosensitivity testing (assay-testing) can take the guesswork out of cancer treatment. Patients with refractory cancer and have very limited time left to live, six months can feel like an eternity when they may have to start a whole new course of treatment if the original treatment proves ineffective.

One approach to individualizing patient therapy is chemosensitivity testing. Chemosensitivity assay is a laboratory test that determines how effective specific chemotherapy agents are against an individual patient's cancer cells. Often, results are obtained before the patient begins treatment. This kind of testing can assist in individualizing cancer therapy by providing information about the likely response of an individual patient's tumor to proposed therapy. Chemosensitivity testing may have utility at the time of initial therapy, and in instances of severe drug hypersensitivity, failed therapy, recurrent disease, and metastatic disease, by providing assistance in selecting optimal chemotherapy regimens.

All available chemosensitivity assays are able to report drug ""resistance"" information. Resistance implies that when a patient's cancer cells are exposed to a particular chemotherapy agent in the laboratory, the cancer cells will continue to live and grow. Some chemosensitivity assays also are able to report drug ""sensitivity"" information. Sensitivity implies that when a patient's cancer cells are treated with a particular chemotherapy agent in the laboratory, that agent will kill the cancer cells or inhibit their proliferation.

The goal of all chemosensitivity tests is to determine the response of a patient's cancer cells to proposed chemotherapy agents. Knowing which chemotherapy agents the patient's cancer cells are resistant to is important. Then, these options can be eliminated, thereby avoiding the toxicity of ineffective agents. In addition, some chemosensitivity assays predict tumor cell sensitivity, or which agent would be most effective. Choosing the most effective agent can help patients to avoid the physical, emotional, and financial costs of failed therapy and experience an increased quality of life.

Fresh samples of the patient's tumor from surgery or a biopsy are grown in test tubes and tested with various drugs. Drugs that are most effective in killing the cultured cells are recommended for treatment. Chemosensitivity testing does have predictive value, especially in predicting what ""won't"" work. Patients who have been through several chemotherapy regimens and are running out of options might want to consider chemosensitivity testing. It might help you find the best option or save you from fruitless additional treatment. Today, chemosensitivity testing has progressed to the point where it is 85% - 90% effective.

Conventionally, oncologists rely on clinical trials in choosing chemotherapy regimens. But the statistical results of these population-based studies might not apply to an individual. For many cancers, especially after a relapse, more than one standard treatment exists. There is rarely a situation where you would get everyone to agree that there's only one form of therapy. Physicians select drugs based on their personal experience, possible side effects and the patient's condition, among other factors. The system is overloaded with drugs and underloaded with wisdom and expertise for using them.

Chemosensitivity testing might help you find the best option, or save you from fruitless additional treatment. Another situation where chemosensitivity testing might make particularly good sense is in rare cancers where there may not be enough experience or previous ideas of which drugs might be most effective.

Finally, there has been a veritable deluge of new approvals of cytotoxic drugs in recent years as the tortuous FDA process has been speeded and liberalized. In many cases a new drug has been approved on the basis of a single very very narrow indication. But these drugs may have many useful applications - and it's going to take years to find out. Chemosensitivity testing offers a way of seeing if any of these new drugs might apply to your specific cancer.

There have been over 40 publications in peer-reviewed medical literature showing correlations between cell-death assay test results and the results of clinical chemotherapy in more than 2,000 patients. In every single study, patients treated with drugs active in the assays had a higher response rate than the entire group of patients as a whole. In every single study, patients treated with drugs inactive in the assays had lower response rates than the entire group of patients. In every single study, patients treated with active drugs were much more likely to respond than patients treated with inactive drugs, with assay-active drugs being 7 to 9 times more likely to work than assay-inactive drugs. A large number of peer-review publications also reported that patients treated with assay-tested ""active"" drugs enjoyed significantly longer survival of cancer than patients with assay-tested ""negative"" drugs.

How May a Patient Arrange to Have Their Tumor or Leukemia Tested?

Both fluid and solid tumor (200mg or 10mm in size) specimens may be sent out via Federal Express or another overnight courier service for testing at one of more than a dozen labs around the country. Note that the choice of a lab is not a geographical consideration, but a technical consideration. All of the labs that are listed are experienced and capable of providing very useful information. However, the labs vary considerably with regard to technologies, approach to testing, what they try to achieve with the testing, and cost. These private laboratories have been offering these assays as a non-investigational, paid service to cancer patients, the average cost being about $2,000, in a situation where 20 different drugs and combinations are tested, at two drug concentrations in three different assay systems.

By investing a little time on the phone speaking with the lab directors, you should have enough knowledge to present the concept to the patient's own physician. At that point, the best thing is to ask the physician, as a courtesy to the patient, to speak on the phone with the director of the laboratory in which you are interested, so that everyone (patient, physician, and laboratory director) understand what is being considered, what is the rationale, and what are the data which support what is being considered.

Here is an extensive listing for some of the reputable laboratories providing cell culture testing. These labs will provide you and your physician with in depth information and research on the testing they provide:

The first laboratory provides a ""cell growth"" assay. The assay is excellent at identifying drugs most likely ""not"" to work (drug resistance). The assay is not as good at identifying drugs which are ""more likely"" to work (drug sensitivity) or to identify the disease-specific activity patterns of new targeted drugs. Used for drug de-selection and not for drug selection.

All the below laboratories provide a ""cell death"" assay. At one time, the goal of cancer treatment was to inhibit unregulated cell ""growth."" In the last twenty years, the goal is to induce cell ""death"" in order to successfully conquer concer. The much older ""cell-growth"" assays measure a drug's ability to inhibit cell ""growth"" and only succeeds in eliminating drugs that would ""not"" work for a patient (drug resistance). The more modern ""cell-death"" assays measure the ability of chemotherapy drugs to induce cell ""death"" (apoptosis) in a tumor biopsy from a patient (drug sensitivity). The assays are excellent at identifying drugs most likely ""not"" to work and identify drugs which are ""more likely"" to work.

The two laboratories below, in addition to providing a ""cell death"" assay, provide a functional profiling assay which is the only testing that involves direct visualization of the cancer cells at endpoint. This allows for accurate assessment of drug activity, discriminates tumor from non-tumor cells, and provides a permanent archival record, which improves quality, serves as control, and assesses dose response in vitro (includes newly-emergent drug combinations). These two assay labs have about the most extensive information about the technology with knowledge spanning decades, utilize functional tumor cell profiling. Besides identifying drugs most likely ""not"" to work (drug resistance) and identify drugs which are ""more likely"" to work (drug sensitivity), these assays can identify the disease-specific activity patterns of new targeted drugs.

							I've always wondered when there will be a way to see which chemo would work best on individual cancer cells, which would, in my opinion increase the survival rate.  I've never heard that there was such a test.  This is all new to me.  I know they have done it for infections, like bladder infections to see which antibiodic would work the best, but never heard about it regarding cancer cells.

							Patients with recurrent cancer, it is often difficult to select an effective treatment because the tumor develops resistance to many drugs. Currently, physicians select a drug and must wait about six months to see whether it is effective on a particular patient. For many cancers, especially after a relapse or when a particular treatment is ineffective, more than one standard treatment exists.

Conventionally, oncologists rely on clinical trials in choosing chemotherapy regimens. But the statistical results of these population-based studies might not apply to an individual. For many cancers, especially after a relapse, more than one standard treatment exists. There is rarely a situation where you would get everyone to agree that there's only one form of therapy. Physicians select drugs based on their personal experience, possible side effects and the patient's condition, among other factors. The system is overloaded with drugs and underloaded with wisdom and expertise for using them.

Apoptosis assay (assay-testing) is based on a biological principle that when a drug is effective, it will induce apoptosis (cell death) in the cancer cell. If the cancer cell is resistant to a drug, apoptosis will not occur. This kind of testing can help physicians predict whether a patient will respond to a specific drug, much like they test bacteria for sensitivity to antibiotics.

							I'm confused, but I stay that way.... lol
Are you saying there is a test out now that can tell oncos which chemo will work based on testing the cancer cells from people?
That's what I'm confused about.  I've never heard that kind of test existing, just that IF it did, it would definately reduce the amount of chemo someone gets, playing the process of elimination and of course, less side affects, like heart damage etc.  Are you saying that there is such a test now?

							This testing (cell-death endpoints) was available since the early 90's. In fact, a Dr. William Grace, a practicing oncologist and director of cancer research and chief of medical oncology at St. Vincent's Hospital and Medical Center (New York City) has been utilizing assay-testing since 1995. He believes it is unethical not to use chemosensitivity testing in his practice. It is a real credit to oncologists who utilize assay-testing in their management of their cancer patients, despite the fact that their use constrained their freedom to choose and doubtlessly reduced their incomes.

Because of recent re-awareness of this testing, even Yale School of Medicine is studying a technology called the Yale apoptosis assay in combination with another technology called the ChemoFX assay, which could double the response rate to existing drugs.

Let me refer you to the Human Tumor Assay Journal, for extensive information about this technology and the politics of cancer medicine.

I have been seeing your posts about news and articles related to chemosensitivity testing. I would like you to let us know if you are affiliated or in any way connected to the groups promoting this method. I am not saying that the method is good or bad, I am just asking for the reason you are bringing this to the this website and posting on multiple different areas. 

You also posted a link to a Tumor Assay Journal, which links to a physicians website that does this testing. This ""Journal"" seems to be a publication of Dr. Larry Weisenthal, who is owner of Oncotech, a company that performs all these chemosensitivity tests.

I just want people around here to get the best information.

							The best information is that it is known as the Human Tumor Assay Journal, which links to ""15"" websites for laboratories providing this testing. The Journal is a publication of Larry Weisenthal, M.D., Ph.D., who is owner of Weisenthal Cancer Group.

I've been an advocate for a number of cancer subjects over the last five years. HBO Therapy for radiation-induced necrosis, abolition of the Chemotherapy Drug Concession as well as encouraging the technology of  Individualized Therapy. 

A group of leading chemotherapy experts have been working to promote research and clinical application of cancer therapies tailored for each individual patient. Their approach is in stark contrast to standard or empiric therapy, in which chemotherapy for a specific patient is based on results from prior clinical studies. 

They advocate use of scientifically-proven class of chemosensitivity and resistance assays (CSRAs) that measure drug-induced cancer cell-death (apoptosis). I believe that patients should be afforded access to such technology as an alternative to the off-the-shelf ""best guess"" therapy typically administered.

The Chemotherapy Drug Concession was a shameless way to preserve a system which presented an impossible conflict of interest for both cancer centers and treating oncologists. It was a system in which there was a financial incentive to choose certain forms of chemotherapy over certain others and to administer ""infusion"" chemotherapy as opposed to providing other forms of patient care. Not the least of the problems is that this inherently corrupt system provided a strong disincentive to ""individualize"" or tailor therapy, based on laboratory testing, because such individualized treatment removes the oncologist's ""freedom to choose"" from between a large number of different possible drug regimens, with wildly differing profit margins. What was needed to be done was to remove the profit incentive from the choice of cancer treatments. Patients should receive what is best for them and not what is best for their oncologists. The new Medicare Reimbursement bill has started oncology onto that road.

If more people researched how and why their loved-one died after being treated by orthodox cancer therapies, then I believe there would be a movement to have more effective and less toxic treatments available, which oral-dose ""targeted"" chemotherapy has been doing. Oral chemotherapy does not need to be injected into the body. It can be taken at home. Many oral chemotherapies can be more effective than infusional chemotherapy. Many forms of oral chemotherapy cause fewer side effects than I.V. therapy.

New ""targeted,"" relatively non-toxic oral chemotherapy is based on a variety of biological mechanisms that essentially stop cancer from spreading. These therapies use drugs that block the growth and spread of cancer. They interefere with specific molecules involved in the process by which normal cells become cancer cells, and tumor growth. They are a new feature of quality cancer care and will replace, enhance or even make more effective therapies that are largely based on intravenous administration (infusion therapy).

Compared to infusional therapy, oral chemotherapy can make receiving cancer treatment more convenient for patients by allowing flexibility in taking medication without disrupting work or other activities. They can often result in less time spent in office-based oncology practices because of the absence of intravenous administration and its related side-effects. You are already taking drugs to kill cancer cells, why do you need to take drugs to reduce or eliminate the side effects of those drugs?

Targeted cancer therapies will give oncologists a better way to tailor cancer treatment. Treatments may be individualized based on the unique set of molecular targets produced by the patient's tumor, and these treatment advances will require ""individualizing"" treatment based on testing the individual properties of each patient's cancer. Chemosensitivity testing can improve patient survival in chemotherapy for cancer.

							Hello

While I agree with you about the Chemotherapy Drug Concession issue, I still can not agree with the chemosensitivity testing...yet. The (small amount of) data that is published about that is scarce; there are no prospective randomized trials. It is not about chemosensitivity per se, I say the same about any new form of treatment: unless there is convincing data about it I would not indicate it to any patient. The reasoning behind it is good, but there are many things that still need to be worked out. Also, I have looked around and found people saying that the American Society of Clinical Oncology is ""blocking"" discussion about chemosensitivity; I can not believe that a decent organization such as ASCO would do it. It sounds more like a conspiracy theory to me. 

The other point is about the mortality rates and lack of improvement in cancer care over 30+ years. If you were a physician you would see how much progress we have made in 30 years. From better supportive care to better diagnostic methods. Do you really think that someone with brain cancer would have the same care 30 years ago ? There were not even CT scans 30 years ago. It is true that several cancers have very poor response to current agents, brain cancer being one example. But just a few examples would convince anyone: take the example of breast cancer. Today we have aromatase inhibitors, tamoxifen, sentinel lymphnode biopsies, more conservative surgeries and less toxic regimens. 

About the oral chemotherapy, I agree that it is far more convenient and less expensive to receive drugs orally. But it is a problem of pharmacokinetics, some drugs simply have to be given IV. The reimbursement for IV chemotherapy is much better, and it is true that there are people that abuse the system for their own gains, and I condemn that. There are targeted therapies that are IV, actually most of them are IV. They are certainly not the revolution that we had hoped, and I am sure some will cease to be used. 

I really wish I could individualize a treatment based on the biology of each patient's tumor. That will come. It is just too early. 

I appreciate your comments and bringing a constructive discussion about the subject.

							Flynn,
My opinion for what it's worth.  There is already a chance that you could have BC, or it may end up not being BC.  The pill, like condoms aren't 100%, but I sure wouldn't stay on the pill.  Too much is known about the pill, HRT etc.  I understand that not having kids is important to you, but as someone who's been dx with advanced BC and gone through multiple surgeries, chemo, radiation and was 43, I wouldn't do anything that could raise my chances of getting this disease.  I've been there, done that and I'll forever have a black cloud hanging over my head, like everyone else, not knowing if and when the cancer will return.  This disease SUCKS to put it mildly.  I'm just giving you my view from someone who knows the reality of this disease.
If you are certain you don't want kids, but don't want the have your tubes tied in case you change your mind, I'd talk to a gyn and see if there is anyway to do it and the chances being good that it could be reversed.  I know my SIL had her tubes tied after 3 kids and put some kind of clamp (I don't know the technical terms and it's been years ago) so they couldn't grow back but on the same hand, if they wanted to have more kids, which hasn't happened, it would be easier to reverse it.

							God..That is a big problem for me    I always was thinking that if I go to doctor really regurarly if someone is not good, it will be time to do something, I mean BC is also curable if you start early. Because I still would kike to wait until I am 35 and then if I really don't want kids have my tubes tied. But that means 5 more years with contraceptive pills   And all in all it would be about 10 years

							Hello, this topic is also important for me. 
I am 25 years old. I don't have any kids yet but I am married and I want to have them that's for sure. But right now the time is not good because I have just started new job, we still rent an apartment but we are planning to buy one soon and I haven't finished my studies so I guess I need to wait at least 2 years and maybe more. 
So I also take pills. I have been taking them since I was 18, so that's a long period. But I talked to my doctor, he says that I just need to check my breasts regurarly and that is nothing to worry about. 
In my family no one had BC, only my brother died from leukemia. 
What your comments on my situation would be. Is it still so dangerous to take pills for me?

							Hi,

Well, I just have to jump in here and say that if a woman is on some kind of hormonal manipulation that a doctor should never say ""there is nothing to worry about.""  JMHO  My mom took HRT for many years and got breast cancer.  I never took HRT but got it anyway.  I was never overweight, (always a little under) had a healthy diet and did not drink alcoholic beverages.  BUT...I DID take birth control pills.  Of course, when I started taking them, I was told they were very safe and there was nothing to worry about.  I hear from other women that lots of younger girls are being prescribed birth control pills to help with their cycles, etc.  It just makes me shudder.  I'm not saying that if you take birth control pills or fertility drugs that you will get breast cancer because not everyone does.  I just think that women have to be more cautious and seriously consider these risks.  

Also, another thing that ""irked"" me.  When I was first dx, I kept getting ""grilled"" about past hormonal manipulations.  ""Did you ever take birth control pills?  HRT?  Anything else?""  All of a sudden it WAS a big deal.  

I'm just saying it's wise to be very careful in this area.  It all depends on if the benefits outweigh the risks.  I just think women should be carefully informed of all the risks.  What is not seen as a risk today can be a risk tomorrow.

 There is NO CURE for breast cancer, regardless if you catch it early or not.  Even someone that is a stage I has a chance of having a reoccurence.  NO ONE is assured of not having a reoccurence.

Another thing.  I went for my mammograms, just like I was suppose to and also did self breast exams.  I found a lump and went to have it checked.  My mammogram showed ""normal"" and the ultra sound was read to be a benign cyst.  What the truth was, is I had Stage III breast cancer that had spread to 9 of my lymph nodes out of 16.

If you'll notice, the ads for HRT and the pill are trying to push the ""low hormone"" dose, but if you'll listen to them, they tell you that anyone that has been dx with BC should NOT take the pill or HRT......... that should tell you something when the companies that make the pill, HRT etc. are trying to make the dose of estrogen low and also giving the warning about BC.  

Will you definately get BC, no.  Would I ever put any kind of hormone in my body, no matter how lose the dose, even to stop hot flashes etc. NO.  I take Arimidex, something to kill hormones and hopefully it will prevent a reoccurence.  Unless you've been through the dx of BC and all the treatments and know that you are never safe from it coming back, I'm sure I seem melodramatic.  There is NO way I, or any of my friends I've met through BC boards would touch any type of hormone when most BC feed on hormones, estrogen and/or progestrine.

It's your choice of course, but I'm just stating facts and the fear that comes along with a dx of BC and never knowing when and if it will strike again, but again there is NO CURE for this disease and from the oncos and other health care professionals I've talked to, we're no where close to finding a cure.

							Nancy ~ I agree with you.  Although most women do well we don't know for sure WHO is going to do well or for HOW LONG.

When I finished my treatements I asked my rad onc if I was ""cured"" or in ""remission.""  He said, ""We cannot say cured.  We say you are NED."" (no evidence of disease)

Of course, I like to *think* of myself as cured, but no one knows for sure.  You could have poor prognositic indicators and do well OR you could have good prognostic indicators and do poorly.  We can only hope.

							Hello all:  I haven't written in awhile as I was writing under newly diagnosed and feel like I am oldly diagnosed now.  I have completed the four cycles of AC and have had my first dose of Taxol.  They gave me 50 mg of Benadryl, Kytril, and 20 Mg of Decadron prior to the Taxol. I also took 1mg of Ativan orally.

He said it was a reaction to the Taxol and would take four to five days to resolve./  I am worried about the next dose and if I am going to have more of a reaction.  I felt pretty crummy yesterday with nausea and had to take Ativan and Compazine.  I thought my stomach problems were going to be over with the Taxol.  I am taking Acidex now for the GI problems.

Once every Friday I went for my treatment.  I never got sick to my stomach, just very tired.  I did however, have rashes that occured on my arms and legs.  Not as bad as hives,but  it still itched.  I used some tree tea cream on the rash, smells awful but it seemed to calm the itch.  Taxol also made me lose my hair a second time.  It had started to grow back during my rads and keep growing through out my Taxol Treatment until the very last dose.  My Doctor gave me a double dose and the next day the hair started to come out.  Taxol, for me was easier than my A/C.  If you would like to email anytime that would be Ok.  (((HUGS))) Georgia

							Hello,
I posted previously under the name Lucy but forgot my password so I had to re-register.
Well, my mom was doing OK with her diagnosis of stage 4 lung cancer until recently.  No primary source of the cancer has still been found.  She only has had 1 brain met.  Originally, she was given about 6 months for her prognosis.
She is now 5 months into this.  AT the end of November, she was told she had no evidence of disease from the MRI of her head.  Ever since hearing that she was NED she has gone down hill.  It is almost as if she could not handle being told that she may be OK.
For the last 2 months I have been literaly fighting with her to eat.  I swear my cat eats more than she does!  My nerves are shot and I am so very tired.  I hate to say it but she has proven to be a very difficult patient.  I hate coming home because my house used to be so full of joy and life before she came to live here.
Nothing I do pleases her.  She speaks to me in a nasty tone most times and demands that I run my life around her.  She has even gone so far as to tell the Dr. that it is my fault that she is losing weight!
I have taken her to the Oncologist every week since this has started.  About 2 months ago I suggested to the Dr. that maybe she is depressed.  She was put on 100 mg of Zoloft.  Nothing has changed.  She complains of nausea constantly even though she has been on Zofran and Marinol.  She still won't eat.
I MADE her go to the Oncologist yesterday and when he saw her he flipped out.  (he has been aware that she quit eating)  He gave her a very, very stern talking to.  He basically told her that at the rate she is going, she has about a month to live.  She is totally wasted away.  She is 60 and walks like she is 90 and I am not kidding.
The Dr. asked her if she had given up.  She said yes.  The Dr. told her that she had to make some decisions over the next week.  She has to decide if she is going to fight this or not.  He told her that he could no longer help her if she won't help herself.  And he told her he was going to put a feeding tube in her next week.  
The Dr. told her that she is presenting as if she is full of cancer.  He said that she is either full of cancer, or she has given up.  She then asked that her MRI be repeated of her brain.  The Dr. finally agreed to that and I took her first thing this morning to get the test done.  We will know by next Thursday if there are any new brain mets.
Does anyone have any thoughts on this situation?  What more can I do to help her or is it possible that I can't do anymore?
Thanks for your time,

Again, I feel very sorry for your mother's situation, and yours too. I wonder also if she is depressed. Over and over we have seen how important the patient's attitude is regarding response. A cooperative patient is certainly much more likely to do well. Another factor that could be causing her problems is if the tumor is causing some problems with the brain and changing her behaviour. 

It sounds also that you are overwhelmed with this, and sincerely most of us would be. Have you contacted hospice or someone to help you ? Not only the patient suffers with this, but also the entire family taking care of her.

I wish you and her the best.

Thank you very much for responding to my post.
I have not contacted Hospice yet as her oncologist has found no evidence of disease left.  So, therefore, hospice cannot help me untill the cancer returns (if it does return).
At the end of November, all of her scans and tests were repeated and her brain was clear.  The doctors still cannot find a primary source.  In fact, her Dr. basically told her that she has been given a gift because stage 4 usually does not work out like this.
I have had a much better weekend.  I was feeling very overwhelmed when I posted that.
I still have not been able to get her to eat much more than she previously was but I have seen a slight improvemnt.  Maybe in a few days she will be eating more especially after hearing about a feeding tube being inserted.
How long do antidepressants usually take to work?  I too, feel that depression is playing a big part in this.

							dear lucy,

i am very sorry to hear about your mother's condition. i am sure the oncologist has many reasons to tell you that the patient is not in a good situation and her survival is limited. however, i think the fact that he is giving a set time for the patient to die did not help the prognosis.

usually no one can predict the time a patient may have for the rest of her life. physicians usually mention median survival time for a group of patients, but cannot predict for individual patients. 

please visit: http://www.thecancer.info/cancer/pro...tics/page1.htm
to learn about the median survival time for a patient and you can try to explain to your mother what is median survival and hopefully she will feel better. in addition, hospice is a great idea for terminally ill patients, although no one can predict how long she will have, there is no reason to let her suffer during the last period of her life. 

let us know if you have further questions.

							I have just read your post and I am feeling your pain.    My mom was diagnosed with stage 4 lung cancer and lived 5 years.    She was a living miracle.   Ironically, she did not die from  cancer.     She awoke one morning, Feb. 10, 2004, told my dad that she could not breathe, and died from a blood clot to her remaining lung.    My mom was deeply depressed after the discovery of the cancer.     She lay on the sofa most of the day and thought about dying.     Our whole family rallied around her but she just set her course for death.  She was 72 when she died.     She was a Christian and had comfort in her faith.    And even tho I am a Christian and knew where mom was going, it was the most difficult time in my life.    Mom would not take her prescriptions for depression regularly.     Looking back, I wish I had taken something!      I know exactly how you feel.........the anger, the fatigue, the sadness, the questions that have no answers.    Please know that I will be praying for you and you are free to contact me ANYTIME.    Don't stop trying, but try to not feel guilty.......sounds like you are doing all the right things.     Have you tried making her a protein smoothie?     They are full of good things and are a great food replacement.

I am feeling your pain too. Besides my recent uncle being diagnosed, What you have said reminds me of my grandma. She was a fighter and very strong but it was hard...and to be honest, at the time I was only 14 years old or so and I still cannot get that feeling out of my mind. All I can say to you is be strong and  keep going. I know you are hurting and it is very hard to see the one you love in pain..but be there for them....

							I am sure I have black mole cancer. I have not been able to get into a doctor because I have no insurance. That is one of the things they ask you on the phone when trying to make an appointment.
I have no money. Nothing. Do people in America just DIE when they have no health insurance? I have tried to get insurance, but there is a 6 month waiting period. I do not have 6 months to wait. I have waited too long the way it is.
Anyone have any suggestions? I would appreciate it. Thank.

							You need to do this through your hospital of choice.  Call the information number and ask to speak to one of the social workers.  They can move certain mountains with some difficulty, simply because the hospitals find it in their best interest not to turn down hardship cases.  The social workers are there to help you.  

One more thing.  If you are near a teaching hospital, do it there.  They seem to have the best resources.

It should be noted that in my state (Alabama) the University of Alabama, Birmingham, hospital works things out on a ability to pay basis.  They are also highly rated for cancer treatment.  Your state may have similar arrangements.

I believe that in most if not all states there is a medical program called Medicaid (not Medicare) for those who are unable to afford insurance. It is supported at least in part by Federal funding.

							I was diagnosed with Hodgkin's Lymphoma in June 2004.  I had no insurance, either.  I did not qualify for Medicaid or Medicare, or any other kind of government assistance.  I still owe about $2,000.00 or so, but most doctors are very good about helping you out by either setting up a payment plan or writing it off all together.

If you suspect you might have cancer, get checked out.  I know you may not have much money, but if you tell them you have no insurance, most doctors are really really good about helping you out.  One thing I learned, however, is that it is illegal for a doctor to assist you until you ask first.  Sometimes you have to jump through hoops in order to get financial assistance, and it is a pain to do, but it's worth it.  So far in my case, the hospital has written off about $60,000.00.  That's $60,000.00 that I did not have and would probably never be able to pay off had they not done that.  

However, your health is more important than the money.  Remember that.  No matter how much money treatment may cost, you cannot quantify your health.  There are things you can do; payment plans you can slowly pay off.  Heck, you could file for bankruptcy and be perfectly justified in doing so.

But go to the doctor.   And worry about the money later.

							It's shameful that in the land of the free so many people have to jump through hoops just to stay healthy and alive--and it can be darned hard to jump when you're sick, tired, broke and scared! I survived cancer without insurance (it can be done!) though my finances did not. There are doctors out there who can help you and I hope you find them. ""Keep your chin up"" sounds like hollow advice to someone facing the kind of challenges you are facing but the fact that you're reaching out with questions means you're that much closer to finding the answers and the care you need.

Lymphomas are a group of diseases that can behave in diverse ways. Some lymphomas grow slowly and are almost impossible to cure, and some are more aggressive but are easier to cure.

							dear dawn,
first thing first, what is the diagnosis? cancer in lymph nodes can be non hodgkins lymphoma, hodgkins disease, or cancer with lymph node metastasis. of course cancer is always not good, but the prognosis can be so different. 
stage hodgkins disease has a much better prognosis compare to a stage iv breast cancer with lymph node and distant metastasis.
please talk to the physician and obtain the diagnosis.

good luck,

							Leptomeningeal Carcinomatous (Carcinomatous Meningitis)

The most common cancers to involve the leptomeninges are breast cancer, lung cancer and melanomas, and now, because of dose-intense combination chemotherapies, even ovarian cancer is more common.

Unfortunately, cancer cells are too small to find on any scans unless they have grown into a lump. There can still be cancer cells in the body even though scans may have indicated that all the cancer had gone. Leptomeningeal metastasis (Lepteomeningeal Carcinomatous or Carcinomatous Meningitis) is a condition caused by cancer cells getting into the thin sheets of body tissue that surround and protect the brain and spine. These sheets are called the meninges. Meningitis means inflammation of the meninges. Carcinomatous just means acting like a cancer. Most people are familiar with the type of meningitis caused by an infection, but with carcinomatous meningitis, it is the cancer cells in the meninges that cause the inflammation, not an outside infection.

Tumor cells reach the meninges by hematogenous (blood) spread or by direct extension from pre-existing lesions and are then disseminated throughout the neuroaxis by the flow of the cerebrospinal fluid. Patients present with signs and symptoms from injury to nerves that traverse the subarachnoid space, direct tumor invasion into the brain or spinal cord, alterations in blood supply to the nervous system, obstruction of normal cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) flow pathways or general interference with brain function.

Secondary cancers from a primary cancer can develop in different parts of the body, including the brain or spine. Cancer cells do not always develop into an active secondary tumor when they have spread to a new site. Sometimes they stay inactive for many years. So, even after a cancer appears to have been successfully treated, some cancer cells may still be elsewhere in the body. No one knows why some cancer cells stay inactive or what triggers them to form a secondary cancer.

Symptoms from neoplastic meningitis include pain, headaches, mental status decline, loss of sensation in the face or elsewhere on the body, or difficulties with vision, hearing, or swallowing, among others. Diagnosis is most commonly made by lumbar puncture, although the CSF cytology is persistently negative in about 10% of patients with leptomeningeal carcinomatosis. Radiology studies may reveal subarachnoid masses, diffuse contrast enhancement of the meninges or hydrocephalus without a mass lesion.

Doctors estimate that about 5 out of every 100 patients who have cancer develop carcinomatous meningitis. It is most common in breast cancer, but it can occur with any type of cancer. The cancer cells in the meninges can cause a range of symptoms, including confusion, headaches and weakness. 

The condition is very difficult to treat. The main aim is to help control symptoms and not cure the disease. Chemotherapy injected into the spinal fluid (via Ommya Reservoir in the brain) or radiotherapy to the brain are both treatments for Carcinomatous meningitis. Some patients respond to these treatments, but the prognosis is generally poor. There are no set guidelines for treating this condition as oncologists don't really know which treatments work best.

Without treatment, the median survival of patients is 4 - 6 weeks and death occurs from progressive neurologic dysfunction. Radiation therapy to symptomatic sites and disease visible on neuroimaging studies and intrathecal chemotherapy increases the median survival to 3 - 6 months. Major favorable prognostic factors include excellent performance status, absence of serious fixed neurologic deficits, normal CSF flow scans and absent or responsive systemic tumor.

Oncologists have been looking at using different combinations of chemotherapy drugs to treat Leptomenigeal Carcinomatous secondary to the primary cancer (Chemosensitivity Testing may help in this process). They found that giving both chemotherapy injected into the bloodstream and chemotherapy given directly into the spinal fluid may improve the outlook for some people. However, current available therapies are toxic though, and provide limited benefits.

Approximately 50% of lung and breast cancer patients who survive more than one year with Leptomeningeal metastasis treated with repeated injections of intrathecal methotrexate develop leukoencephalopathy which includes confusion, dementia, somnolence or focal neurologic signs. This usually occurs when intrathecal methotrexate is combined with irradiation and this combination should be avoided if possible. The leukoencephalopathy may improve if intrathecal methotrexate is discontinued, although it may also progress to coma and death. Leucovorin is a faster acting and more potent form of folic acid. It is used as a rescue after dose-intense methotrexate therapy to lessen and counteract the effects of methotrexate toxicity and other folic acid antagonists.  

A medical oncologist involved with Chemosensitivity Testing has stated that their lab has only received maybe four Lepomeningeal Carcinomatous specimens over the years. Of those, only one specimen had sufficient tumor cells for testing. The problem is that it requires a specimen of cerebrospinal fluid, and it's not safe (with LC) to take more than a few ml of spinal fluid, and there are typically not enough cells to test more than one drug, if that. If there would be another site of the disease (lymph node, pleural fluid, etc.), then that could be biopsied. The biology of the disease, in all probability, would be similar to that of the lymph node, pleural fluid, etc. tumor.

If an assay test could not be performed and the disease had to be treated empirically, one protocol could be giving intrathecal thiotepa plus systemic gemcitabine (the gemcitabine given prior to the thiotepa). Thiotepa may be safely given intrathecally. Gemcitabine can probably be given intrathecally (it is somewhat similar to cytarabine), but it is thought that no one has ever done a clinical trial to prove that this is feasible and safe. In principal, the best shot would be intrathecal gemcitabine + intrathecal thiotepa.

Another alternative to Methotrexate is Cytarabine (cytosine arabinoside) or Ara-C. It is an anti-metabolite (like Methotrexate) which stops cells making and repairing DNA. Cancer cells need to make and repair DNA in order to grow and multiply. Ara-C is a clear liquid that can be dripped into a vein (intravenous infusion), into the spinal fluid (intrathecally) or by an injection just under the skin (subcutaneously).

A small molecule drug may be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Small molecule intervention can be beneficial by dissolving through the capillary cell membranes and absorbed into the brain. 

What may be another alternative is high doses of two small molecule EGFR pathway drugs, Tarceva (erlotnib) and Iressa (gefitinib), given together. It might cross the blood-brain barrier and some patients may get a long-lived remission with these drugs. 

High-dose tamoxifen could then be given continuously as a potentiator and an anti-angiogenic effect. This suggestion comes from cell function analysis. 

There has been clinical trials with molecularly-targeted Iressa for Leptomeningeal Carcinomatous from NSCLC. 

Iressa and Tarceva are very similar drugs, small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, a key intermediary in the EGF cascade pathway. They act on multiple receptors in the cancerous cells. 

EGF is epidermal growth factor. EGF is a receptor on many normal tissues/cells, and also on many cancer cells. It is a growth hormone, locally secreted by cells. It attaches to a receptor on the cell membrane called EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor). 

It then activates signalling pathways withing the cell (a cascade of biochemical events). One type of enzyme which is involved in the pathway is called tyrosine kinase. 

Targeted treatments like Iressa and Tarceva take advantage of the biologic differences between cancer cells and healthy cells by ""targeting"" faulty genes or proteins that contribute to the growth and development of cancer. 

So, in different tumors, either Iressa or Tarceva might get inside the cells, better or worse than the other. And the drugs may also be inactivated at different rates, also contributing to sensitivity versus resistance. 

I'm sure that Tarceva or Iressa would be more tolerable than Methotrexate, a mean and nasty drug. And you don't have to take Tarceva intrathecally.

Abstract

Objectives: To identify the incidence of leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (LMC), as the first site of systemic progression, in breast cancer patients after having obtained a major response (CR or near CR) to first-line taxane-based chemotherapy and compare these findings in retrospect with a matched-pair group of historical control patients from our database treated with nontaxane regimens.

Patients and Methods: Patients with histologically proven breast cancer having either metastatic disease or high-risk locoregional disease that were entered into treatment protocols with first-line taxane (paclitaxel or docetaxel) plus anthracyclines or mitoxantrone combinations and developed LMC as the first evidence of progression after major response (CR or >80% PR) were analyzed in the present study (n = 155), and compared, as regards the incidence of LMC, to a matched-pair retrospective group of 155 patients treated with nontaxane regimens in our unit.

Results: Seven patients with a median age of 54 years (range 40-70) developed LMC as their first evidence of progression after taxane-based regimens with a median interval of 6 months (range 2-18) from start of treatment to diagnosis of LMC. Five patients received intrathecal (i.t.) methotrexate treatment and whole brain radiotherapy (RT), while 1 patient received i.t. methotrexate and RT to the lumbar spine.

Two patients responded to treatment for LMC, while 2 achieved stable disease and 3 progressed. Two patients had elevated cerebrospinal fluid tumor markers (more than serum marker levels) that proved useful in monitoring response to treatment. Median survival after LMC was 3.6 months (range 1-17+) and correlated positively to the interval from the initiation of taxane-based therapy to LMC (r = 0.84, p = 0.019).

Seven out of 86 responders (8.13%) in the taxane group versus 1 out of 72 responders (1.4%) in the non-taxane-treated group developed LMC as the first sign of progression after a major response to first-line chemotherapy (p < 0.1).

Conclusions: LMC after a major response to front-line taxane-based regimens represents a grave disease manifestation and its incidence appears increased, but not significantly so, when compared retrospectively to non-taxane-treated patients.

Prospective evaluation of the incidence of LMC after taxane versus non-taxane-based treatment from large randomized multi-institutional trials is warranted and identification of potential prognostic factors might help to identify patients requiring appropriate prophylactic therapy.

							In the last decade, the incidence of central nervous system (CNS) metastasis has increased. The very first reference I found of this was a NCI observational study in 1995 that reported experience in their clinic where recurrent systemic disease occurred in all patients for which they received dose-intense Paclitaxel (Taxol) therapy. Brain metastasis was the only site of disease recurrence. The cerebellum was involved in two out of three patients, presenting with headache, dizziness, unsteady gait, nausea and vomiting (all the things that happened to my wife in 1998, after her adjunct Taxol treatment in 1997). 

This is what led me to research this further and found out about the rarity of ovarian cancer cells metastasizing to the brain. Ovarian cancer uncommonly involves the nervous system. Brain metastasis was a ""rare"" complication of ovarian cancer with only 67 well-documented cases in medical literature, until 1994. A multi-institutional study of 4027 ovarian cancer patients over 30 years identified only 32 cases while an autopsy study of ovarian cancer reported an incidence of 0.9%. Even more ""rare"" is the occurrance of Carcinomatous Meningitis. Until 1994, there have been only 14 cases reported. This presentation is similar to metastases from other solid tumors (breast, lung). (1) 

In 2002, I came across a study by Christos Kosmas, M.D., consultant medical oncologist, Department of Medicine and Medical Oncology Unit at Helena-Venizelou Hospital, Athens, Greece entitled, ""Carcinomatous Meningitis: Taxane-Induced,"" which found what is called ""dissemination after taxane-based (Taxol) chemotherapy."" The study conclusions stated that Carcinomatous Meningitis (a CNS metastasis) after a major response to front-line taxane-based regimens represents a grave disease manifestation and its incidence appears increased when compared retrospectively to non-taxane-treated patients. (2) 

A commentary by Dr. Lawrence N. Shulman, Vice Chair for Clinical Services and Adult Oncology, Dana-Farber Cancer Institute, Harvard Medical School, Boston, in the September, 2002 issue of The American Journal of Oncology Review, describes the complete lack of progress in the chemotherapeutic treatment of metastatic breast cancer since 1970. Dr. Shulman noted that a retrospective comparision of a well-characterized ""standard-dose"" database with a less well-characterized ""high-dose"" database suggested that there was increased early mortality for ""high-dose"" therapy. (3) 

An editorial by Drs. V. Valero and G.N. Hortobagyi in the March 15, 2003 issue of the Journal of Clinical Oncology, reviewed all of the large, prospective, randomized trials published comparing taxane-based chemotherapy regimens. They conclude that none of these regimens have increased either complete response rates or overall survival, with median survivals remaining at two years or less, or precisely the same results which were being obtained over thirty years ago. (4) 

In 2004, as reported at the 27th Annual San Antonio Breast Cancer Symposium, using a technique that quantifies circulating tumor cells, German investigators from Friedrich-Schiller University in Jena, have shown that neoadjuvant chemotherapy with paclitaxel (taxol) causes a massive release of cells into the circulation, while at the same time reducing the size of the tumor. The finding could help explain the fact that complete pathologic responses do not correlate well with improvements in survival. 

In the study, according to Katharina Pachmann, M.D., professor of experimental oncology and hematology, breast cancer patients undergoing neoadjuvant chemotherapy gave blood samples in which epithelial antigen-positive cells were isolated. Such cells are detected in most breast cancer patients but are rarely found in normal subjects. The investigators measured the levels of cirulating tumor cells before and during primary chemotherapy with several different cytotoxic agents. 

Paclitaxel (taxol) produces the greatest degree of tumor shrinkage but also the greatest release of circulating tumor cells. In three different paclitaxel-containing regimens, circulating cell numbers massively increased, whereas tumor size decreased. These cells remained in the circulation for at least five months after surgery. 

The tumor shrinks, but more cells are found in the circulation. This corresponds with a high pathologic complete response during paclitaxel treatment, but in the end, this is not reflected in improved survival. These cells are alive in the circulation. What this study has shown, so far, that in three different paclitaxel (taxol) containing regimens, as the tumor collapses (a clinical response, not cure), it produces the greatest release of circulating tumor cells. The study has not looked at any other combination regimens. (5) 

The results of these kinds of study are coming out slowly and quietly (now that Taxol is off-patent) and indicate that taxol containing regimens didn't prolong survival over other more conventional and less expensive cytotoxic drugs. Even before the advent of the CellSearch technique, it had been observed in various ""cell death"" assays, that there was an increase in the number of metabolic activity of mitochondria of the surviving cells from taxane therapy, even in cases where the majority of the cells are being killed by taxanes. It may indeed give clincial response (tumor shrinkage), sometimes impressive, however, these are mostly short-lived and relapses after a response to taxanes (Taxol) are often dramatic. (6) 

With these cells being alive in the circulation, it may mean that a patient with invasive breast cancer without lymph node involvement (where systemic treatment ""may"" benefit), or a patient with invasive breast cancer that involves lymph nodes (where systemic treatment is ""usually"" recommended), would need additional (anti-estrogen) treatment, such as Tamoxifen (it may be given alone or in addition to chemotherapy, if given). 

It has been shown that Tamoxifen treatment will reduce circulating tumor cells in some patients, but not all. So they develop a drug called Herceptin. Why? It has been shown that Herceptin treatment will reduce circulating tumor cells in patients with HER2-negative tumors, but less pronounced in HER2-positive tumors. 

Does Herceptin really work on these circulating tumor cells? A study from the Dana Farber Cancer Institute identified central nervous system metastases in women who receive trastuzumab-based (Herceptin) therapy for metastatic breast carcinoma. Central nervous system disease is defined as one or more brain metastases or leptomeningeal carcinomatosis (carcinomatous meningitis). 

Central nervous system metastases was identified in 34% of patients at a median of 16 months after diagnosis of metastatic breast cancer and 6 months from the beginning of Herceptin treatment. Patients receiving Herceptin as first-line therapy for metastatic disease frequently developd brain metastases while responding to or stable on Herceptin. (7) 

In 2006, another report that CNS relapses are common among breast cancer patients treated with a taxane-based chemotherapy regimen. Central Nervous System Relapse in Patients With Breast Cancer Is Associated With Advanced Stages, With CK-19 mRNA-positive Circulating Occult Tumor Cells and With Her2/neu-positive tumors.

During the past years it has been frequently observed that patients with breast cancer treated with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen, either in the adjuvant setting or in the metastatic setting, presenting central nervous system (CNS) involvement as the only evidence of disease progression. More studies were therefore interested to evaluate the incidence of CNS metastases in patients with early and advanced breast cancer treated with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen and to identify predictive factors for CNS relapse. 

Recent studies reported that breast cancer patients who received a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen had a significantly higher incidence of CNS metastases compared with that of patients treated with a nontaxane-containing regimen. There are also data indicating an increased risk for brain metastases in breast cancer patients receiving trastuzumab (Herceptin). 

In the present study it was also possible to confirm the initial clinical observation that breast cancer patients who receive a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen have a significantly higher incidence of CNS metastases compared with that of patients treated with a nontaxane-containing regimen. 

The reasons for the association between treatment of breast cancer with a taxane-containing chemotherapy regimen and an increased incidence of CNS involvement could be that taxanes are very lipophilic, their concentration in the CNS is very low after their intravenous administration. Taxanes are unable to penetrate the intact blood-brain barrier, the concentration of radiolabeled paclitaxel in the cerebrospinal fluid is found to be significantly lower than in other organs, and thus undetectable in the brain, in the spinal cord or in any other site of the CNS. 

Also, paclitaxel is exported from the p-glycoprotein and other ATP-binding cassette transporters placed at the luminal membrane of brain capillaries, as an explanation for the low concentrations of taxanes in the CNS. 

Furthermore, the detection of cytokeratin 19 (CK-19) and of mRNA-positive circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in the peripheral blood and the bone marrow of patients with breast cancer is correlated with increased incidence of relapse. 

The aforementioned data suggest that taxanes may not penetrate well into the CNS, and therefore the CNS may represent tumor 'sanctuary' sites for taxane-containing chemotherapy regimens. A difference in the incidence of CNS relapses between patients with breast cancer and other solid tumors treated with taxanes was observed. (8) 

The percentage of patients that must respond to a drug before it is approved by the FDA varies from as high as 80% to as low as 20%. Thereafter, it is used routinely for all patients with the same form of cancer, though unfortunately a drug that helps one person does not necessarily mean it will help all patients with the same diagnosis. The response rate for Taxol for FDA approval was 30%. 

Taxol (Paclitaxel) is known as a taxane type of chemotherapy drug. Taxol is given into a vein, but in order for the body to absorb the drug, it must first be dissolved in a solution. The compound wouldn't dissolve very much in any solution. It was discovered that something Taxol would dissove in the might work in a reasonably safe intravenous solution in humans. It was an elixir made of castor oil and marketed as Cremophor EL. It was the only answer. However, this castor-oil carrier is suspected as the culprit behind the misery which includes nausea, vomiting, joint pain, appetite loss, brittle hair and tingling sensations in hands and feet (neuropathy). (9) 

The American Cancer Society has mentioned that the solution can cause dangerous allergic reactions in many people, so patients ""must"" first take other drugs like steroids and antihistamines in ""hopes"" to prevent a bad reaction. The solution can also leach chemicals from regular plastic tubes used to deliver medication, so Taxol must be given through special tubing. 

A new drug for breast cancer (Abraxane) is a new form of Taxol (Paclitaxel). Abraxane does not need to be dissolved in the castor oil solution and does not require special equipment to be given to patients. However, more of the women on Abraxane had numbness and tingling in their hands and feet. And more suffered nausea and vomiting, diarrhea, muscle and joint pain and anemia. 

Taxol (Paclitaxel) is an extremely potent chemotherapy drug, often producing a number of side effects in patients. Side effects of Taxol (Paclitaxel) include severe allergic reactions, cardiovascular problems (such as changes in blood pressure), infections developing from white blood cell deficiencies, complete hair loss (apolecia), joint and muscle pain, irritation at the Taxol and other chemotherapy drugs injection site, low red blood cell count, mouth or lip sore, numbness or burning in the hands and feet, and stomach upset/diarrhea. (10)There is a molecular basis for the peripheral pain caused by Taxol. It appears to be caused when the drug binds to a protein and initiates improper calcium signaling, researchers at Yale School of Medicine reported in a study published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences. This response leads to side effects such as acute hypersensitivity, slower heart rhythms, tingling, numbness, and other symptoms. These serious side effects limit the drug's effectiveness. Peripheral pain becomes worse with continued use and increased dosages lead to persistent and irreversible pain. 

The binding protein is called neuronal calcium sensor (NCS-1). When paclitaxel (taxol) binds to NCS-1, it makes the cell more sensitive to normal signals and increases the magnitude and frequency of changes in calcium. Over time, increased calcium levels activate an enzyme (calpain) that degrades proteins, especially NCS-1. Calcium signals are needed for nerves to be stimulated and to respond and the loss of NCS-1 makes it more difficult to generate any calcium signals. While the loss of NCS-1 stops the protein interaction that is causing the inappropriate calcium signals, it also decreases the ability to have normal responses. (11)Sources:

							Hi, 

My dad is 78 and is fighting since July 2008 with lung cancer. Last month, we found out the cancer had spread to his brain and to the meninges. He started brain radiation and is finishing next week. His condition right now is stable, but he seems to be very tired right now, don't know if it's the meningitis or the radiation. 

Since we don't hear about carcinomatosis meningitis very often, I'll keep you posted on his journey and his treatment here. It's very frustrating to look for info about a subject and not find anything. 

Well, my father is dealing with 3 brain mets and the meningitis. He is finishing brain radiation, after that he'll have another spinal tap to see how the tumor is doing... If it's still there, he'll have interthecal chemo, four shots in two weeks. Straight after radio ends, he'll be starting Tarceva. He was tested for it and he is a perfect match, the only thing is that oncologists don't know how does Tarceva works on the meningitis. It's very efective in the nervous system but it's unclear if it works in the meninges. 
So, I'll keep you guys posted on how things are going and if I have some news. 
Love, 
Roberta

							Hi, as promissed, I'm keeping you posted about my father's treatment. 
Last Friday he had his first intrathecal chemo shot and is having the second one tomorrow. He is reacting well, until now had no side effects and is showing a slighty better mental consition, less confused. 
His last lumbar puncture showed 5% of neopasic cells in his liquor. Prior to the radiation therapy the count was 12%. The oncolgist is planning on 6 rounds of chemo to clear it for now. He already started taking tarceva for the lymph nodes and brain mets.

							Hello!
My father, who was suffering from carcinomatous meningitis due to lung cancer passed away today. He actually died from a lung emboli caused by tombosis in his legs. Because of that, the meningitis didn't run its whole course. 
I know it's very hard to find information on that topic so I'm posting everything that happened to him here, so it can give some answers to anyone in the same situation. 

He was diagnosed with carcinomatous meningitis on September 21st 2009. He also had three brain mets. The next day, he started radiation for both the brain mets and the meningitis. He did 15 sessions total and endured it well, feeling very tired towards the final sessions. His brain mets were gone and the neoplasic cell count in the liquor went from 12% to 5% with the radiation. 

Two weeks after that, he began interthecal chemo. He did 4 shots of it and started taking Tarceva together with it (he was a match). The chemo was unable to clear the liquor and he started to have a quicker mental deterioration. He was unable to walk without help and felt very tired all the time. But, his mind was right and he was very lucid. 

Last week, he had some problems in his liver due to medication he was taking and was admited in the hospital again (he did all the chemo at the hospital due to his difficulty to walk). Today, they found out the trombosis and he ended up dieing from the emboli (he couldn't take any mediaction to treat it because of the brain mets). 

What I know about the meningitis: The treatment has some level of response, he would still be alive today if it wasn't for the other complications. 

A physiotherapy is usefull to keep the pacient moving, and not attached to bed (that causes trombosis). It's also good for their self esteem. 

I don't know if I would do the intratechal chemo. It didn't show much result. The Tarceva works. When they took the Tarceva away (because of the liver problems) his mind deteriorated really fast. 

Well, this is my experience. Every case is diffent. Feel free to contact me at robertacastello@hotmail.com if you want to share stories or know anything about my case. 

I wish you all my best.

							A small molecule drug may be able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier (BBB). Small molecule intervention can be beneficial by dissolving through the capillary cell membranes and absorbed into the brain.

What may be another alternative is high doses of two small molecule EGFR pathway drugs, Tarceva (erlotnib) and Iressa (gefitinib), given together. It might cross the blood-brain barrier and some patients may get a long-lived remission with these drugs.

High-dose tamoxifen could then be given continuously as a potentiator and an anti-angiogenic effect. This suggestion comes from cell function analysis.

There has been clinical trials with molecularly-targeted Iressa for Leptomeningeal Carcinomatous from NSCLC.

Iressa and Tarceva are very similar drugs, small molecule inhibitors of tyrosine kinase, a key intermediary in the EGF cascade pathway. They act on multiple receptors in the cancerous cells.

EGF is epidermal growth factor. EGF is a receptor on many normal tissues/cells, and also on many cancer cells. It is a growth hormone, locally secreted by cells. It attaches to a receptor on the cell membrane called EGFR (epidermal growth factor receptor).

It then activates signalling pathways withing the cell (a cascade of biochemical events). One type of enzyme which is involved in the pathway is called tyrosine kinase.

Targeted treatments like Iressa and Tarceva take advantage of the biologic differences between cancer cells and healthy cells by ""targeting"" faulty genes or proteins that contribute to the growth and development of cancer.

So, in different tumors, either Iressa or Tarceva might get inside the cells, better or worse than the other. And the drugs may also be inactivated at different rates, also contributing to sensitivity versus resistance.

I'm sure that Tarceva or Iressa would be more tolerable than Methotrexate, a mean and nasty drug. And you don't have to take Tarceva intrathecally.

In the last yr I have gone through Lobular BC with a double Mast and on the left I had 19 Lympth nodes removed, all Neg. I had Reconstruction done and I did go through 4 rounds of Chemo, was due for 6 But The Chemo effected my heart. But anyway Iam fine all clear one year later.
My Cancer was brought on by Estogen,,, 12 yrs of it. I had a hyst at the age of 30. I was put on 1.25 and that is what the dr keep me on till I noticed my breast lump.I had many Mammo's and Ultrasounds and ALL failed me too..Another story!
Now my 20yr old daughter ask our same ob-gyn when she when for her check up, about her risks in BC! She is on birth control..
He said to her! and I Quote::::by the time you are in you early 40's you will have BC! I have never in my Life heard such a thing..That made me so angry for him to tell my young daughter that so now she is so scared..
Please can you tell me what you think??
Anyone out there tell me your thoughs..

							Hi Tammy,
I'll definately let the doctors answer the question but I was just wondering if you had that genetic testing?  I'm wondering if that is what he's basing it on.  I don't have kids and my niece wouldn't be affected by my dx, since she's my brother's daughter and from last I read, they don't consider that paternal side a factor.  I'm going to ask my onco about it when I go next month and if I misunderstood and she could be at a higher risk because of me being dx, then I'm going to check into that test.
Not everyone on hormones gets BC, but it's definately a scary thing now with so many being er and pr +.  I personally don't think he could say that with certainty, that she will have it by the time she's 40.  If he was, wouldn't he be snatching her off the birth control pills?
I know this has to be so upsetting to you and your daughter, but hang in there until Dr. Leo or Lu can answer your question.  I've heard of alot of GYN's that are trying to give HRT to BC survivors that have er/pr+ receptors......go figure.
If you need to talk, e-mail or pm me and I'll give you a call.

							Tammy and Nancy, I'll be interested in seeing what our resident docs have to say on this topic, too. But, I would seriously consider looking for a different OB/GYN. I think telling a 20-year-old she will have breast cancer by the time she is 40 is a terrible thing to do. IMHO, I just don't think they can be that certain. Lauri

What a story ! Certainly your daughter should have been told about this in a different way. There is no way anyone can predict that she or anyone will have breast cancer. Is she at a higher risk ? Yes because her mother has a history of breast cancer. But that does not mean that she will have it. Also, she probably should not be on oral contraceptives due to her higher risk. 

best regards,
Leo

							i surely do not agree with the answer with the physician of your daughter! i think the risk of breast cancer for a young girl is higher if her mother was diagnosed with breast cancer, but ""by the time you are 40 you will..."" is not appropriate. 
genetic testing is a good recommendation, and she may also consider early mammogram screening. 
lobular carcinoma are usually not detected by mammogram because it does not produce calcification, but your daughter may at higher risk for invasive ductal carcinoma too because of the family history.

good luck,

							Thankyou to all that replied to my Question.
My question Now Is to Dr Jay? What do you mean when you say my daughter has a greater chance developing BC because of Family Histosy? Do you mean Me? I am the Only one in the whole family that has ever had BC. So that does mean she is at a Bigger Risk now, even though my Breast Cancer was brought on by Premarin?
That is what I really don't understand? Why?
If I had a Hyst at a early age, No Cancer, and was put on this, ended up with BC later in the years why does this effect our daughters??
Thankyou for listening to my questions..

							Hi Tammy,

While you are waiting for the doctor to respond, I will share my experience with you.

My mom had postmenopausal breast cancer and she did take HRT for thirty years, due to an early-age hysterectomy for cervical cancer.  I know (for sure) that two of my aunts also had postmenopausal breast cancer.  I talked to my medical oncologist about this and he said there was not need to do a genetic test because these women were postmenopausal.  HOWWEVER.......I talked to Sue at the www.facingourrisk.org site and she said that this is not necesssarily true.  Although it does pose a lower risk, there still is a risk.  She said the best person to advise you as to whether a genetic test should be done would be a genetic counselor.  She said they will give you the facts and not ""push"" for you to have the test done.  It's a good site you and/or your daughter might want to visit.

Also, I think it's sad a doctor would say that to your daughter.  Honestly, some of the doctors out there scare me.

Good luck and good thoughts to you and your daughter.

							dear tammy,

one of the risk factors of breast cancer is having breast cancer in ones first degree female relative. if ones mother had breast cancer or sister(s) had breast cancer, the person has the risk factor.

that does not mean the person will or will not have breast cancer, just she has the risk factor. 

now, here is the second part of the question. you had a risk factor too, i.e., hormonal therapy. it is possible that you would not have breast cancer if you were not on the hormonal replacement. but so far we do not have much evidence whether HRT caused breast cancer will (or will not) carry the same risk for their female children.  we only know that breast cancer in ones family (first degree relative) is a risk factor.

let me know if you have further questions. i think you should not worry too much but your daughter should see her physician to talk about it. again, i don't think there is a guarantee that she will be diagnosed with BC when she is 40.

							Here is some info:




What is estradiol? 
 ?  Estradiol (a form of estrogen) is a female sex hormone necessary for many processes in the body. Estradiol vaginal products release estrogen that is absorbed directly through the skin of the vaginal wall. 
 ?  Estradiol topical is used to treat certain symptoms of menopause such as dryness, burning, and itching of the vaginal area and urgency or irritation with urination. 
 ?  Estradiol may also be used for purposes other than those listed in this medication guide. 




Who should not use estradiol? 
 ?  Do not use estradiol without first talking to your doctor if you have 
       a circulation, bleeding, or blood-clotting disorder; 
       undiagnosed, abnormal vaginal bleeding; or 
       any type of breast, uterine, or hormone-dependent cancer. 
 ?  Using estradiol may be dangerous in some cases if you have any of the conditions listed above. 
 ?  Before using estradiol, tell your doctor if you have 
       high blood pressure, angina, or heart disease; 
       high levels of cholesterol or triglycerides in your blood; 
       liver disease; 
       kidney disease; 
       asthma; 
       epilepsy; 
       migraines; 
       diabetes; 
       depression; 
       gallbladder disease; 
       uterine fibroids; 
       had a hysterectomy (uterus removed); 
       a narrow, short, or prolapsed vagina; 
       vaginal irritation; or 
       a vaginal infection. 
 ?  You may not be able to use estradiol, or you may require a dosage adjustment or special monitoring during treatment if you have any of the conditions listed above. 
 ?  Treatment with estradiol long-term may increase the risk of stroke. Because of this risk, you should contact your doctor or healthcare provider to discuss your individual risks and benefits before taking estradiol long-term. You should also talk to your doctor or healthcare provider on a regular basis (for example, every 3-6 months) about whether you should continue this treatment. 
 ?  Estradiol is in the FDA pregnancy category X. This means that estradiol will cause birth defects in an unborn baby. Do not use estradiol if you are pregnant or are planning a pregnancy. 
 ?  Estradiol may decrease milk flow and have other effects on milk composition. Do not use estradiol without first talking to your doctor if you are breast-feeding a baby.

							Here is some more info:

ESTRING  
Pharmacia & Upjohn  
Estradiol  
Estrogen  

Action And Clinical Pharmacology: Estring is a slightly opaque ring with a whitish core containing a drug reservoir of 2 mg estradiol. Estradiol, silicone polymers and barium sulfate are combined to form the ring. When placed in the vagina, Estring releases estradiol, approximately 7.5 g/24 hours, in a consistent stable manner over 90 days. Estring has the following dimensions: outer diameter 55 mm; cross-sectional diameter 9 mm; core diameter 2 mm. One Estring should be inserted into the upper third of the vaginal vault, to be worn continuously for 3 months. 

At menopause the ovaries cease to secrete estradiol (E2), leading to symptoms of estrogen deficiency such as sweating, hot flushes and sleep disturbance. A couple of years after the actual menopause, increasing numbers of women also report symptoms of urogenital estrogen deficiency such as vaginal dryness, genital pruritus, dyspareunia, dysuria and urinary urgency. These latter symptoms respond well to vaginal estrogen replacement therapy. 


~ I have heard ladies on some of the boards being prescibed this by their doctors.  Their doctors said that very little is absorbed.  However, some of the doctors said they advised against it.

							Hi Everybody,

Pro or con, nobody seems to have an answer to the question I asked, so I am still puzzled by the shortage.

I read the comments with a lot of interest because I am a bc survivor whose doctors are not opposed to my use of the E-string. My onc is very respected in his field nationally, and my internist is no slouch either. 

The package insert does indeed contain the warning about breast cancer. Whether it is there to simply provide protection for the manufacturer in these times of litigation for even the slightest possibility that it could influence the course of cancer or not is unknown.

We are a group of women with many, many different characteristics that influence our risk level. I would bet my bippy that the same docs who are open to my use of the E-string would be opposed to the use of it by some women who are staged III or IV, for example. 

Another aspect to this question is the degree of change in any particular woman's life as a result of her treatment for cancer. There are many women who are younger (and some who are older as well) than others and who do not experience the extreme, abrupt, permanent loss of libido, loss of lubrication, and loss of sexual identity to the degree that others do. 

That is why I don't think it is best to treat this as a black and white issue. Each one of us suffers different aspects of cancer to different degrees that beg for compassion and understanding, rather than division among us.

All too often health care providers dismiss this as simply an issue of figuring out how to provide adequate lubrication for the mechanical process of coitus. Most of the health care providers that we have the most constant access and exposure to will defer this issue to the oncologist. That is appropriate IF the the oncologist is genuinely dealing with the patient's full range of problems that are a direct result of the therapy prescribed by the oncologist.

Unfortunately, much of the time once the issue has been deferred to the oncologist and the oncologist makes a professional recommendation one way or the other, none of the other health care providers deal with any of the variety of other aspects of this problem that are facing the patient. Those issues are there, they are not simply ""in the patient's head"", and they need to be discussed with a focus on looking for solutions.

For some women, a valid PART of that solution is the use of the E-string or other similar products.

Just as we are understanding of each woman's choice in which therapies to use in the first place (such as chemo or rads, or hormonal treatments, etc.), let's not paint a black picture of this option for women who are simply trying to find a way to deal with their particular situation. Just as there are bc survivors who can perform coitus adequately with fake lubrication alone, there are those who need more than that and are finding the act of love to be a form of great pain both physically and psychologically.

Best wishes,

							Hello folks;

First, Cathy is doing GREAT! She had chemo #4 of 6 last Friday. The doc looked at her blood counts and said they were SPECTACULAR. His words!

My question: the doc said Cathy could take Vitamin E for her hot flashes (she is also on other meds for that). When we questioned him about that and anti-oxydants, he said NOT to take them within a few days of the chemo. She is on FEC100.

I guess this is just for my own knowledge, but how long does it take for the chemo drugs themselves to clear through the body? Are they sort of mixed in with the blood for a few days, or weeks, or what?

I'll let someone who knows a more definate answer, respond but I was told the reason that they want us to drink 8 glasses of water a day, but the 1st 3 days, including chemo day is to flush out the chemo.  As you know, I had the FEC also, but I'm not sure if the chemo latches on to cancer cells and won't let go and we're flushing out the chemo that is just going through our blood stream or what.  I'll be interested in hearing the answer to your question as well.

Different drugs have different half-lives (the average time it takes to get the levels to lower 50%). Some can take days, and some a few hours. The advice to drink water is to keep yourself hydrated and to increase the urine output so that the kidneys do not suffer much.

							I was diagnosed with ""bile duct cancer"" (cholangeocarcinoma) in September, was sent to UAB University Hospital in October for a Whipple Procedure (basically a removal of not just that bile duct but the head of the pancreas, top foot or so of the small intestine, part of the stomach, gall bladder, and some related parts and pieces) and now am currently finishing up a simultaneous radiation and chemotherapy series (using Xeloda, which is apparently experimental for this application).  The pathologist seems reasonably confident that they got it all out, and that long term remission is likely.

My point is this:  bile duct cancer can and must be treated fairly quickly, as it can rapidly spread into pancreatic cancer, which is frequently fatal.  I can honestly recommend both my surgeon (Dr. Selwyn Vickers) and the University of Alabama Hospital as being experts in this area. For having been deathly ill six months ago, I am amazed at how well things have gone.

Please, do not give up on this as untreatable.  And whatever you do, get it treated quickly.  This is very aggressive cancer.

Best wishes for her speedy recovery.

My thoughts and prayers are with you and I know that you will be able to deal with it in your own time and your own way.  Just know that you have friends thinking of you and praying for you.   Just remember your friends and how lucky you were to have known them.  They were lucky to have you too.

Good luck to you my friend.  I hope you find the peace that you are searching for.  I'm here if you ever need me.

							Hello,

in 2002, a rectal cancer was diagnosed. Too low location to avoid permanent colostomy, according 2 different French surgeons (I live in Paris), specialized in gastro-enterology and oncology...
We didn't accept that solution, and search for days on the Internet, hoping to find specialists for another way... 

England has an excellency center for those pathology, in Basingstoke (between London and Southampton) : the Pelikan centre, founded by Pr Heald.  He is a reference in colon and rectal cancer surgery. 
In France, we had no chance to avoid permanent colostomy; with him : more than 50%. 
His French correspondant in Paris is in St Antoine Hospital, we knew that from himself. In France, noone lead us to his latter, may be a ""concurrence"" between doctors ? or only the sincerity to do their best with such a perineal amputation (because of secondary risk, and the tumour location etc )? 
However, the surgery in Basingstoke was a success, it was our last solution.  

By searching on Google with those key words, you can find and understand more about what they do, and scientific articles.

For those living in Europe, it may be an easy way to get a second opinion.
He doesn't promise miracle, just does his job, but at its top.

All my best

in addition, no one can claim a patient as a dirty person because of a diagnosis of SIL or with HPV infection.

if the enlarged nodes persists, you should talk to the physician about further investigation. this picture can be caused by different diseases, such as infection, benign, or malignant tumors. since the consequences are very different, one thing for sure is to follow up closely with your doctor.

							Thank you for your reply. The ordering physician's office has informed that though the Dr will get the report by tomorrow, she will not be in her office tomorrow so I will have to wait until at least Monday. While this may not seem unreasonable to a physician's staff, it is very frustrating to have to wait through another weekend when the mass is in my body.

Also, I was wondering, if it was caused by an infection wouldn't I have an elevated white blood cell count? I had lab work done last week and the results were normal aside from some cholesteral issues. Again,thanks for taking the time to even read my concerns, seems more than my own physicians are willing to do.......

manifestations of infection can be very different from disease to disease. not all infection will cause systemic reaction such as elev white cell counts. for example, certain viral infection will not have elev WBC counts even they are systemic.

Hello there...I was in your shoes back in October 2004.  I was actually on this board looking for something else but I saw your post and it was so much like my experience that I had to respond.  

I found a palpable mass in my armpit on Oct 9 and went to my PCP.  They sent me for mammograms and then on for an ultrasound.  There was an enlarged lymph node that showed up on all of these tests but nothing else.  Then I was sent on to a surgeon to have a needle biopsy done of  the lymph node.  I found out on Nov 1 that I had a carcinoma with the markers of breast cancer.  To make a long story short...they did not find the primary tumor in my breast til I had the mastectomy.  The primary tumor was 1cm and the largest lymph node was 4 cm.  I'm not trying to scare you and hopefully you have already received good news from your doctor.  

That 3 weeks of waiting was the longest of my life.  The not knowing is really bad and you tend to jump to all kinds of conclusions.  Hopefully your outcome will be different than mine... But whatever the outcome, you have come to a good place to get answers.

							Hi Shelly..................thanks for your response. I am very frightened as you well know. I don't even see my surgeon for another 9 days and then what three weeks after that I'll get a diagnosis? By  then I'm sure I'll have mental problems on top of all............LOL

Where are you now in your treatment? How are you doing, feeling? I am very sorry to hear of your diagnosis.

							Hi there,

I'm doing the chemo portion of treatment now.  I go for my 2nd AC dose tomorrow.   I'm doing fine.  

I know exactly how you are feeling right now.  When you see a surgeon...if they do a biopsy it should only take a few days to get the results.  When you get the results, you will either be greatly relieved or you will feel like your feet have been knocked out from under you...depending on the results.  It did take me a few days to get over the shock of hearing the news.  My husband and I sat in the floor and cried.  The hardest thing was telling my kids and my parents.  I had to tell my oldest over the phone because she's away at college.  I emailed everyone else...it was much easier to sit and type it all out and send it to everyone and not have to keep going over and over it.  I've got a list of people that I email regularly to update them on my progress.

If you get a diagnosis like this, you'll be surprised at the strength you have deep down inside you.  And you'll be surprised at the generosity of friends, acquaintences and family members.  Hopefully your diagnosis will be something simple and easy to fix.  If you need to talk, email me at sgishelly99@aol.com...put ""cancer forum"" in the subject so I won't accidentally delete it thinking it's spam.

Started chemo, 6 TAC treatments,  two weeks ago.  My question is about the nodes.  What does fixed or matted mean when speaking of axillary nodes?  Also, movable axillary nodes.  Also, it seems it broke out of the lymph nodes and was found in the skin, would this be matastic BC of the skin?

							hi rhonda,

""fixed"" or ""movable"" are clinical descriptions used by physicians. 
when the node is enlarged but the cancer has not extended into the surrounding tissue, the enlarged node can be palpated but isolated, thus movable on palpation. 

however, when the affected node(s) have extracapsular extension and the disease directly invades the surrounding tissues, they can be fixed because the cancer tissue connected the nodes with the surrounding soft tissues (like muscle). in addition, when several nodes are involved and connected with each other by cancer, they can also be ""fixed.""  

BC can met to skin, but more commonly seen situation is that the disease has direct extension into the skin.

let us know if you have further questions.

good luck,

							Hello,

I was in the process of searching information about tissue expanders and came across your site. I have read the postings with interest and would like to be on board also.

I had a lumpectomy in 91 with radiation and here I am 13 years later with re-curring breast ca. I elected to have a bi-lateral mastectomy because I don' t want to do this any more. I had the sentinel node dissection done and there was no sentinel node found so they removed a few nodes to be safe.  I have tissue expanders in and will start expansion next week. I have found this whole thing quite uncomfortable expecially the side that was previously radiated. I am now on anti-biotics for infection.

When I saw the plastic surgeon she said I cannot use antiperspirants. Have any of you been told that? When researching I also found that parabens are thought to be a bad thing with breast ca. Do you know anything about that?

I have to say only prayer has brought me through this. I am so looking forward to getting the next surgery over.

							Hi, Betty, and welcome to out place. Sorry to hear that you have had a recurrance. Most would assume that after 13 years you would have been considered ""cured,"" but this is just another example of why we are reluctant to associate that word with breast cancer. I know the survivors and the doctors disagree on this point, but too often we hear of long-term survivors who have recurrances. I cannot answer your questions, but I am sure others will offer their views. There is a good Web site at www.imaginis.com that has a lot of breast cancer information. You might try there. The only time I was advised to avoid anti-prespirants was during radiation and before mammograms, so I am not sure what your plastic surgeon is concerns about. Again, welcome on board. I'll scoot over to make room on the sofa for you. Hugs, Lauri

							Molecular breast imaging sensitive for detecting smallest tumors

Anne Harding
Reuters Health

Posting Date: January 20, 2005
Last Updated: 2005-01-20 15:09:12 -0400 (Reuters Health) 

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - A technique called molecular breast imaging (MBI) is highly sensitive in detecting small lesions and can also spot tumors missed by mammography and ultrasound, according to a report in the January issue of Mayo Clinic Proceedings. 

The results on the first 100 patients are ""just staggering,"" lead author Dr. Deborah J. Rhodes of the Mayo Clinic College of Medicine in Rochester, Minnesota, told Reuters Health. ""This technique really has many, many implications and many potential applications, but we certainly need further studies.""

Dr. Rhodes and her colleagues have improved on scintimammography by building a gamma camera specifically designed to image the breast. The cadmium-zinc-telluride system measures uptake in breast tissue after technetium Tc 99m sestamibi injection.

In their report, they describe the findings for the first 40 patients. All of the women had lesions 2 cm or smaller identified by mammography as ""highly suggestive of malignancy,"" and were scheduled for needle biopsy. The women all had MBI within a day of mammography.

Twenty-six of the women had a total of 36 malignant lesions. MBI detected 33 lesions, for a sensitivity of 92%, and 19 of 21 lesions 1 cm or smaller, for a sensitivity of 86%. MBI also identified four lesions missed by both mammography and ultrasound.

Scintimammography is used to complement mammography, the researchers note, but the design of conventional gamma cameras makes thorough imaging of the breast difficult and detection of smaller lesions impossible. The camera the researchers developed not only can identify smaller lesions, they note; it also uses lighter compression than employed by mammography systems, making it more tolerable to patients.

MBI may be particularly useful in patients with dense breast parenchyma, in whom standard mammography is much less sensitive, or women who are at greater risk of breast cancer, the researchers note. 

Relative disadvantages of MBI, they continue, include the necessity of radiotracer injections and the longer time required (40 to 50 minutes compared to 15 minutes). However, Dr. Rhodes said her group is developing a double-headed version of their MBI camera that will cut imaging time in half.

MBI has a number of advantages over MRI for detecting breast cancer, according to Dr. Rhodes. While MRI requires radiologists to sift through hundreds of images and interpretation is subjective, ""the interpretation of these images is really pretty binary -- there's either an abnormality or there's not."" She added that once it is in wider use, the cost of MBI will likely be reduced.

Dr. Rhodes and her colleagues are now planning a study of MBI screening as an adjunct to mammography in women with dense breast tissue or a history of breast cancer or both.

The method could also be useful in a number of other situations, she added, for example patients with LCIS on prior biopsy; patients with biopsy-proven cancer who are going to surgery; or breast cancer patients with scar tissue from surgery or radiation. ""These are all areas that we're going to be investigating in the very near future,"" Dr. Rhodes added.

In an accompanying editorial, Dr. Rachel F. Brem of The George Washington University Medical Center, Washington, DC, calls the study ""an important contribution to the field of molecular/physiologic imaging for the diagnosis of breast cancer."" 

Mayo Clin Proc 2005;80:17-18,24-30.

							I have a question regarding Osteoporosis and bone marrow disorders. Since the blood cells are formed in the bone marrow. Would severe osteoporosis have an effect on how well the bone marrow would function in creating healthy blood cells? I do realize that osteoporosis usually effects the hard outer portion of the bone. If the bone marrow were effected, would this result in a change in the DNA of blood cells that would be significant enough to cause leukopenia? Or, is Osteoporosis one of those diseases that has been popularized by Pharmaceuticals, much in the way that social anxiety has been popularized by Zoloft, Paxil ,ETC?

I think that is a market manipulation event among pharmaceutical companies. But, it does allow copy cat companies to come in and manipulate the formula and then market it as their own.  This is where the capitlistic system of marketing gets in the way of health sometimes. It happens pretty often in the psychotropic medications. The concoctions that some of these companies come up with are not very beneficial when they start tinkering with it.

							I have a friend who was diagnosed with Stage 4 liver cancer in November.  She is taking chemo but is very sick and has lost over 35 pounds and battling constant infections.  I talk to her at least once a day.  She told me the cancer started in her pancreas and then went to her liver.  She gave me a copy of the lab report on the original biopsy as I have some medical transcription experience and she didn't understand all the terms.  But what I don't understand is this:  It states ""adequate, large cell carcinoma"".  I always thought large cell carcinoma referred to lung cancer.  I asked her again and she says they said nothing about lung cancer.  There is no mention of lung cancer in this report.....pancreas either.

There is also a number/letter combination at the end of the report I don't understand....PAS9......does this mean anything?

The doctors gave her no 'time line' on life expectancy.....only a 30% chance of 12-18 months IF the chemo helps.  She has started and stopped chemo twice due to infections.  She is now on procrit which has raised her hemoglobin to 15, which they say is good.  She has no energy, lays in bed all day and is winded just walking a few steps to the bathroom.  Can any of you give me your experiences and knowledge with this disease and its progression?  I feel she doesn't have long and she sort of leans on me......this is very difficult as you all know.

							first of all, the most common liver malignancy is not liver cancer but metastatic disease from other organs. pancreatic cancer may met to the liver and cause ""secondary liver cancer."" 

the most common primary liver cancer is hepatoma or hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC). the most primary pancreatic cancer is adenocarcinoma. adenocarcinoma can be ""large cell"" or have other description, and pancreatic adenoca can also be ""large cell"" although this is not a common major description in path report.

you are right, lung cancer can be ""large cell"" too. large cell lung ca is a type of adenoca but historically called ""large cell."" 

the best way to find out the true diagnosis is to talk to the oncologist and ask him/her to explain what the diagnosis is. you friend may want to ask if there is primary disease found in pancreas and if the biopsy was taken from liver or the pancreas. also ask if the ""large cell"" type cancer is a type of adenocarcinoma according to her path report.

							Thank you for your reply.  The biopsy was taken from her liver only and there was a CT scan done.  We were told there was no cancer in her lungs or lymph as of two months ago. She was diagnosed as Stage Four and was told she is not a candidate for transplant or any surgery.  Her first course of chemo ends this week and a new round of tests will follow. The first diagnosis was on November 16, 2004. 

As of today she is running a temp. on antibiotics and in a great deal of pain in spite of a pain patch and oral medications.  She is at home.  She is questioning if the chemo is 'worth it' in the long run as she has no quality of life.

maybe you could ask doctors about dexamethasone and aloxi and see if it could help improve her quality of chemo, but im sure these things vary from person to person, and Im only 17, so i dont know the full extent to these medications.

I hope i was helpful in some way. I hate to hear of people suffereing  
Best of luck to your friend.

if you happen to ask about the medications i mentioned, and the doctor declines it is probably for the best, and he probably has his reasons, and i would listen to him, because like I said, im only reporting what I see and dont know the entire thing about these medications.

							My 13 year old son has been sick for approximately two weeks (this time) has been sick every 5-6 weeks for approximately 6 months now.

Recently, A doctor found a lumpy oatmeal type lump in the lymph gland in his left arm pit.  Prior to this he had run a 104 fever--runny nose--cough--sore glands (neck and groin area)  and broke out in a strange rash they called Erythema Nodosum.........He has since turned a light blue color--sort of like a moduled baby when they are cold.  Blood test revealed reactive lymphicites.

Due to some questions that were asked during exam--doctor immediately started talking about a bone marrow byopsy----(Scared the living day lights out of this mother.)  

He recommended we see a Ped. Immunologist who really did not pay a lot of attention to the reports from the other doctor nor did he listen to us when we stated that our son now sleeps 14-16 hours at a time when we were lucky if he slept 9 hours before getting up to go again.  Very Active Child who gets very tired now. Nor would he listen to use when we told him that the (3) other doctors had placed him on Prednisone.  

My major concern about a lymphoma or possible leukemia is that my grandmother was the first woman diagnosised with Hodgekins in the US and both she and one of her son's died of hodgekins.  Also, on my husbands side of  the family his grandmother died of mulit meylomia--

Should I go back to the orginial doctors and request a second opinion and possible more blood work up or should we just go right to the original diagnosis of a bone morrow byopsy?

At this point in time fear in ruling me and I am not sure if I am thinking clearly or not.

Any responses will be greatly appreciated.

Sincerely,

One very scared mother

While you are waiting for in put from medical advisers here, this is from one mother to another. If you have the means to do so, you take your child to another doctor and get as many opinions as you feel are necessary to get the right treatment. Either I am misunderstanding your post or there is still a lot of confusion as to what is wrong with your child, but either way, it needs to be addressed properly.

							Thank you very much for your reply.  Since my last posting we have found out that my son does not have lupus or JRA or Mono or any of the Mono related infections.  His new blood work up still shows elevated Lymphacites and reactive lymphacites.  He continues to have the swelling under the left arm pit and continues to be extremely tired all of the time.

We believe that the bluish color to his skin was from the prednisone. However, that is just our guess.

We are indeed getting another opinion concerning this matter.  I will mortgage myself to the hilt if that is what it take to ensure that my son gets better.

Again, thank you for your concern and your reply.

							Hi Lisa,

Well I certainly hope that you can find out soon what is wrong with your son!!! If your not happy with the finding see another doctor, go to the childrens emerg if you have to! You need answers and if you are arfaid it might be cancer then fight all the way the sooner you know the better.

I was diagnosed with Lymphoblastic lymphoma when I was 11 and am thankfull for my mom pushing for results all the way.

 I have always heard that if your lymph nodes hurt that is a good thing as opposed to them being swollen and not hurting. So maybe it is a good thing that they hurt as it may not even be cancer. But if you are still worried then do anything within your power.

I hope all turns out well for your son!!

Thank you so very much for you email.  

We did indeed see another doctor today.  During all the fancy bloodwork and simple Physican's Assistant recommended that they run and A Cartoid test.  This test showed that my some have microplasmas in his blood.  That is (as explained by the doctor) a bacterial infection in the plasma of the blood.  They have put Ethan on zythromax for up to three weeks (one week at a time until he either responds or does not respond).

If at the beginning of the 4th week his lymph nodes in his left arm pit are still swollen and his blood tests still show elevated lymphacites and reactive lymphacites and his red and white blood counts are still at a 50-50 split (which he explained is not a balance it should be a 70-30 split 70 being white and 30 being red)  then he will send us directly to Children's Hospital for a complete work up to ensure that nothing is missed and to make sure that his bone marrow has not been compromised in any way.

So, I am praying that it is a simple infection that will respond to the zythromax.

I will continue to give updates on Ethan until we are in the clear.  If you or anyone else has any advise or just wants to let us know how you are please continue to reply.  

And to all the Actual Cancer patients and survivors out there, YOU ARE ALL IN OUR PRAYERS.  MAY GOD BLESS YOU EVERY SECOND OF YOUR DAYS.

Sorry for not responding earlier. Anyway, it seems your son is under the care of good doctors. Infections can cause enlargement of lymphnodes, and all sorts of weird blood reactions. If he has a Mycoplasma infection then he should get better with treatment, and things should return to normal soon.

							Hello Lisa - This is my first post to this site. I am on here to gather information for my son Kyle who is 3 and is going in for biopsies on Tuesday. 

I read your post about your son and his health so far. The doctor that found the lump who sent you to the ped immunologist sounds like he is competant... but I would seek a 3rd opinion from another specialist since the 2nd guy was not very attentive.

Your family history along with the elevated lymphicite count would be enough for me to seek more information.

Matter of fact, this is exactly where we are right now with our 3 year old. Family history and blood test results that are conflicting.

							Hello. I just found out that my Daddy has cancer. He has been going through radiation and chemotherapy alone, as he has not told anyone about this. I only found out because I went to visit him and got a phone call that his appointment had to be changed because the radation machine was down. I felt so hurt and MAD that he would keep something this serious from me. I did confront him about it and he admitted it but gave me only brief answers to my questions. He seemed to get annoyed so I dropped it (for now).  He has seemed to open up a little in the past week. I think the thought of him going through this alone hurt me more than the cancer itself. Anyway, it was found because he was having shoulder pain and was found to have a torn rotator cuff. I guess the CT scan also showed a mass. He was telling me that it is a tumor associated with his scapula. However, I finally got him to answer some questions for me and I asked him what the name of the cancer is. He said, ""small cell"". Everything I have looked up associates small cell with lung cancer. His sister died of throat and lung cancer. My questions are;
1) Is small cell cancer only associated with the lungs?
2) He seems to be opening up a little bit now and I don't want to aggrivate him but the unknown is killing me. I don't understand how someone could want to go through this alone. Does this happen with a lot of cancer patients and, if so, is it likely that he will talk more freely about it? Should I be more agressive about this or just keep waiting for him to talk?
3) If he is lying to me, should I confront him about it?

Thanks for any imput you can give me.

							I lost a brother to non-small cell cancer. When some one is diagnosed with cancer they get scared, they go into a denial phase where they believe that if they do not tell anyone then it will make the diagnosis not true, or they will not have to deal with their own feelings, or any one else's. IT is a phase of getting toward acceptance of a shock, or surprise. Your dad is an adult and his wishes should be honored. If he wants to talk, talk to him, if he indicates he had rather not talk about it, then let it be but let him know you are there if he changes his mind. IT really is not your ""right"" to know it is your privilege to be allowed into his feelings about it. I think you must care a lot and this will be difficult for you, but that is why cancer is so scarey. It reminds us that we all die.

							I understand what you are saying and I know you are right but my heart is so hurt. If I am having all these emotions...I can't imagine what he is going through. I'm not pressing him to talk too much about it. When I get a little info, I try to look things up. I guess thats how I'm gonna have to find things out until he wants to open up a little more. Thats why I am asking about small cell? I just want to know if it can be associated with anything besides the lungs. Thanks.

							dear j:
sorry to hear that your father has small cell cancer. here is my understanding of the disease:

the most common primary site for ""small cell"" cancer is lung. about 20% of all lung ca cases in u.s. are small cell lung cancer. 

small cell lung cancer and small cell cancers from other origins are usually systemic disease and for most patients, chemotherapy is required.  

whether a patient wants to share his condition with his friends or family members, even with some of their physicians, is competely their rights.  i understand that you want to share his pain and make him feel better, but if the patient does not want to talk about his condition because that will cause emotional stress or of other reasons, you should not force him. however, i do think that family support IS extremely importing during cancer management. 

i am not sure what you should do when he is lying to you. but my personal feeling is that aggravating him is not a good idea. 

let us know if you have further questions.

good luck,

							Dear J~

I am very sorry to hear about what you are going through.  I understand that you must be so frustrated and worried about your father ~and the lack of information must make it worse for you.

What prompted me to reply to your message is that I was in the same boat as your father~ I was diagnosed with cancer almost seven years ago and although I did tell my family, I often kept information to myself because I did not want to make them worry.  I already knew that my parents were worried beyond belief, so I tried not to say too much about things unless absolutely necessary.  What I didn't realize until later is that what I was doing was making them worry even more than they would have if I had have been open and honest with them.  Also, the more I talked about it, the more ""real' everything seemed.

Unfortunately I can't help you with any info about the type of cancer your father has~ but I simply wanted to drop you a line and wish you well and also explain where I was coming from when I was choosing not to share info with my family.  Its something I absolutely regret now, but at the time I thought it was a way to deal with things and make my family worry less   

All the best~

							I had a limited nodal dissection on 1/25/05, and the results were negative.    I am so very fortunate.    I feel like a miracle has happened, and will forever more give thanks.

So, I am now officially stage I with Histology Grade 2 (E/P positive, but Her-2/neu negative).
I anticipated at each step of the diagnostic process, that there would be pain almost too much to bear.   

However, with local anesthesia the wire localization was painless; the lumpectomy on 1/5 was painless (thanx to the surgeon who filled my wound with local anesthetic before he closed); the SNB and radioactive tracer was painless (thanks to the new process of diluting the tracer); and the nodal dissection was painless thanx to Lortab q 4 hrs after surgery and a terrific anesthesiologist who was 'into' pre-emptive analgesia; and the axillary drains after surgery, while not the greatest thing, are certainly not painful (and what would happen with all that fluid, if I didn't have any drains?   daily trips to the surgeon for aspiration sure don't sound very appealing)

The interminable wait between procedures and/or interim path reports to obtain the final path reports were what caused the most anguish.   Time has never gone so slow.

The friend I made from this forum, and close friends/family at home, made all the difference in the world.   Without them, my emotions would not have been as stable nor as positive.

Just wanted to provide an update, and maybe a hopeful note to others who are still undergoing the diagnostic process........

Now...........onto treatment...............

							Thank you Dr. Lu

The surgeon had previously said that if the nodes were negative, I would require radiation therapy.    I would like to have a mammosite; however, not offered yet in my area (6 months from now, but not now).   

And, he said he would also refer me to an oncologist, as I probably would need Tamoxifen or Arimidex (I already have osteoporosis, so I don't know how they would handle the Arimidex........)

I don't think I will need any chemotherapy; at least, they haven't mentioned that yet.    So, if I do, I am totally unprepared.

							Hi,
I had a somewhat similar diagnosis and pathology to you.  I just want to mention that the standard is to give chemo for cancers greater than 1cm.  However, recently they are finding that certain DNA tests can determine if the chemo is really needed in cases like yours and mine (1.6cm).  I was diagnosed 4 years ago and my oncologist didn't have those tests available but he convinced me that I wouldn't benefit much from chemo because my cancer was especially slow growing and very very estrogen and progesterone sensitive.  Therefore he felt the gain wasn't worth the chemo risks.  It was a difficult decision to make but I am now happy that I decided not to do chemo.  I am NOT saying that you shouldn't have chemo... just that there may be a test out there that will tell whether you should.

							I was stage T1a, er2 3+  very agressive and large area, luckily the invasive component was small,  My oncologist said the risk benefit ratio of chemo led her to believe chemo wasn't advisable. She would have started me on something had I been ER/PR + but Herceptin, which works on HER+ cells has some nasty side effects I guess.  Although I am VERY grateful for not needing chemo, it worries me that some little sneaky CA cell could have gotten out and made itself at home somewhere else in my body,  I have my 6 mo appt in March and I am going to ask that she at least do some lab evaluation for tumor markers - to my knowledge none have ever b een taken.

							Hi Madge/Rita, 

The ""tiny cancer cell that remains"" is sort of theoretical... and chemo can also cause cancer...

Mine was 1.6 and I am ER/PR+ too but not slow-growing, more's the pity. I did CAF x 6 and rads and am hopeful for new methods so that there will be fewer women who end up having to go through it -- especially since the vast majority of women who are stage 1 apparently would do just fine without anything but surgery.

							I have had an enlarged lymph node on the side of my neck for several months.  I went to the doctor about it & she did a CBC which turned out normal & then sent me for a CT neck scan.  The scan results showed I had some enlarged nodes but said they all looked normal.  Would the CT scan definitely rule out cancer?  I'm thinking that maybe I should have requested a larger scan that would've include my chest & under arm area.  My guess of the size of the node is about 1 -1.5cm.

							Hi Carmen,

If you are still worried then you can ask your Dr to run a simple test on your lymphocites. It will show if they are elevated and will alert them if there is anything to worry about. But these are questions you should ask your Dr. A CT scan by itself couldn't totally rule out cancer so if you are worried go back to your DR.

							Difficult Diagnosis

Brief Case Description: A 65-year-old (52.5 kilograms) Chinese woman was operated on January 7th in Nanjing, China, to remove gallstone using Laparoscopic cholecystectomy. During the operation, the surgeon surprisingly found significant collection of mucus fluid in the peritonea; the peritoneal and intestinal walls and other organs had connections with each other; some nodules were seen, especially around the appendix. The operation surgeon consulted another two surgeons, but could not form a consensus diagnosis. Both Pseudomyxoma peritonei and appendix mucus carcinoma with wide peritoneal metastasis were suggested as possibilities. The laparoscopic examination was videotaped and the mucus and peritoneal collagen samples were taken, along with the gallbladder, for pathological examinations.

Laboratory Findings: pelvic examination by B ultrasonic equipment revealed dwindled uterus; CT scanning of the lower abdomen found occupying change in the ileum and cecum area with fluid collection between uterus and rectum; muscus smear of the pathological samples revealed gathered abnormal cells, tumor possibility could not be ruled out. Peritoneal fiber, fat and muscle tissues were enriched with large number of acute and chronic inflammatory cells with mucus in the background.

Past History: The patient had a severe inflammation of the Fallopian tubes 30 years ago that caused the blockage of the tubes. In the mid 70s, she was often bothered with lower right abdominal pain, not knowing if it was the Appendix inflammation or not, which relieved with some treatment. She also had stomach upset with pain and gas from time to time. In the mid 90s, she was found to have inflammation of the gallbladder and gallstones by B ultrasonic diagnosis, which was treated by medications. In the same time period, EKG found the enlargement of left ventricle and upside-down T wave. Echocardiography found light close-up of the mitral valve. Blood pressure was not stable. Medications were regularly used. Abdominal pain and upset became more serious in recent years, especially after a meal. After traveling in last May, she had diarrhea for one month with black stools in no fixed form, and the abdominal pain became unbearable. So she decided to have the gallstones removed. The surgeon also sucked out some mucus collections in the peritonea. Other problems included frequent cold, rhinitis, joints and back pain.

Diagnosis: Doctors in Nanjing had different opinions about the diagnosis. In addition to Pseudomyxoma peritonei and appendix mucus carcinoma with wide peritoneal metastasi as suggested above, ovary mucus cancer was also suggested. Most were not sure if it was a cancer or a benign tumor. As to treatment, some suggested immediate surgical operation; others did not consider it meaningful; some suggested the operation could not clean all the metastasis out and the prognosis would be poor with possible recurrence.

							Hello

Thanks for posting. This is indeed a very difficult case. The presence of abnormal cells does not definitely mean that this is cancer, but it most likely is. While I will not be able to give medical advice about this, I would be interested in knowing more details about the cells, including immunohistochemical profile and a detailed pathologists report.

							Yep, you've done good Leo   I've been on several boards and this is by far the best one.  The posts sometimes may be blunt, but also in good taste and the other person knows that we want them to accept nothing less then a definate answer and the best care possible.
Seems to me we have an epidemic going on with this disease and I wish there was alot more money going into research.  I have seen full page ads in magazines, not promoting any drug, but promoting the need for more money in hopes of finding a cure.  I think more and more people have been affected by this disease, one way or another and finally realizing that it's not going to go away just because everyone wants it to.

I just wanted to put my 2 cents in, o.k. 3 cents... lol

I'm getting more and more nervous as my check up time gets closer, just a little over a week.  I pray that I'll be able to come on the forum and post a big 3 years NED.

							Hi, Everyone,

I was just diagnosed with carcinoma ductal, 2.8 cm, poorly differentiated with abundant necrosis, grade 3, 12 oclock, right breast. It's funny how breast cancer can be so wordy!  I am trying to keep my humor but find those times when the fear is overwhelming are getting more frequent. My doctors have been extremely fast about setting up surgery. I will get a lumpectomy with sental node biopsy and if posititve, my surgeon will take out the ""fatty pad"". I will go through chemo after surgery. But the waiting just feeds the fear and every pain I have, I think it's cancer coursing through my body. Two of my sisters did not survive cancer; one with breast, the other with ovarian. One of the highlights this week was finding out I didn't have ovarian! That was a HIGHLIGHT! My surgeon said that he doesn't lose patients to this disease and my survival rate is good. But I am just so scared they're going to find it everywhere and I won't make it. This is normal, right?

							Hi Loretta,
Fear is very much a part of this disease.  You'll have more emotions then you knew you had, but it's ""normal"".  I had no family history and the last thing I expected to hear was that I had breast cancer, stage III to boot.  

No one can make the decision for you and I'm not trying to, but have you considered having a mastectomy and just getting rid of all the breast and tissue in case there are cells lurking?  I was 43 when dx and I opted to have a mastectomy.  That was 2/14/02.  I opted to have the other breast removed and had that done 3/03.  I wanted to do everything humanly possible to increase my chances of beating this beast of a disease.  That was the right decision for me, not to say it is for you.  A lot of ladies with BC have lumpectomies and do great.

I'm so sorry for your losses.  I can't imagine how it feels to lose your sisters and then hear you have BC.  Try to remember that we are all individuals and all of our cancers are different based on our age, other health issues etc.

The waiting is the hardest.  My surgeon moved quickly, which is how I wanted it.  I was dx on a Thur. came to the city I've sense moved back to, saw the surgeon I knew I'd use on Monday and had the mastectomy and node disection Thur.  Three weeks after surgery, I met with my oncologist and a week later started chemo and then radiation followed.  Once the process gets started, then you know the end of treatment is getting closer too.

We're hear to help in anyway we can.

Hugs and prayers

							Hi Loretta!

I understand exactly where you are with the fear, uncertainty!  I was there in Dec 03--diagnosed on 12/8 and had surgery 12/18.  I had a lumpectomy with sentinel node biopsy also, and had one positive node.  I think that was the scariest news I ever got, even more so than the original diagnosis.  Both of my parents died of cancer--Dad from mets from lung cancer, and Mom from brain cancer.  Both were diagnosed as untreatable and Dad lived six weeks after diagnosis (that was 25 years ago) and Mom 5 months in 2002.  So you can see my experience with cancer was pretty much doom and gloom.  It took me several months to really convince myself on an emotional level (I knew it from an intellectual viewpoint from the start) that my case was different and that I really have a very good chance of beating this.  A coworker who is a long term bc survivor and the ladies on these boards helped tremendously.  14 months out I'm doing fine and nervous about my upcoming checkups next week!

I asked my surgeon before surgery if a mastectomy would provide a better prognosis if nodes proved to be positive, and he said it would not, it would just affect the post surgery treatment (I did chemo and radiation both), and that in fact odds were a little better with lumpectomy, although not statistically significant--as we all know statistics aren't meaningful to us as individuals anyway.

I'm praying for you for strength and support to get through the next few difficult months of decisions and treatment, and come out the other side healthier than ever and raring to go!  The fear never completely goes away for most of us, but it does get lots better and easier to handle.

							Loretta,

I was diagnosed in November 04 and I know what you are going through.  It's miserable knowing that there is cancer in your body.  All I wanted to do was to get treatment started.  Once you start, you feel like you regain some of the control because at least you are doing something.

It's very normal to be scared.  And every time you have a pain, you wonder if it's the cancer and it's moved.  That will get a bit better.  They will do all kinds of tests...bone scans, PET scans, MRIs and CTs...after a few tests that come back ok you will not worry so much.  I did have family history.  My mom had BC 9 years ago and is doing great.  Nancy has a point...you should consider a mastectomy with your history.  The surgeon really didn't give me the option of a lumpectomy because I already had node involvement, but immediately I asked about a simple mastectomy on the other side.  The surgeon said he thought that was reasonable considering my age (40) and history.  I decided to go ahead with it...I had no trouble at all making the decision, but it's something every woman has to decide for herself.  I am going to do reconstruction when I finish all the chemo and radiation.  My mom just had a mast. on one side and she has about a week's worth of worry every time she goes for a mammogram.  She told me if she had it to do over she would go ahead with a bilateral mast....and she's even considering having the other one done now.

Nancy....congrats on being NED!!!  Sorry I didn't say something sooner.  This is my ""good week"" and I've been out enjoying the beautiful weather and haven't spent a whole lot of time on my PC.  I know you have been worried about it and I hope your mind is eased now.  Enjoy the races!!

							First, thanks Shelly.  I pray we all have a long and healthy life with NED until his brother, CURE comes around 

This is where this disease is more confusing then even, different opinions from the docs.  My surgeon, who does more breast surgeries than any other here, told me that the overall survival rate is the same with a lumpectomy vs. mastectomy, however, there was a greater risk of a local reoccurence with a lumpectomy because there is no way to know what is lurking in the rest of the breast.  A local reoccurence of course is by far betting then a Stage IV reoccurence.  I personally couldn't see taking a chance of keeping my breast for the sake of having it, if the risks were higher that it would come back locally and end up having to have a mastectomy anyway and go through chemo once again.

I've had both removed so they aren't coming back.... lol  but I'd be curious in how the surgeon explained how a lumpectomy is better as far as reoccurences then a mastectomy.  I've never regretted my decision to have both breast removed and I had no family history, but since I was only 43, that put me at a higher risk because I was ""young"".

Most of the ladies I see now whether they have a lumpectomy or mastectomy still get chemo, just not as aggressively as a Stage II or III would, even if they are Stage I.  Most I know get 4 rounds of AC even with no node involvement.  Since there is no rhyme or reason to this disease, it can come back regardless of stage and node involvement just like it can never come back regardless of stage and node involvement.

							Hi,

My surgeon gave me the ""choice"" of lump or mast.  I chose the lump because I was wimpy about having a more major surgery done.  I also felt I could live with a good comfort level regarding that because I did not have a huge tumor.  Also, I was told that the long-term survival rate for lump vs. mast were the same.  I was told there was a slightly higher chance of local recurrence (in the breast) with the lumpectomy.  They advised I have chemo (4 A/C) because the tumor was larger than 1 centimeter and they felt it had been there for ""a while.""  I had never had a mammogram to use as a baseline.  I'm glad I had the chemo because when I think of that tumor sitting there for years.......

Well, we all have to do what we feel comfortable with -- what we can live with.

Hopefully, none of us will ever have to walk this path again.

							When my surgeon said numbers were slightly better for lumpectomy than mastectomy he was refering to long term survival--the big picture, and said the difference was so small as to not be significant--basically it was the same--mastectomy for early stage bc did not give a better prognosis than lumpectomy with radiation.  He speculated that maybe avoiding the major surgery may be easier on the body in general giving the immune system/healing mechanism more umph to fight the disease rather than the recovery from surgery--just his opinion.  I'm sure there are lots of things to take into account with each individual case, and every woman needs to make her own informed decision with her Dr's guidance.

							Hi Sharon,
I didn't have Taxol, but FEC instead, however I did have neurpathy.  I was given Neurotin.  It was mild throughout treatment, but if I remember correctly (thank God I'm starting to forget some of this journey), my plastic surgeon is that one that gave it to me, so mine must have gotten worse during the reconstruction attempt when I had so many complications.  I'd ask my onco about that if it's really bothering you.

I have heard some other ladies (that received 4 cycles) say that it took months after they competed their treatments for the neuropathy to stop.  Another one of those BC things where patience must prevail. Also, when I was considering a clinical trial with a Taxol arm, I read that chances of  permanent neuropathy were very low.  So sorry you have to endure this, though.  Two more treatments and you are done with this chemo stuff, FOREVER!

							It's L-Gluetamine, not glucosamine!  It comes in powdered form.  I forget how much I took, but I think I took it the first few days after each Taxol.  Some recommend taking it every day of chemo, no matter what sort of chemo.  Apparently, it can't hurt.  I cannot remember the dosage.  I'd do a Google search for more info.

I took it, although not religiously during taxol.  I had numbness on the very bottoms of my feet, and some fingernails were affected - dented looking and a few ""detached"" from the nail bed about halfway down.  The fingernails grew in normally after the taxol.  The numbness went away for me in about 4 months.  I don't know if it was the L-G, or just what my body does, but the L-G certainly didn't hurt.  You can get it at any vitamin/supplement store.

							Dear Shelly:   The Taxol is much better tolerated than the AC.  That is the good news.  There also doesn't seem to be the GI problems associated with the AC.  Everyone is different.  You might not experience any problems.  Apparently LGlutamine is good to take in addition to the B6 and B12.   Sharon

You should be looking for the ABCDs of skin cancer: 

Asymetry
 Asymmetry can be assessed by comparing one half of the growth to the other half to determine if the halves are equal in size. Unequal or asymmetric moles are suspicious.
Border
 If the mole's border is irregular, notched, scalloped, or indistinct, it is more likely to be cancerous (or precancerous) and is thus suspicious.
Color
Variation of color (e.g., more than one color or shade) within a mole is a suspicious finding. Different shades of browns, blues, reds, whites, and blacks are all concerning.
Diameter
Any mole that has a diameter larger than a pencil's eraser in size (> 6 mm) should be considered suspicious.

anyway, if you are not sure about a skin lesion, you should see a physicians.

							I have just started my third week of radiation after finishing 4 chemo treatments of A/C on Jan 5.  Over the weekend I noticed small bumps (hives) similar to a rash developing on the chest wall.  The breast is not red, dry, itching or tender and the bumps are not all over the breast but in a localized area.  The bumps are not red but do itch.  I've read that radiation can cause a rash but I guess I assumed that it would be more like a red rash, not raised bumps, and would cover more of the breast than just a small area.  Has anyone else had anything similar and any suggestions on what to do?  I continue to put lotions on the breast as radiologist suggest to keep it moist but wonder now if that could just be contributing to the problem.  Any ideas or suggestions?

I STOPPED USING ANY KIND OF LOTIONS OR CREAMS. JUST KEPT MYSELF CLEAN WITHOUT RUBBING HARD OVER THE BREAST. WITH A COUPLE DAYS OF STOPPING THE LOTION THE RASH WAS GONE AND DID NOT COME BACK. OTHERS THAT I TALKED TO DURING TREATMENTS WE USING THE LOTIONS AND HAVING LOT OF PROBLEMS WITH A RASH. I MUST SAY I NEVER TOLD THEM AT TREATMENT THAT I WAS NO LONGER USING THE LOTION. THEY DID MENTION TO ME HOW WELL MY SINK WAS DOING WITH NO RASH. THEY WERE REALLY SUPPRISE ABOUT THIS SINCE A AM A NATUREAL REDHEAD WITH VERY FAIR SKIN.

							Hello,
Sorry I did not check this forum earlier. Since it is Chinese New Year season, I have been pretty busy writing greeting cards and calling my parents.
Radiation dermatitis starts at approx. 3-4 weeks after the start of RT.  Usually it begins with erythema (redness) and patients may have rash or skin breakdown.  It is not usual to see itchy ""bumps"" while there is no skin change or other symptoms.
Since radiation dermatitis is a clinical diagnosis, you should talk to your radiation oncologists and ask him about it. Usually weekly on treatment examination is required, so please discuss with your physician this week.
Please let me know if you have any other questions.

							Dr. Leo,

I keep wondering why, when a patient who is at high risk but has never been diagnosed with bc and is on a ""wait and see"" schedule for periodic additional mammos or ultrasounds because something isn't quite obvious, the doctors don't just automatically order a CA 27.29 or CA 15-3 as one last check? Why aren't markers used more frequently in conjunction with imaging prior to diagnosis if they are comparatively so often used after treatment?

Pondering Again

AlaskaAngel
						

"

							AA ~ Until Dr. Leo responds......

Are you referring to the tumor marker blood tests?  I have read that they are not a good screening tool, but that they are more accurate when mets are involved.  Just guessing here from what I've read.

BTW...I'm a year out of treatment and just went for my follow-up in January at the rad onc and they still refuse to do any bloodwork.  None has been done since chemo.  I asked the nurse why none was done and she said there is nothing to look for.  I'm assuming that nothing shows up in early stage?  At any rate, I'll never have blood checked unless I have symptoms.  That is what they told me. 

Hugs,

Margie
						

"
"


							Yes, the markers for bc are the CA 27.29 and the CA 15-3. Your answer makes sense to me for the most part, except when I think about those women who end up being diagnosed in the first place with mets and who have said they had mammos for years without finding anything. The problem in that case is that basically mammos are used first rather than used routinely with ultrasounds. Therefore those women whose cancers only show up on ultrasounds are up the creek from the start, because unless they have something suspicious on mammo they are told ""all clear"", come back in a year....  I have ""heard"" that lobular usually is harder to find by mammo, for example.

I am wondering if you add that group in with the group of women who are known to be at high risk and then either routinely do both a mammo with an ultrasound for women every year in those groups... or if you at the very least throw a marker in with every mammo for these women (and then add the ultrasound if the marker is up), you might be able to catch a meaningful number of cancers with a good cost/benefit ratio. I wish I could do a study on it.

I'm sure it would have made a difference for me and I'm stage 1.
						

"
"


							Margie, I'm in the group that has some faith in markers, partly because I see enough cases where they have been meaningful. But don't let that sway you. However, having no blood tests at all unless you have symptoms is an entirely different matter to me. I know everyone's history is different, but tracking liver enzymes and CBCs on a regular basis for a bc survivor whether or not they have symptoms makes very good sense to me....

A.A.
						

"
"


							AA ~ It makes good sense to me, too.  I had invasive ductal, stage 1 and did the chemo and rads.  They just will not budge and do the bloodwork.

I do know that if I had mets I would want the tumor marker blood tests in cojunction with the scans.  I get irritated when I keep reading the earlier detection with mets does not affect survival time.  That MAY be true....I don't know.  However, some people just want to know as early as possible because maybe they want to make some changes in their life.  I think it has a lot to do with money.   I also think it's sad that some women with mets have had to ""fudge"" symptoms in order to get a scan to find out if they have brain mets.  Because.....aren't brain mets more treatable when discovered early?  Don't get me started on this....

							I work with a variety of docs and they consider blood testing as a part of any annual physical exam, but especially with anyone who has a chronic disease. I don't know why a health care provider would be reluctant, except some may have  a personal bias and tend to avoid ordering them for those who happen to be economically disadvantaged? 

I get aggravated too with the notion that finding out ""doesn't make a difference"" (perhaps to somebody ELSE it doesn't...) I understand that treating brain mets early can make a difference. 

I also do think that if we are willing to pay the full cost for any particular test we should be able to order it ourselves as often as we like.

Totally agree with you on this one! I haven't had health insurance since I got laid off and took care of my dad while he fought his losing battle with kidney cancer back in 2001.  Still, as a woman who is in her early 40's I paid every year for my annual exam and also for a mamo. Every year I was told all was good. I have invasive lobular carcinoma now. Diagnosed Sept 2004. I have 2 primary cancers, one in each breast. I am stage 3C in each breast with extensive nodal involvement. If I had known that not all breast cancers show up on a mamo I would have paid for the ultrasound too. Why do testing that only covers some of the group and not all of the group? I have told my 2 sisters to have both done and I tell everyone I meet to do the same. No one in the medical community that I have talked to agrees with me, they don't see the need for ultrasound screening unless there is a problem. Well, I just finished my 6th of 8 chemo treatments yesterday, then radiation tx, then hormone treatments and with all of that statistically I am still in the 50% 2 year survival rate, so I think I have a better perspective on the importance of these tests. 
Just my 2 cents worth.

							Welcome, JM.

One additional sad factor to keep in mind is that it is legally required that you be notified by the facility that provides the mammogram in regard to your mammogram results, but not for ultrasound results. So don't be lulled into thinking that no news is good news. Don't count on your health care provider to track it for you either (even though as the person who pays for the imaging you don't automatically get a copy).

							Am guessing she has DCIS (ductal carcinoma, in situr - which means in the ducts and in place.)  If has not gone beyond ducts they say it is non-invasive and easier to treat.  I have this.  I had lumpectomy (tiny calcifications taken out) and now doing a new radiation procedure which is only 5 days, start this tomorrow.  Sister may have opted for mastectomy though, which she can do and some do just to avoid more procedures.  If she is doing outpatient it is only lumpectomy.

If mastectomy others here will know more about than I

							Hi  Maria,

I'm so sorry your sister has been dx with breast cancer, but it sounds like it is early stage.   You didn't say whether it's invasive nor non-invasive.  Of course, it's preferable to have non-invasive but early-stage invasive has an excellent prognosis.

What can you do to help her?  Well, you're already helping her quite a bit just by going to be with her.  You can accompany her on any appointments she may have before and after her surgery.  Just being there for her (emotionally and/or physically) is a wonderful, caring thing and she's lucky to have a thoughtful sister.  

One of the best things you can do for her is to let her talk about her feelings as much as she needs to and be a good listener.  Sometimes during treatment we repeat things (over and over) because we just have to verbally ""get it all out"" because it is such a powerful experience.  I compare the powerful emotional impact to giving birth.  After giving birth, you want to talk about the experience with others.  The only difference is that giving birth is a happy experience whereas being diagnosed with breast cancer is, obviously, a sad and negative experience.

Another thing you can do (if she uses a computer) is give her the website  link and she could log on when she feels up to it.  It's really valuable to be able to share her feelings with others and receive support from women who have been there/done that.  Plus, if she has any questions she can receive excellent information from others.

Please keep us posted.  You and your sister are in my thoughts and prayers.

							Hi Maria, and welcome to the board. Sorry about your sister's diagnosis, but like other others have said, this sounds like it is really early, which is good. That's when cancer is most treatable and the prognosis for long-term survivial is best. I am sure your sister's surgery will go smoothly. Even with a mastectomy, an overnight stay is about all you get anymore if there are no complications. Regardless of whether she has lumpectomy or mast., she will get post-op care instructions and exercises to do to restore range of motion in her arm on the side where the surgery is done.
I know it feels like there is a lot of information to digest all at one time, and there really is. But, we will do our best to walk you through it all. Like Margie said, just being with your sister during this time is one of the best things you can do. She is going to need someone to listen to her and she reacts to this diagnosis. You are being a good friend to her by just listening. If you need additional information on Breast Cancer, there are some good links on this board, or you can try the American Cancer Society, the Susan G. Kohmen Foundation, Dr. Susan Love's or Imaginis.com Web sites.  If you are unable to find these sites, let me know and I will get you clickable links. Hugs, Lauri

One of the fastest ways to understand would be to go to a website like Mayoclinic.com and search under breast cancer. They have some pretty good explanations of what it is all about to help you and your sister. If you get stuck come back here and someone here will try to explain. Also there is a note on the top part of this screen that says ""NEW! Cancer Online - comprehensive cancer reference website"" and you might try seeing if that is helpful.

							I had a Thyroidectomy for Graves disease last Feb. Upon routine pathology they found Non Hodgkins Lymphoma. It was just localized in the Thyroid. I am tested every 3 months with blood tests. They tell me this will return sometime and somewhere. Now my spleen is enlarging but they do not think this is the Lymphoma returning. I am scheduled for another CT scan in 3 months. Anyone else have this type of condition?

							Hello,

Although most lymphoma cases are treatable, their treatments differ and depend on the typs of the NHL and the stage. If the disease is limited to your thyroid only and no metastasis is found in adjacent nodes or other distant organs, it is an early stage NHL.  The treatment after surgery depends on the pathology. Is your disease a low grade NHL or a large B cell type?

							Hi Friends,

I was just wondering what everyone ""takes"" if you don't mind sharing this information?  ""Inquiring minds"" wanna know!  LOL

This is what I take:

10 mg. Tamoxifen, twice daily - I've been so lucky...the only side effect I've had is hot flashes and they've diminished quite a bit.

70 mg. Fosamax, once a week.  I started on Actonel a year before I was dx with BC.  My PCP did this as a preventive measure.  I had no side effects.  Then,  I received a letter from my insurance company stating they would no longer compensate me for that drug.  Their alternative was Fosamax, so I switched.  Again...very lucky...no side effects at all.  And I've known women who have had serious gastrointestinal side effects.

750 mg. Glucosamine, daily

600 mg. Chondroitin, daily

10 mg. Ambien, at bedtime.  When I was dx I was prescribed Ativan at bedtime (low-dose .5 mg.) and stayed on that for a while.  Then my PCP had me try Trazadone (100 mg.)  I had to stop taking it because it caused extreme dry mouth.  The good thing about that was the fact that it's non-addictive.  And now, the Ambien doesn't seem to be working.    This has been my biggest problem.....trying to get a good nights sleep.  Anyone else have trouble sleeping?

Thanks for sharing.

I can't seem to get them to give me anything to help me sleep.  I keep asking and they keep telling me to try Benedryl.  I know Benedryl will help me sleep but it also helps with my allergies and I don't want to diminish it's effectiveness in that regard.

							Hi Margie, I did five years of Tamoxifen, so that is behind me. However, I have an underactive thyroid, so I take Synthroid -- started at .1 mg now up to .125. My PCP has me on 70 mg of Fosomax for bone density, Wellburtirn for depression, at 25 mg diuretic (HCTZ) to help with slightly elevated blood pressure and Lipitor for my cholesterol. I am supposed to be taking 1200 mg of calcium + Vit. D daily but I seldom remember. I try to remember to take an aspirin and a multi-vitamin daily, too. I have tried Glucosamine Condroiten but did not see any improvement in my arthritis. When I remember, I try to take a fish oil capsule each day. I really need to organize all the pills into one of those daily reminder boxes so I don't forget to take them. Lauri

							My psa #s have been all over the place ranging from 1.8 to 4.1
I have no symptons of prostate cancer and had a biopsy 4 years which came back negative. During my annual checkup during the DRE portion
the doc said my prostate was larger on one side and my psa number doubled over last year. I've been more sexually active lately and am wondering if the enlargement is due to increased sexual activity.
Is it true that increased testosterone is like putting gas on an open fire when it comes to prostate cancer...i.e. the numbers go up.
Does this mean in order to keep the numbers down and reduce the prostate I should cut back on sex? I'm 58, 145, and in excellent health, low cholesterol numbers, no family history etc., but these psa numbers and enlargement have me freaked out. any ideas?

PSA doubling time of just a year is cause for concern.

I suspect that there is a nodule on one side of the prostate, which would be what the medic refers to.

Another biopsy is in order.

>I've been more sexually active lately and am wondering if the >enlargement is due to increased sexual activity.

Unlikely to the point of impossible, IMO.

>Is it true that increased testosterone is like putting gas on an open fire >when it comes to prostate cancer...i.e. the numbers go up.

What numbers? It is true that testosterone tends to encourage the growth of PCa cells.

>Does this mean in order to keep the numbers down and reduce the >prostate I should cut back on sex?

I don't believe that sexual activity has anything to do with PCa.

 I'm 58, 145, and in excellent health, low cholesterol numbers, no family history etc., but these psa numbers and enlargement have me freaked out. any ideas?


Yes. Have another biopsy.

Um, that would be *increase* the PSA score. If the uro really said ""lower"", he's dangerously ignorant.

To be on the safe side, I'd recommend 48 hours. C'mon, you can do it  

And avoid anything else that could stress the prostate. This includes a DRE, biopsy, even, some say, bike riding.

Nope.

Just saying that it's best to avoid any activity that stresses the prostate -- including slap & tickle -- for 48 hours prior to the blood draw. 

Any such stress will temporarily *increase* the PSA score.

He had no trouble getting tube in.  So now Fri see radiologist again, and then staying in Indianapolis for 5 days for the treatment and that's it.

Those of you that know me I was in a car accident the 8th of Jan 05 and I have Implants due to reconstruction from BC, well the seat belt did it's job and held me tight, So tight that is ripped my implant out of it's place. Now when these are put in your chest they are sewen in a pocket into the chest wall, well that is what ripped.
When I lay on my back my Implant lays down along on my side, there is pain along with that.

I am a survivor of Hodgkins. They found it when I was 21. It was in 1972 and I was in a guinea pig program. It is hard to cope with all you go through, but you have to look at it as a learning experience. I have found that over the years I have insights into things that other people miss. I also learned that I notice a lot of thingsthat are not important to other people. For instance how wonderful a sunrise is. Or how important every minute of life is and how long a minute is. There is a lot in life that people don't see that have never beenfaced with there own mortality. In a way we are blessed for getting a wake up call to appreciate all of life. Every second we are alive is a beautiful thing. The older I ge the more I appreciate it. I have gotten to meet my granchildren, who I never thought I would ever see. I got to see my children grow up. I am looking forward to meeting my greatgrandchildren someday. All we can do is enjoy what time we have on this earth. 
Good luck with all your life.

I was too old for the childrens ward at the hospital i was treated at so they put me in a ward with dieing old men,i was the only teen there,and death was a daily occurance.
I spent 3mnths in that ward,i even overheard one of the nurses refer to it as the death ward. Im sure i suffered post traumatic stress or some form of shock.When i was first diognosed, i was told in no uncertain terms that i was suffering from a terminal cancer and that i would be dead within 6mnths,in some ways i am glad that i was told in the way i was,with my crying mother sitting beside me i became very angry and determined to beat it, i only had the one course of chemo [6 lots] dont know the type but i was allergic to maxalon and stemital,the main two anti neasea meds they had back then,so i was allways sick after chemo.
Anyway after the last chemo,the tumors dissappeared,the docs/proffs were so amazed that they wanted to operate to see where it had gone,about a month after chemo i agreed to surgery/lapendectomy, all they found was scarring where the mass of tumors had been.
 I have had relapses since and am battling one at the moment,but im past worrying now,whatever will be,will be.
   Best wishes to all,,Jim Atkins, Australia.

							Hi,
I was diagnosed with Stage IIIB Hodgkin's Lymphoma when I was 18. Now I'm 19...CANCER FREE! The following is my testimony that I had written during chemo. I hope it will encourage you. You're not alone out there, stay strong...you've overcome something that defines something of you character...not a quitter! Please excuse the dates as I wrote them over a year ago.

                As most of you know, on June 21st of this year I was diagnosed with Stage III Hodgkin�s Lymphoma, (cancer).  The news came to me as a shock.  It hit me hard when my mom was crying and told me that I had cancer.  I found myself at a loss of words.  The unthinkable had turned to reality.
	I was at my friend�s house when my mom told me so I immediately left.  I went home straight to the internet and began to read information and statistics on this particular disease.  It said, �In 2005, approximately 7,350 new cases of Hodgkin�s Lymphoma will be diagnosed and 1,410 Americans will die from the disease.�  I kept thinking to myself, �Will I be a part of that 1,410?� �Will I die?�  In between all the confusion and nonstop negative thoughts that ran through my head, my brother called.  He spoke in a clear and distinct tone, reassuring me that everything was gonna be okay.  Most importantly, he told me that God was in control.  That the existence of cancer in my body, the chance of survival, the �what if-s�, and all the negative ideas that follow cancer should NOT matter at all.  He told me hey you�ve got Christ on your side, that�s ALL you need.  At that point in time thoughts just kept racing in my head, but I had a sort of comfort that took over�the comfort that doesn�t come from man.  The comfort, that doesn�t have a price tag on it.  I had Christ.  The Holy Spirit was present in me.  The power of God embraced me and gave me comfort and assurance.
	The following week or so was intense.  We had to schedule appointments left and right and at the same time accept the fact that I had cancer.  At the consultation with the oncologist, the doctor explained to me thoroughly about the disease and the treatment that he would like to use, which was A.B.V.D. Chemotherapy.  To start the chemo I had to undergo a few tests to see the extent and severity of the disease, and also my body�s condition.  I had to have a bone marrow biopsy to see if the disease had spread into the bone marrow and blood, an echocardiogram to see if my heart was okay, a P.E.T. scan to reveal the extent of the disease, and they had to surgically implant a porticath or catheter in my chest where I would receive the chemo.  The prayers were ongoing.  At the next doctor visit if I�m not mistaken was already the first answered prayer.  The doctor told me that the echocardiogram turned out good and that my heart was ok, which was good.  The P.E.T. scan was a bummer because it revealed that the disease was spread to both sides of my neck, both armpits, an 17-cm tumor in front of my heart, and a final tumor in my abdomen.  Although it seemed as though it was a bummer, it wasn�t really.  God knew about this and He had it all planned out.  Next was the bone marrow biopsy, which was sent off to City of Hope, a cancer specialty center, so we had to wait for the results.  God�s next answer to our prayer came at the next doctor visit.  The doctor told me that the disease was NOT spread to the bone marrow, which made my chance of survival even greater.  God was definitely working in my life.  Although I didn�t know what his plan was for me, I knew that I was in His truly amazing care.  I was constantly reminded of Proverbs 3:5-6, which says, �Trust in the Lord with all thine heart and lean not on your own understanding.  In all thy ways acknowledge Him and He shall direct thy paths.�  God works in mysterious ways.  Sometimes we don�t know what His purpose is, but all we have to do is to simply trust in Him.
It was at that point that the doctor issued my treatment and told me that I was to undergo 6 months of chemo (once every two weeks) to thoroughly cure the disease.  Well I have been through 4 treatments (2 months) going on to my fifth this Friday.  The treatments surprisingly don�t affect me too much.  Yes, at times there�s the occasional exhaustion that comes with it, but it�s all good.  God�s been taking care of me immensely during this time.  Yesterday I had to do a follow up P.E.T. scan to see if there was any progress.  Just a few hours ago my oncologist called me to let me know the results.  A little nervous at first he asked me, �Armond, are you ready for this?�  I didn�t know whether it would be good or bad so I answered, �Yes� with a scared tone.  He said, �Ok�.Well�.The cancer�s gone!�  To my disbelief I asked him if he was serious and sure enough he was.  Praise the Lord the cancer�s out, it�s gone, yet I�ll still be continuing the chemo for a few more months to fully rid my body of the remaining cells that might not be detected.  I would like to thank you all for your constant prayer and support that you provide.  I would appreciate if you would keep praying for me as I�ll have just a little bit more to go.
I would just like to encourage everyone to commit yourselves to the Lord for his love endures forever.  These few verses have been an encouragement to me.  I�m sure they will be of aid to you too.  �Rejoice in the Lord always.  I will say it again: Rejoice!  Let your gentleness be evident to all.  The Lord is near.  Do not be anxious about anything, but in everything, by prayer and petition, with thanksgiving, present your requests to God. And the peace of God, which transcends all understanding will guard your hearts and your minds in Christ Jesus.� Phillippians 4:4

Glory be to our Lord and Savior Jesus Christ. 




	To update everyone on my journey with cancer:  When I wrote my testimony above, I was only two months into the entire chemo process (August 30, 2005).  Thanks to all of your prayers and God�s grace and mercy, I completed the treatment last Friday (December 9, 2005).  I will undergo a few weeks of radiation therapy to cease the replication or presence of remaining cells that are undetected with scans.  Lord-Willing this process will be as non-discomforting as the chemotherapy.  God watched over me then and with faithful prayer I am confidant that He will do as He promised.  (�And the prayer of faith shall save the sick, and the Lord shall raise him up� -James 5:15a)

							Hi,
Just wanted to let anyone that's a Nascar fan know that www.racefansforacure.com is selling all their stuff for 50% off and ALL of the sales go to Komen.  I've got quite a few of the things over the last few years and they are really nice.  You'll have to click on donation to see the items, or that's how it use to be.

For those who have seen it on the national news, there was a 17 year old that killed his mother, on the street that the houses on my street back yards meet.  They did catch him in VA and he'll be coming back to pay the piper. It brought back some pretty bad memories of the abusive jerk I was married to, but I'll be ok.  Just glad they caught him.  I wasn't leaving my house until they did.

Hugs to all and I'm getting my act together.  Hopefully after my check up on the 14th, that will relieve alot of the extra anxiety, as long as it's good news of course.

Talk to everyone soon

							I had a question about the connection of cancer and genetics.
I had an argument with a friend the other day about if cancer is genetic of not in certain instances. A few things that came up were that if say your grandmother and her mother had cancer but both different types and then you her grandchild got cancer is that genetically related? I always thought it had to be the same kind of cancer. Also if there is alot of cancer that runs through you family does this mean you are more likely to get cancer some time in your life??

Thanks a bunch!!

							Hi Emily - i'll be interested in the doctors' replies also. I have breast cancer, my twin brother died of brain cancer and my Dad of colon cancer.My Dad was one of 8 siblings, and all but one died of some kind of cancer.   My Oncologist told me that brain cancer is never genetic, but because I have Crohn's too, I am at high risk for colon cancer so am checked regularly by colonoscopy. As far as I have been told, different cancers do not mean you will have a genetic presdisposition. We'll see what info Dr. Leo has.

							Hello

There are certain that may be familial. Breast cancer is one of them, but most cases are sporadic. Still, there are many syndromes such as Li Fraumeni Syndrome, that predispose people to have cancer. Still, having different types of cancers affecting family members does not necessarily mean that these are not related.

All cancers are different, but some genetic defects predispose people to developd a group of cancers. There is one syndrome called Hereditary Non-Polyposis Colon Cancer (HNPCC) that may cause several different cancers.

							I have an uncle who has been hospitalized with sever headaches and vision problems.  They have been running tests for about 2 1/2 weeks now.  Anyway...to make a long story short, they are now 95% sure that he has lymphoma.  He had a spot on his lung that they did a biopsy of.  

He has spots on his lung, liver, and behind his eyes in his brain.  My question is...Is this treatable or is it something that is not good?  Knowing what I know about cancer, I'm assuming since it was found in so many areas that it's not good.  Another question...At first they thought this was lung cancer, is it better that it has turned out to be lymphoma?  

He is 75 years old so right now their main focus is treating for the head pain and vision problems that have occurred as a result of this.  Thanks for any help!!

Hi Everyone,

So far the doctor doesn't know what it is.  I've been having back pain for 2 years and thought it was a back injury from work.  Now I find out that there is this HUGE tumor on my back.  It starts at just under the shoulder blades directly on my spine.  It continues down and disappears into my buttock region.  It is about 6 inches across.  The edges are not easily defined.  It is of a gelatinous consistency as if it were fat, but its not fat.  It even shows up on a regular MRI as fat.  We haven't done a deferential MRI yet.  

Anyway, from everything I have read in trying to research this, it isn't sounding good.  You wouldn't even know that it was there unless you knew to look for it.  6 different doctors over the past 2 years have looked at it and didn't even see it, because they weren't looking for a tumor.  It doesn't protrude from the body.  Yet it covers the whole spine where it is.  The doctors forgot when looking at my back that you are supposed to be able to see the spine no matter how big someone is.  It is like the spine is the defining middle point of the body, yet from just below the shoulder blades my is missing upon first inspection.

Literature says that because it does not hurt, (except to cause spasms in the surrounding muscles) and because it isn't easily defined that it is probably some type of cancer.  

Has anyone else seen something like this?  I have been trying to find a description on what it might be, but can't find anything.  It is not a lipoma.  That has already been ruled out.  I am scared.  I do not know what all damage it is doing.  I know that my back muscles are weaker.  Anyway, need some feed back.

Thank you

							Dear Indiglo

Thanks for your post and sorry to hear about this. Have you had any type of biopsy to sort it out ? This can be a tumor originating from the bones, or even from the soft tissues. But it is hard to tell what it is, and it certainly sounds like you will need some form of diagnostic procedure such as a biopsy.

best regards,
Leo

]Hi, thank you for getting back to me.  No, I have not had a biopsy.  It is my opinion that a biopsy would spread the cancer, if it is cancer.    I have read that a ""Ultrsound"" is just as accurate at finding out if it is cancer or not.  

But, again, no.  I have not had an Ultrasound done yet either.  I literally just found out at the end of December that this tumor is what is causing my back pain.  I have seen another Doctor in the meantime.  He feels it is ""crazy"" that no one has seen it before.  He has ordered the regular MRI scan images.  I imagine that he will order a diferrential MRI when he finds out that this tumor doesn't show up on the regular one as anything unusual.    At least for the doctor that has seen it.  I actually got my hands on the MRI report and it doesn't even mention it.  

And, (sorry, I do not remember if I mentioned this) there is another tumor on my hip.  I am about 60 pounds overwieght, so I never really thought about it before.    I know that I noticed it about 2 years ago.  At that time it was just a strange lump under the fat.  (I'm tall and have a large bone structure, so being 60 pounds over wieght doesn't really look that bad on me.)  

It started in a spot where I get shots for my migraines, so I just thought it was scar tissue. (Since I have Fibromyalgia, I thought it possibly could be an overgraowth of scar tissue)  But, now the surface area of the tumor there on my hip is the size of my entire hand.  And, I don't care how small someone's hand is, for a tumor that is HUGE.  So, this one is really huge too.  I thought it could possible be a metastisized piece of the other tumor on my back, but they are not the same consistency.  The tumor on my hip doesn't hurt either.  The skin covering it hurts when I put too much pressure on it, but the tumor is completely without feeling.  Which I hear is very bad.

I'm otherwise healthy.  I do not have swollen lymph glands.  I do not get sick very often.  I had the flu 2 years ago and that was the last time I can really remember being sick.  Before that it was even longer, except I remember having a cold or 2 before that.  I do not even remember having a cold for the last 2 years.  

I am studying to be a Master Herbalist and I am already a Natural Health Consultant.  So, I take good care of myself.  I have started drinking pomegranate juice and have been drinking 6 to 8 cups of green tea everyday for years.  Maybe that is what kept the tumor from causing other symptoms, like getting sick all the time.  And, the Fibromyalgia would cover up any tiredness that I may have been having.

Sorry, here I am just running on.  Just wanted to give you a better picture.

							Hello

Sorry about your loss. Lung cancer can be cured if caught early, and prognosis depends largely on how disseminated the disease is. If it is too advanced for surgery, the prognosis is not very good, maybe a couple of years on average.

regards,
leo
						

"
"


							I agree, the prognosis depends on the stage of the disease.  

There are three important factors for prognosis of non-small cell lung cancers (adenocarcinoma is one type of NSCLC): stage, weight loss, and performance status.

For patients with stage I disease and can have surgery, the 5 year survival is between 50-70%; for stage II, overall surv rate is about 30-50%; for stage III is between 10-15%; and stage IV 5%.

Of course a pt's prognosis is more complex than just these numbers, other factors like type of treatment and whether or not the pt can tolerate adjuvant treatment esp. chemotherapy are also important.

I want so much to come on here and post NED, exactly 3 years on Monday

							It was hard to find out after going through treatment just how long it takes to be able to have enough endurance to get going again with exercise. For me it was about a year and a half, which translated to over 2 years after diagnosis. 

It was very educational to learn just how fast we go to pot when we are taking a beating from treatment. I have a lot more sympathy for other people than I used to. 

I love to snowshoe too -- much better than skiing (we only have cross-country here as the nearest commercial skiing is hundreds of miles away and might as well be on the moon) -- although ice skating is my newest sport and I just wish we had good ice on the lakes more often...

							Hi Shelly,
I honestly had no problem with have both breast removed (just wish I had done it at the same time) but when my hair started coming out......psycho woman emerged....  Mine didn't start coming out until right before my 4th round of FEC.  The nurses looked up the chemos to see if there was a small % that didn't lose all their hair and there was but only on 1 of them, but I convenienced myself, I wasn't going to lose it.  My dad happened to be at my house when I went to the bathroom to brush it and I felt so sorry for him.  I didn't just cry, I was squalling and cussing the disease and pretty much had a meltdown.  I'd say within a few days or a week, I accepted it as it was, gone.  I wasn't smart like you and had it cut off.  I had 3 haircuts before chemo, so my hair went from 1/2 way down my back to right under my ears, but let it come out at it's own speed (fast).  I found a sweather hanging in the closet when I was moving and it was clean, but had alot of strands of my hair on the inside of it.  BUT now it's back to half way down my back and hard to believe I ever lost it.....my hair not my mind, that's a given... lol

							What is the significance of PR and HER2 status? My pathology report only stated my ER status, +.  I was grade and stage 2 invasivd ductal, with 3/18 + nodes. Does PR and HER2 affect my prognosis? Many thanks.
						

"

							Hi,
 Being er + is a good thing.  That means that you are able to take Tamoxifen or Arimidex or one of the other drugs that work when your cancer feeds off hormones.
You want to be Her2 negative, but if you're positive that doesn't mean that the cancer is going to come back.
I'd call your onco or surgeon tomorrow and ask him what your pr and Her2 status are.  If you're going to see him/her this week, then I'd ask when you got there and he could explain what the Her2 is in alot more detail that I could because I'm Her2 negative.

							Just came from my 2nd chemo treatment.  I also saw my oncologist and he brought up something that I'd not heard before and my brain was apparently on vacation so I didn't think to ask about it.

Here's the deal...I had MRM on the right and a simple mast with SN on the left.   I was told that nothing showed up on the left side either in the breast or the SN.  Today, my doctor said that there was another test run after the biopsy....said he wasn't sure why because it's not commonly done....anyway he said there was ""staining"" which indicated there were cancer cells there.  He did say that they were not able to be seen with a microscope or they would have been picked up in the biopsy.  So my question is...will the chemo take care of these cells or is there something else I should be doing?  Should radiation be considered for this side as well?  What exactly does this mean to me?

I'm going to dig out my path report and find out exactly what he is talking about...if I can figure the stupid thing out.  Thanks for any info you can give me.

							Hi Shelly,
It will be interesting to hear what the good doc's say.  I just thought I would share something that happened to me...
I was in the Sental node biopsy study which was to show that they could pick up the first few nodes and have better results than first removing all the nodes (which was standard of care).  I got on the arm that they would do the sental node and if any came back positive (discovered during the surgery) they would remove the rest right then and there.  
Well my surgery went well with no positive nodes out of 3.  Then a week later I get a call saying that when the lab was doing the permanent slides they discovered that one was POSITIVE.. so back in I went for more to be removed (I think 11 or 15) which all were negative..thank goodness!!
But, I can't help but wonder if other women gone through the sental node dissection with negative nodes, may have had positive nodes like me.
In your case are they talking about lymph nodes which came back postive the second time around like me???

Call the office tomorrow so they can put your mind at ease. Your oncologist will call you and should go over what this means.  I would think the chemo would get it on that side.  Let me know what the doc says. hollis

							Dear Shelly,
Sorry I cannot provide you with any recommendations since we need to perform medical history and physical examinations before recommending any treatment.
Usually, radiation can be used for patients with 4 or more axillary lymph nodes or with other unfavorable prognostic factors. There is no definite recommenation for radiating the chest wall or not, but radiation may decrease local recurrence or even improve survival for certain patients with less than 4 nodes in the ipsilateral axilla. 
Chemotherapy is usually recommended for patients with locally advanced (3 nodes is not that advanced) and/or poorly differentiated breast ca. 
Now for your case, I highly recommend you to talk to the medical oncologist again. You may want to ask him whether radiation is indicated or not and why. If you are not happy with the answer, ask for an consultation after chemotherpy is completed. RT is usually given after chemo unless the surgical margins were positive or close.
Good luck,

							I'm just curious.  Why does everyone sound like people like myself with many positive nodes, don't have much of a chance?  I know it's better not to have them, but there are many ladies that are many years out with alot of node involvement.  I guess it's hard to hear over and over again about ""poor prognosis"".  I just became officially 3 years NED with Stage III and I think I'm doing good as does my onco.

"


							Nancy ~ I don't think that because we all know this is a very sneaky disease.  

One ladie's doctor told her that even if it is in the nodes that it does not mean that it has actually travelled from the nodes and survived somewhere in the body to set up shop.  And, if it did travel, your immune system possibly could kill those cells. Or, they could lie dormant for many, many years and never wake up.  We all hear stories of women with lots of positive nodes doing GREAT many years later and women with no positive nodes and other ""good"" prognostic factors who have a recurrence at a later date.

ENJOY YOUR NED!

							Hello

This is an interesting report. But it can happen, as the stains are done on different ""cuts"" from the tissue. So the cells can be seen in one section but not in the other. 

So As Dr. Lu suggested, you should talk to your oncologist to see if you need more surgery/chemo or even radiation.

							I'm new to the site today, and just returned from my doctor's office.  Had a mammo a couple weeks ago and was told today that I have calcifications in the left breast.  Can someone tell me what this is?  They are scheduling me for a different kind of mammo to follow up. What can I expect to happen regarding the calcifications?

Couldn't help but notice your name, BAMAGIRL..... I'm in Alabama, are you or a fan of BAMA football?

As far as calcifications go, and I'm no expert on them by any means, I think if they cluster, they will remove them because some can become or are breast cancer.  It sounds like you're in good hands and that the docs are making sure exactly what they are looking at on the mammogram.  My mammogram missed a 5.5 cm tumor, so I'm glad when someone's picks up something because IF and it's a big IF, it is BC, it is being caught real early which is great!!!.

Keep us posted

							Hi Tina, welcome to the board. So glad you found a support source at this time. Here is a good web site with information on calfications. They appear like little specks on the mammogram, and when fine calcificiations are clustered together, the can indicate the presence of cancer. But, NOT ALWAYS. I had micro-calcifications under my lumpectomy incision, but there was no cancer. Anyway, you are on the right path in getting additional diagnostic tests done. Keep us posted on how you are doing and what you find out. Do not hesitate to bring your questions here. Either of the docs or one of the board members is likely to have a good answer for you. In the meantime, do check out the Imaginis Web site. It has lots of good information. Good luck. Lauri

							I've had two excisional biopsies for calcifications.  They are not cancer.  They are dead cells that calcify.  This can happen for many reasons.  However, if the calcifications are in a clump or linear (like in a duct), they are considered suspicious for cancer.  That is when they want further tests.  Both of mine were suspicious, and both were not cancer.  Actually, when I WAS diagnosed with cancer, I had no calcifications, just a lump.

							Hi ladies,
Thank you for your replies to my post last week.  Being able to share your concerns with others who have had the same experiences is such a blessing!  I got really frustrated this morning.  I had my follow-up mammo scheduled for this morning and when I got there, they said they did NOT have me scheduled and wanted me to wait for three weeks - when I got home I called central scheduling and they were able to re-schedule me for next week.

Nancy, in response to your question - I lived in Alabama for 25 years before I moved to Florida in June 2002.  I lived in Tuscaloosa for several years when growing up and was able to attend many, many Bama games (this was during the Namath/Stabler era) due to my father's job with the newspaper.  I still think there is no other college football except Bama.

							I had 10 nodes removed on 1/25/05.   No one provided any exercises for me; therefore, I developed my own after researching the web.

I do two exercises only, but do both three times every day, 5 repetitions, and holding each stretch for 20 seconds.   The first exercise is my fingers walking up the wall to the point of pain greater than 4/10, and then holding.    The second is putting my hand behind my neck and extending my elbow.   I do the exercise with both arms at the same time to prevent cheating and to establish goals for my right arm.

Initially, while exercising, I had pain extending down the side of my right chest, under my right upper arm, and on top of my right forearm with even minimal stretching.  I also had a burning type pain where the incision was which was constant (whether I was exercising or not).

I take no pain medication; nor do I apply heat or cold.   
I can now extend my hand to the top of the door frame, and do the second exercise with hand behind neck/elbows extended.

The pain has gone away from the side of my right chest completely.   
 However, when I extend the stretch the pain is still felt under my upper arm, and on top of my forearm.  This area is also very tender to touch.
The burning under my arm where the incision was has diminished somewhat; being worse in the evening/night.

Can you think of any suggestions for me?    Any other exercises?    Do I sound as if I am progressing?  Do the symptoms I describe sound normal?   

Thank you for your help in advance:

							Sounds like you are doing just fine. Shame on your doctor for not sending you home with exercises to do, however. Wall crawling is one of the best to restore range of motion. It sounds like you are progressing well. If your doctor does not have some standard exercises, try your branch of the American Cancer Society. They have a Reach for Recovery program, and I would think they would offer some exercises. I'll see if I can find some on-line sites with more information. It's been so long since I had my surgery, I have forgotten just what I did. But, I do remember walking my fingers up the wall. Like you I had little discomfort, which surprised me. Glad you are feeling well. Hugs, Lauri

							Hi Susan, sorry to read about your brother Dave. My twin brother died at 50 yrs of a brain tumour - I don't know what type as he did not like to talk about it, always thought he would get well. For the last week of his life he was bed bound and slept most of the time probably because he was on diamorphine. The end was very peaceful - it was as if he just went to sleep again but didn't wake up. A local McMillan cancer nurse attended daily and the local GP also came in daily. They were going to move him into hospice but he died before the arrangements could be made. He was in no pain - the doctor made sure of that. I hope your brother is kept as comfortable as Bill was. My love and thoughts are with you at this terrible time.

							My grandmother died a little over 4 years ago from a stage 4 of some form of brain cancer. You asked about the end, and with my grandmother that was pretty much all we had. 
They found a mass on a CAT scan and within the next week biospied it. The biopsy was all the treatment she ever had, because she never really came out of a coma after that. We had another 6 weeks with her, but they were all comatos days. 
Our situation was a little different because of the coma, but we as a family decided not to have nutrients given to her via IV. In the end it was that her body simply failed her, but her mind was already gone. I was only 17 at the time so I don't know what her vitals were like, but she slowly wasted away. Because she was getting no nutrients she lost all the weight she ever had, as well as her muscle. Then one day the nurses called to tell us that we needed to get there soon. The end is different for everyone, but I firmly believe that while a death is a sad, devastating time, it can also be seen as a relief for the sick party. 
My grandfather, on the same side has been suffering from leukemia for 10 years and now has non-hodgkin's lymphoma and as much as I'm going to miss him I know that he will finally be able to rest and not be sick anymore. 

I'm sorry to hear about your brother and wish you all luck.

							I am sorry to hear about your brother --  this disease is devastating, but I will share with you because I have been their first hand and I wanted to know as well. 

My mother was diagnosed with a GBM IV which was inoperable and quite large - right parietal lobe.   The only treatment she had was a biopsy for diagnosis -- she turned down chemo and radiation because it would not cure her and she was afraid of suffering.   She was in the hospital for 2 weeks and then send home with hospice (which was marginal).  Doctors told us 3-6 months -- she lived another 10 days at home.  Her ending was not peaceful -- she was in constant pain from bowel cramps, was restless, had to urinate many times a day -- she was unable to walk around and spent every day in bed -- getting up only to be led to bathroom and back.   Eventually she could not walk -- she did not become sleepier and sleepier as the doctors told me she would.   She had twitchy legs, cold feet and was scared.   A few days before she died, I believe her sight was a problem -- she could see things, but could not interpret what she saw.  She remained lucid and reasonable, however, until the end -- some short term memory loss.   She cried and said she wanted to die.   She continued to eat small portions and asked for food and drink.  I asked the hospice nurse who came maybe 2x/week  if she thought she was near the end.   They said not yet.   She will stop eating altogether and sleep more.   Guess what?  They were wrong.   On the night before she died I noticed that she was snoring as she slept -- my mother never snored.   I left to go home at midnight and at 4AM the aide we had hired to sit through the night with her screamed and woke my sister who was there.   They thought my mother was vomiting, but nothing came out.  They sat her up, she said ""Oh dear God"" and was unconscious -- she never woke up and died later that morning.   I believe from the description of what happened, that her tumor hemmorhaged and she died of a massive stroke, but no one ever confirmed that fact.  It was awful.....my heart goes out to anyone having to deal with this disease -- it is terrible, buy although I did not want my mother to die, her suffering and deterioration were horrible to watch.   At least she is no longer suffering.  It has been 7 months since she died and many of the awful things I had to go through are still very painful memories.   I thought I would never feel good again, but I am finally starting to feel better.   I would obsess and relive her terrible death and cry every day for almost two months, but now I am able to cope.   Good luck -- it is not an easy time.

							Hello,
I was diagnosed Oct. 1, 2004 with breast cancer, I had bi-lateral mastectomy and have went through 4 A/C treatments and today I'm going for my 3rd of four taxol treatments. Since the second treatment, I have this itching, feels like pins and needles, nvery bothersome.  I'm taking the meth pack and benadryl every four hours and it is barely keeping it away.  Has anyone else out there had this side effect?  If so, I was wondering if they are going to change my treatment.  I just want it to all be over with, but don't think I can take this for another month.

This is a really nice place to hang out, and we've got some real experts, Dr. Leo and Dr. Jay, who are available. In addition, you will find people here at all ages and stages of treatment and recovery. I did not have chemo, so I cannot address you problems from personal experience. But, from what i have heard from others, neuropathy is a common problem with Taxol. The pins and needles feelings are probably related to that. I would certainly talk to your onc. about the discomfort. Perhaps there is another drug they can give you that would offer some relief to get you through those last treatments. Maybe someone else on the board has another sugguestion. Good luck. And, please keep us posted on how you are doing. Feel free to jump into any discussion. Your views are always welcome. If you have not, please take a moment to find our roll call post and add your name. It is a great place to learn about who is here. Hugs, Lauri

							my mom just found out yesterday that she had breast cancer.  They removed an egg sized tumor from one of her breast monday and she got the news yesterday that it was malignant.  She goes to the hospital next wednesday for surgery.  They said they were going to remove the lining of her breast and check her lymph nodes to see if the cancer had spread to them yet.  Then she has to take twenty some radiation treatments and possibly chemo.  By this scenario can anyone tell me if this is bad or have they caught it early enough to get rid of it.

							Good luck to your mom.  It sounds like they are doing what needs to be done.  If the tumor was contained with no lymph node involvement...that would be better.  Are they going to check all the lymph nodes or do a sentinal node biopsy?  Just know that whatever happens, there are lots of people here with lots of info...so as any questions arise, just post them and someone will be along to answer.

I am currently having chemo and will be beginning radiation in April, and will then be on Tamoxifen for 5 years.   I'll be glad to answer any questions about that as well as the surgeries that I've had...they are listed at the bottom of this post in my signature.  My prognosis is good.

							They said it was an eggsized tumor.  How big is that as far as centimeters.  I've found information about 2cm and 5 cm.  If it's less than 2, more than 2, less than 5, more than 5.  A lot of information to decipher.  I don't know if they are going to remove lymph nodes or what.  I haven't spoken with the dr.  myself so am just going by what i have been told by mom.  Does a bigger tumor mean the cancer is worse?  It's overwhelming!  I guess wednesday will tell us a lot more.  Thank you!

							There are about 2.54 centimeters in an inch.  So you can kind of figure it out from there.  I had a 4 cm lymph node and I figured it was about the size of a plum.  One thing the doctor told me was not to look as stats on the internet because they are not accurate because if they are 5 year stats, they start 5 years ago...not now going forward.  And there are new advances everyday so chances are better now.  Don't panic but if you can go to the doctor with your mom...someone should go with her because it's a lot of info to take in on your own...the more sets of ears there, the better.
						

"

							Your mother's treatment sounds pretty standard. Like Shelly said, a lot will depend on what they find in the lymph nodes. Also, the hormone receptivity of her tumor will dictate additional medication she may be urged to take. I know that you must feel frightened and nervous about all of this, but it is doable. Women survive breast cancer every day, and more every year. If you can, like Shelly suggested, go to the doctor's appointments with your mom. It will help you understand what she is going to go through and a second set of ears is always helpful for the patient. There is a lot of good information at the Imaginis.com web site. I suggest you check it out. Don't hesitate to come here with questions and concerns, too. We will do what we can to help both of you. Hugs, Lauri

							Hi,
I found an ""egg size"" mass in my breast 3 years ago Monday.   My tumor ended up being 5.5 cm.  That included any tissue around the actual tumor that had cancer cells in it as well.  The didn't do SNB 3 years ago when I was dx, so when they did the mastectomy, they removed all my lymph nodes as well.  As you can see at the bottom of this page, I had 9 positive lymph nodes out of 16.  It's always better not to have lymph nodes involved BUT, IF she does have positive nodes, that doesn't mean that she can't live to be a ripe old age.  Having positive nodes doesn't mean the end of the road.  I know quite a few ladies, like me were dx with Stage III and had as many nodes positive as me and some more and they are doing great 5, 6 and 9 years out.  Treatment is even better today then it was 3 years ago when I was dx.  I was also considered ""high risk"" because I was ""young"".  They will check and see if she is hormone receptive, which means that her cancer feeds off of hormones (estrogen and progesterine).  That is a good thing because there are meds out there that, like me, I'm taking for 5 years.  The one I'm taking is Arimidex.  If she's estrogen/progesterine negative, again that does NOT mean that she won't live to be a ripe old age.  They can tell alot by testing the tissue they remove.  I'd definately have someone be with your mom at every visit.  It is very overwhelming to hear that you have BC and I know I didn't hear 1/2 of what my oncologist said.  Not that I wasn't listening, but our brains shut down when it can't absorb anymore and every visit, whoever went with me heard things I didn't and that was good.  Have her write a list of questions that she has so she doesn't forget them.  Another term you'll hear is HER2.  You'd rather have that negative.  Someone with a tiny tumor and no nodes can have a reoccurence as well as someone with a large tumor and positive nodes can go and not have a reoccuence.  There is no sense to this disease, it has a mind of it's own.
I personally, plan on being around for a long time 

Keep us posted and if you have any more questions, ask away.  All of us have been there and done that or going through it now.

							Hi, Shawn.  So sorry that your mom has been diagnosed but as everyone has said, treatment today is so much better than it used to be.  You didn't give your age but I can tell you my daughter (Soph in college) had the same questions you did when I told her.  She was looking for any answers she could get.  She went to the doctor with me and it was not only a great help to me but a huge help to her.  Go with your mom if you can.  I was diagnosed 10/14/04, had surgery, one node positive, 4 chemo treatments and now in 4th week of radiation.  I'll have 4 more chemo treatments when radiation is through and hopefully by June will be finished and then on medication for 5 years and I can tell you I'm looking toward a ripe old age.  My daughter was a great inspiration to me and told me ""we're going to get through this together"".  I couldn't do this without her.  She gives me strength to keep a positive attitude, and a positive attitude will go along way with your mom to make her feel as normal as possible.  The treatments are excellent today and the prognosis is so much better for us than it used to be.  You stay positive so that your mom will stay positive.  Let us know her diagnosis and come back to us when you have more questions or need positive thoughts.  We're here for you.

							I'm sorry to hear about your mom.  Couple of things I want to say about breast cancer.  It is not an automatic death sentence.  We are all individuals.  Your mom is her OWN person... not a stat...not a number.  Just because she reads or hears of something happening bad to anyone else doesn't mean it will be that way for her.  War stories abound.  That's unfortunate because there's a lot of us survivors out here!

I was dx'd 6 years ago, at age 56...my whole breast was riddled with cancer right to the nipple.  I had an MRM, my nodes removed (7 were positive) and an expander put in for an implant all at once.  I went through treatment.  Didn't throw up from chemo.  Didn't burn horribly from radiation.  I am a 6 year survivor now, Stage IIB.

My mom was dx'd 4 years ago at age 85 with a HUGE lump.  HUGE.  She was too frail for chemo and she is a bleeder.  So they did only a lumpectomy, no nodes out, and radiation.  She did fine with the treatment.  No tamoxifen, or anything else because of her frailty.  4 years later, she got another big lump in the same breast.  So she had a mastectomy at age 89 because they were concerned that it might ulcerate inside and for her, the bleeding is dangerous.  She healed well.  Her scans are clear again.

I have tips and hints on chemo...I had A/C and taxol.  I share them.  You tell your mom that you will both get her through this and we will help!

							Hey, just wanted to update all of you on my mom.  They went in and took the lining of her breast out and removed lymph nodes.  My dad went and talked to the dr. yesterday.  Dad said the dr. told him they removed 40 lymph nodes from under her right arm and 8 or 9 of them were positive i guess.  40 lymph nodes?  Doesn't sound right to me.  She has an appt. with the dr. on the 23 of Feb.  I am going with her to get it straight from the dr. myself.  I was with her the day of her surgery and couldn't hardly get him to talk to us.  I have been trying to get her to go the Lexington, Ky to someone who specializes in this and oncologist.  The dr. that is treating her now is just a general surgeon.  Mom says she is comfortable with him.  I'm trying my best to talk her into this.  The plan now is radiation and chemo.  Give me some input on this folks.  Thanks.

I thought it would be good that all we would write all the risks starting from the very important and ending with something that is not prooved yet but is considered as a risk too.


So to start:

GENDER  (being a woman is almost the bigger risk factor because women get BC 100 times more often than men)

AGE (the chances to get BC become bigger with the age)

EARLY FIRST MENSTRUATION, LATE MENOPACE 

if I say something wrong please correct me

							When I asked my surgeon what I had done to cause me to have BC because there was no family history, he told me that only accounts for about 10-15% of BC.  I'm sure there are things that they think could play a factor in, like never having kids, but there are a whole lot of ladies out there with BC that had kids.  He said the reason I have BC is because I'm a woman and have estrogen and progestine.  Of coure I'm er/pr+ which says that my cancer was feeding off hormones, that why I'm now on Arimidex.  I don't think they know why women are dx with BC who are er/pr-.  I ""think"" the younger you are, the more likely you'll be er/pr-, but if I recall, 80% of a BC are er/pr+.

							what does er/pr+ and er/pr- mean?   And how would I know which is mine?

							You wouldn't know unless you had breast cancer.  They would find out all of that when they send the breast tissue/tumor to pathology and that's when you find out everything.  er/pr is the abbreviation of what I wrote about it.....estrogen receptor and progesterine receptor, 2 kinds of hormones we have.

							I totally agree that we should all be aware of risk factors of breast cancer. One more thing that I have to emphasize is annual mammogram and breast examination are too important to ignore. Early diagnosis is the key to cure and have good prognosis.

							Hi everyone,
  If anyone recalls my tumor markers have been steadily rising.  Since last year. From 28 to now 120. They were 78 back in November.  I had PETS, MRI CT and Bone scan, which showed nothing back in October.  Now my onc is ordering the tests all over again.  She sees no other reason for the rise other than disease coming back.  I do have benign lesions in my liver that have grown, but are benign. She said that could possibly be the cause, she is unsure as she has never had any patients with benign liver growths and markers rising. She rarely does markers, only a handful of patients so she has nothing to go on there.  I am scheduling the tests as soon as possible, but wonder if I should be seeing someone else, a major cancer center - just for an opinion.  
  I know I must have asked before, but does anyone have rising markers as high as mine with no evidence of disease?
Thanks so much, I am grasping at straws and pulling out my hair.

							Hi Jayne,
I'm not a doctor, but I'd be shocked if those same tests you just had 2 months ago showed anything.  Had it been a year or even 6 months, if yours was aggressive, then maybe but..........  PET Scans are so sensitive and natorious for false positives and yours coming out clean 2 months ago.  I just don't see it.  I have heard of many who have had markers go up and it not be a reoccurence.  Which ones does she do?  Mine did CA27-29 for about a year to see what was ""normal"" for me.  He didn't even do the 1st one until Oct. 03 and I was dx 2/02.  I do know that the, I think it's the CA125 or the CEA can change for the strangest reasons.  A friend of mine has which ever one of those I'm thinking about and hers went up and up and they did every test and she was fine.  Ended up that she quit smoking and it started coming down and was normal again in about 6 months.  
Don't get me wrong, YOU are more important then anything, but I'd check with your insurance.  Most will not pay for a PET unless there is a specific reason for it.  With you having one just 2 months ago and it being normal, they may not pay and those things are expensive.  
Did they biopsy the liver growths to know they were benign?  My guess that's what it is.  One of the ladies from another board I use to go on had her markers go up and up and, matter of fact 2 of them and it had to do with the liver, but NOT cancer.
I wish I could be of more help.  I know you're scared.  My check up is Monday and I'm scared.  This disease seems to keep us scared to some point and other times more so.
Please keep us posted.
Hugs and prayers

							Hi Jayne.  I can't help you as as to the tumor markers but you might try going to this website at the American Cancer Society.  They explain in detail the different kinds of tumor markers and levels that are normal and not, HOWEVER, they do indicate that even high markers are not always a sign of cancer.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you.

							There are many types of tumor markers and many other causes may elevate the TM value. Breat cancer has its specific TM but none of them are specific enough to offer diagnosis or confirm a recurrence.  Evidence from physical examination or imaging studies are required to call a recurrence. An elevated TM, if the TM is associated to the diagnosis, may offer a warning sign only. Physicians need to do more tests to find the lesion(s). 
Please discuss with your oncologists to see if further investigations are needed.

							Hi and sorry you had to come to a breast cancer forum, but you couldn't have found a better one.  We're so lucky to have a med. oncologist who started this and a rads oncologist who's also a huge part of the forum.

You'll notice that quite a few of us have our dx, treatments, stages etc. at the bottom of each of our posts.  That way we don't have to ask the same questions and you can see when we were dx and how we're doing.  It's always nice to see ladies that are doing well years after dx. 

You can go to your profile and type in your info.

Everyone have a great weekend.  At least there is a race on Sat. night and NASCAR season is getting underway, so hopefully that will take my mind off of Monday's check up, if even for a couple of hours.........CALGON take me away..... lol

							I didn't have any significant eyesight problems during chemo, but have read several posts on different boards from those who have and it seems most think it's a good idea to wait until a few months after chemo to see where your vision will stablilize before spending big bucks on new glasses.  I'm sure others with more reliable input will reply also!!

							Hi,
A friend of mine and I were talking today about the same thing.  Both of us have noticed a different in our vision.  I've always had 20/20 vision and I've notice that things seem blurry at times, especially up close.  I know the print has gotten smaller in things like the t.v. guide etc., but I really have to get some things in just the right light to be able to read it.  It will be 3 years in June since I've had chemo and it's not gotten any better.  I'm going to get my eyes checked as soon as I can have a few months of a break for docs.....ugh  My onco is Monday and my general surgeon is May 1 and dentist inbetween.  I think my rads onco is in April.  Right now I'm going to get through Monday, go to Talladega and escape reality and then back to the doctors...... The one thing I can say about this disease, is once we have it, we don't get blown off and everything chalked up to be stress.  Some of course is, but it's nice to know that someone takes you seriously now.

							Hi, Shelley:  I have had blurry eyesight as well since chemo.  I thought it was just my eyesight getting worse but during my weekly visits with the radiologist to do bloodwork, etc the radiologist asked if I had noticed any difference in my eyesight.  I told her I had but just figured I was due for another exam and my eyes were getting worse.  She told me that often chemo has an effect on eyesight and can make them blurry.  She advised me not to do anything now but to wait until my radiation was completed and my next round of chem which is to begin in March and end beginning of June.  She said it would then take several months for it to improve after that.  She said she has known of women who get their prescription changed soon after chemo only to have the prescription changed again several months later when eyesight improved.  I  had never seen that as a side effect of chemo but evidently it can be a common problem.  Hope that helps.

							Oh my gosh! I've been telling my Husband for over a year now that my eyesight wasn't as good as it used to be.Jan. of 04 was my last treatment,it had gotten to the point that I couldn't read the menu screen on the TV much less read what anything was about.My daughter or husband would have to read it for me -it was soooo blurry,I would get so aggravated that I would get up and stand in front of the TV so I wouldn't bother everybody else ,like they could see through me-ha ha!
I finally two weeks ago while my daughter was getting her annual exam I ask if he could see me too.Results - near sighted.Man I feel so dumb I have this antique mirror ,it has this hazy hue to it ,right ,well it's not quite as bad as I thought now that I have my new glasses-  Wow I 'm still amazed with these new things,I'll look at something then pull the glasses down and put 'em back everything is so much clearer,I can even see where I need to dust  Guess there's no more excuses huh.
I still think it was the chemo ,I had 20/20 before it.This is the first time I've seen anyone post on the subject.Everyone kept telling me aw your just getting older-ah ha! Maybe --maybe not.
Glad I'm not the only one----Thanks You Guys.Keep 'em posting!

							HI Sue,
We aren't getting older and we're just about the same age.  Print is getting smaller...... LOL
I'm calling to make an appt. with my eye doctor.  I can't believe that chemo doesn't or can't affect your eye sight since I didn't start having problems until then.  Some print, like the t.v. has gotten smaller.  Maybe the eye docs and the publishers are into together on a conspiracy.........LOLOL
						

"

							Book publishers and computer manufacturers are also in  on the conspiracy.   

Truthfully though, I called my opthamologist...my eyes were bad to begin with but have gotten so much worse, it's hard to read.  And I love to read!!  Anyway, my eye doc said that chemo could definately affect eyesight.  He told me not to get new glasses during my treatment but to wait about 3-4 months after I finish because it's likely my eyesight will change after I'm done...probably back to like it was before I started or close to it.  So anyway, I spend many nights trying to decipher the blurry words in my book...Oh well...

							Hi - 

My mom developed a pleural effusion late last year, and surgery revealed a tumor on her right lung. She is on the West Coast of the U.S., and I live in Germany, so I haven't been able to talk to her doctors or anything, but the information I get from her is a little confusing. Here's what I've been able to gather over a few months of weekly phone calls.
-a biopsy turned up no malignant cells, but the tumor spreads

-the doctor said she has cancer; my understanding was that malignant tumors are cancer, but benign ones are not. is that wrong?

-they're calling it a ""pseudo-mesothelioma"" and saying it has never been treated - that is, they have found it in autopsies of already-dead people, but not in live ones, as I understand it. I have found a few accounts of mesothelioma victims online, but nothing at all about this pseudo- business.
So I'm a bit baffled. Is this cancer? Is this ""pseudo-mesothelioma"" a known term, or did her doctors just make it up to refer to her particular case? Years ago she had a brain tumor the docs didn't quite understand, and they labeled it an ""atypical meningioma"". She had some radiation therapy and she never had any problems with it after that, unless this is related to it. 

I've never been close to anyone who's had cancer before, so I am woefully ignorant of even the most basic facts. Now that I am faced with it in my mother, I'm not sure where to go for more information. There's so much on the internet, I don't know how to filter it all. The mesothelioma sites I checked didn't quite fit with the information I have about her. I'm thinking it's the ""pseudo"" that's causing the confusion.

Has anybody here ever heard of this? I'd appreciate any information or clarification.

Many thanks,

							I would like to know if anyone has any advice on alcoholism among cancer survivors.  Are there any support groups? Is there anyone who deals with survival this way?  I was diagnosed with stage 3b lymphoma at the age of 22.  I am now 26 years old and although I have stepped back into ""normal"" life, I now have a serious alcohol problem.  I have not dealt with the fact that before surgury I had less than 12 hours to live, I have not dealt with the fact that 2 years of my life were eaten by this disease.  I think that I have survivors guilt.  At times I wonder why God spared my life.  At times I have been so depressed over such a traumatic experience I wish I had not survived.  will someone please give me some advise?  I need a support group of people who have been through similar experiences.  I have a wonderful family and beautiful girlfriend who are willing to help with whatever i may need, but i dont know exactly what it is that i need.

							A friend of mine recently died from cirrhosis and it is not a pleasant way to die - you bleed from all orifices. He lost his job, wife, 5 children and all of his friends except his dear sister who is my best friend.  Although you have a supportive family and girfriend perhaps now you need the support of others who have gone through alcoholism. Try Alcoholics Anonymous - I'm sure their phone number is in your local directory. You have made the first very important step in acknowledging you have an alcohol problem - you just need help in overcoming the addiction. Most of us on this forum have had to deal with our own mortality in facing imminent death from cancer, myself included. It is tough....the treatment and the emotional treadmill, but alcohol is not the answer. Does the hospital that treated you have some kind of counselling service? They may be able to help you.  I wish you well in turning your life around.

							Hello daniel,

You know what? Cancer does not only happen to people without other problems in their lives.  Dizzy gave you sage advice, just one more thing. You are worried about whether you have some type of guilt over ""making it through"".  Talk to some doctor that you trust to steer you in the direction of a licensed therapist that makes that one of their specialties. 

Your problem would be viewed as ""dual"", the alcohol what ever the therapist and you  come up with.  Regardless, sober is better and AA can help you if you let yourself  be open to the help.

Very Best of Luck & Support,

							My new Dear Friend,

You are already on your way to recovery.  Just admitting and acknowledging the fact that you are drinking too much is much more than many alcoholics can do.  My father was recently diagnosed with lung cancer,thats what got me here, he has been sober for 20 yrs , and I myself have been sober for 5 years, after a nasty 25yr bout with alcoholism.  Recovery is absolutley doable in any situation, there are two significant things that changed my life...And this is my story only I'm just going to tell you what worked for me.  Prayer Prayer Prayer, I gave my life to Jesus, and the other no less important was that I stopped acting and treating myself like a victim.  When we victimize ourselves we become less willing to take responsibility for our situations.  God Bless you friend.  I'm praying for you right now.  I have much more story to tell if you want to chat.  Good Luck.

							Hi Daniel,

I noticed that Your last post was in February-it is now July--How are You doing?It sounds to me like You are depressed-I could be wrong-using the alcohol to cover up how You really feel. I'm far from being an expert,I myself used to drink,now I have no desire for it -my Doctor put me on an antidepressant and all of my desire to drink are gone.That wasn't the reason that I was given the anti depressant but a side effect I can live with.This is a good thing for the fact that my cholesterol and triglycerides were so high for so long caused me to end up with a fatty liver which if not controlled and taken care of could possibly turn into cirrhosis.My Sister is in the latter stages of this disease-no one in the family realized she had drank so much everyday-it was mind boggling to find out.She's on a liver transplant list.We almost lost her 2 months ago-she doesn't realize that I (or the family) know that the last time she was hospitalized it was obvious she had been drinking again,She started throwing up at work(blood),her husband picked her up took her home as she continued to throw up blood ---finally her son thought she was going to die and made her go to the hospital-she had three tares in her esophagus(sp)they managed to get two of the tares stitched the last one after two days finally clotted.They kept her knocked out for four days to keep her from going into DT's which would have killed her-more blood vessels would have ruptured.I'm hoping and praying that she doesn't get kicked off of the transplant list -that is really her last hope-I live about 900 miles from her,it sure is difficult being this far away when she's going through all of this.I assume alcohol is just as addictive as cigarettes or anything else-making it hard to walk away from.Some people(like my Sister)really don't have a choice-well I guess she has 1 to live or to die.I hope it's the first one.I know that You can't help anyone that is not willing to help themselves.I sure hope You get everything straightened out,You're pretty young,ny sister will be 50 this year -if she makes it to her birthday in December. 
Please do what You have to to take care of yourself.We may not understand what our purpose for being here is ,but the fact is You are still here,so make the most of everyday and do what You beleive to be true and good.You'll be in my prayers!

							I was diagnosed in Sept 04 with advanced stage Invasive Lobular Carcinoma. I had yearly mamo's and now know that mamo's are great at detecting ductile carcinoma due to the calcification but mamo's are poor at picking up lobular carcinoma. I have two sisters who are getting ready for their yearly mamo's. I have suggested to each of them that they also get an ultrasound, which is good at detecting lobular carcinoma but not good at detecting ductile carcinoma. One of my sister's doctors agrees with that course of action. The other doctor, in another state, has prescribed an MRI instead. Long story short, will an MRI pick up both types of breast cancer?

First, congrats on almost being done with chemo.  You are just about done with everything my friend.  I had radiation burns, but radiation should be a breeze compared to chemo.  You'll be hit by 3 angles like I was with all the node involvement you have, as I did.  Use aloe vera after each treatment (not before) and if you start itching, I was given a RX for ""Zone A"" cream that really helped.  The only thing bad about radiation is you go everyday.  I had a hour each way so that made it tougher.  You'll see the same people everyday and before long, everyone in the room feels like they know each other.  I actually miss seeing some of the people that were taking radiation the same time I was.  Not bad enough to go through it again...... lol

I like you had ILC.  No one tells us that mammograms miss 45% of all BC in women under 50 and doesn't pick up Lobular until we are dx.  You gave your sisters good advice.

Let us know when all treatment is over and we'll all do the NED dance with you.  Most onco consider you NED either on the day you were dx or the day you had the obvious cancer removed, so you're already there

							Hi,
As most of you know, because I run my mouth all the time   I was dx Stage III on Valentine's Day, 2002.  Well, Valentine's Day, 2005, I am still riding on that wonderful NEDtrain.................wooohooooo.  I think NED and I will sit back and enjoy the news.  I'll still freak out before every check up, but that's what I do best...... lol

For anyone taking Arimidex.  I talked to the onco. today to find out if my lipids being 650 is a false positive from the Arimidex or if Arimidex actually causes cholesterol, especially lipids to go up.  Be sure and get your cholesterol checked.  Arimidex DOES cause them to go up and it's not a false positive.  They are trying me on Lipitor since Zocor was giving me a fit.

I think I'll get the ""kids"" together and have them do the NED dance with me.  Hey, my animals know I'm nuts, but they humor me.......LOL

Thanks for all your prayers, good thoughts and support!!!!!!!!!!!

Question for the docs............ Is it more encouraging to see a Stage III NED for 3 years, starting the 4th since I was high risk to start with, then if I was a Stage I or no nodes, or not much difference.  I know you can't tell me it won't ever come back, but would like your imput.  I forgot to ask my onco.........he's use to me being DUH.... lol

							Hey Nancy and all,
Nancy, so glad to hear your appointment went well.  Time to breath a little until the next time around.  You are going on 4 years, that is wonderful!    I am going on 2 years since my dx on Good Friday (April 2003)

Like Nancy said most of you know we both had appointments today.  Like Nancy, I am lucky enough to say that I also had a good appointment. Although my med oncol does not really do much other than a really good breast exam...no blood, no scans...nothing...But she does ask a lot of questions and takes her time with me.  We discussed staying on the tamox for the full five years but we will see what happens.   I also had my 6 month GYN last week and still waiting for those results but today went well.  Right now I need to stay focused on the good news and not think about my May appointments!
Take care all

Hello, 

I was in the process of searching information about tissue expanders and came across your site. I have read the postings with interest and would like to be on board also. 

I had a lumpectomy in 91 with radiation and here I am 13 years later with re-curring breast ca. I elected to have a bi-lateral mastectomy because I don' t want to do this any more. I had the sentinel node dissection done and there was no sentinel node found so they removed a few nodes to be safe. I have tissue expanders in and will start expansion next week. I have found this whole thing quite uncomfortable expecially the side that was previously radiated. I am now on anti-biotics for infection. 

When I saw the plastic surgeon she said I cannot use antiperspirants. Have any of you been told that? When researching I also found that parabens are thought to be a bad thing with breast ca. Do you know anything about that? 

I have to say only prayer has brought me through this. I am so looking forward to getting the next surgery over.

							Hi, Betty.  I have read this before so I looked it up some time ago on the American Cancer website.  The link below may be what you are talking about as it discusses antiperspirants and parabens.  Dr. Leo probably has more information he can provide as to whether it is true or not but you may want to print this out and ask your doctor if this is related to their concern.

							Hi Betty,
I tried to have expanders and then implants done for reconstruction when I decided to have the other breast removed since I was ""young"" and had ILC which is prone to spread to the other breast.

I've heard good stories about tissue expanders when radiation has been used, but my PS will no longer do it.  I tried and my expander on the radiated side was extremely painful and when the PS went in to get rid of some of the scar tissue from rads, the tissue expander was literally trying to push back out of my chest near the sternum.   Needless to say, I woke up with no expanders.

I wish now I had opted for the LD Flap, but I'm content being boobless and NED.  One day, maybe I will try again, but no time soon.

Hopefully it being so long since you had radiation will make a difference and your reconstruction much easier.

							Hello,
I am still a newbie but thanks to the list manager for getting me up and running. I had Stage one-less than 5cm but have Grade 3-most agressive type of ca. No nodes were involved thank God but am starting chemo tomorrow. I am terrified. Is this normal? Is it horrible? Are there really good day? Any thoughts will be so appreciated.
Prayers even more so.

							Dear British,
Sorry to hear about your diagnosis. Well, this is certainly not normal. Breast cancer, no matter at which stage or grade, is always a serious disease.
Stage I breast cancer is usually smaller than 2 cm, and any tumor <=5cm can be either stage I or II. Breast cancer has 3 grades and grade III is the highest grade (poor differentiation). Poorly differentiated breast cancer has higher chance of distant spread and that is why many medical oncologists will recommend chemotherapy for that group of patients, although the T stage (of TNM system) could be relatively early.
Although breast cancer is a tough disease, it is treatable with surgery, chemotherapy and/or radiation. I think all patients has to face it and fight, together with their physicians. The prognosis for most stage I breast cancer is not bad after approp. therapy. You should discuss with your oncologist to confirm your stage and prognosis. Thay may let you feel much better. 
Good Luck,

							Glad to see that you are up and running, Betty. I FINALLY saw your message. Shame on me for not seeing it sooner.   Is fear normal? I would have to say yes. This is serious stuff and it is what we do not know that frightens us in situations like this. I did not have chemo, but many of my breast friends did. And, they all say it is doable. I am sure some of the gals here will post about their experiences with chemo. A couple of things that I hear repeatedly are to drink lots and lots of water to flush the drugs through your system. The other is to take the anti-naseua meds whether you think you are going to need them or not. Finally, most say that losing their hair was the most traumatic part of the treatment. But, it does grow back. What I am sharing is hearsay, so I hope some experienced hands share their knowledge with you. Glad to see you back on the board. Hugs, Lauri

							Hi Betty,
Sorry you had to join the ""club"" of breast cancer ladies.  Being scared is very normal.  The word ""cancer' itself scared me long before I was dx.  I don't know what kind of chemo you are taking, but because I was Stage III w/9+ nodes, I was on a very aggressive chemo combo.  I took 3 chemos each treatment.  It wasn't fun, but it's doable.  Everyone responds to chemo different.  I never got sick, but had nausea.  They have come out with new meds for that since I was dx 3 years ago today.  They are always making progress with treatment and side affects.
You will go through an emotional roller coaster from hell in the beginning.  I'm not saying that to scare you, but for you to know when you think you are feeling something that you've never felt before (emotionally) or if you ever think what you are feeling isn't normal......... it is.  Once you start treatment, believe it or not, you'll find humor in some of the things people say or things you do.  We have to find humor in this mess to save our sanity.  Anytime you need to ask a question or feel something out of the ordinary for you, write us and there's nothing you will tell us that we haven't all felt and hopefully that will help you, to know you aren't alone.
I had no problem or regrets having both breasts removed at 43.  Losing my hair was the hardest part, but even then, after you have accepted it's coming out or gone, you'll be o.k.  My hair is half way down my back and I never thought that would happen.
We're hear for you anytime.

							I was horrified when I met with the surgeon after my bilateral modified mastectomies and learned how extensive my breast cancer was. I was in a fog for a few days and then moved on. I just had my 7th round of chemo yesterday. I am on an dose dense regimen, every other monday for 8 treatments. I had four rounds of Adriamycin/Cytoxin and have had 3 of 4 rounds of taxol.  I drank too much water the day before, the day of and the day after my first chemo and had horrible side effects from that. For the next 3 rounds with A/C I was very sick for the first week, I couldn't get any anti-nausea medicines to work. I was tired and my eyesight was blurry. I had headaches from the steroid that is also given. It was cruddy but not impossible. I still have my hair though. Sometime between my 2nd and 3rd chemo it started to break off about 1 inch from my scalp and was making a mess around the house. I had my husband buzz cut me, like GI Jane, and that's the way it has stayed. If I had known it wasn't going to all fall out I wouldn't have done the buzz cut. Live and Learn. The taxol is much easier than the A/C. My main side effects are upset stomach and bone pain, which has gotten worse with the Nuelasta shot and Taxol together. I have pain meds for it and so I never thought to discontinue treatment. I'm tired a bit, but that is managable too. I also went into a chemically induced menopause and I am hot and cold all night long. I don't get a solid nights sleep mostly due to the hot and cold, but also because I have a port on my right side of my chest that is uncomfortable to sleep on and I have severe bone pain in my left hip if I lay on it for more than about 30 minutes.  I hope this doesn't sound too horrible. It isn't good but it is do-able. The fears subside as you move along the different steps in the process. I hope this is helpful for you and good luck with your chemo,

							Hi Betty,
Jan is right.  You should drink plenty of water the day of and for the next couple of days after chemo to flush it out.  The onco should give you a list of things to do and what side affects are very common and if you have a problem, when you should call them.  Most tolerate chemo without much more then nausea and fatigue.  I've seen women who went to work everyday during it.  I think fatigue is a given, but some don't even have nausea.  I never had to take the Nuelasta shot which will cause bone pain because my white counts rebounded on their own after they bottomed out.  
Your onco will probably tell you to stay away from strawberries and salads because where normally it wouldn't phase us, strawberries are impossible to get completely clean.  Mine told me with a few exceptions, to eat what I felt like.  I actually found that when I had nausea, when I ate something like baked chicken, it calmed my stomach.  More then likely you'll gain weight from the steroids (Decadron) but you can lose that when treatment is done.  I had no problems from the steroids.  They will give you nausea meds along with the chemo.
Again, most tolerate it well and just take it one day at a time.  You'll get through this and we'll be here to help in anyway we can.  Before you know it, treatment will be over, your hair will start growing back and you'll start to get more energy back.  It was 3 years ago yesterday I was dx and it's seems so hard to believe that much time has passed.
Hugs and prayers and know you aren't alone.  We're with you each step of the way.

							My cancer was diagnosed as Her+++ and ER-/PR-. My threatment following mastectomy & node disection (8/11+) consisted of 4 rounds of AC (Adriamycin & Cytoxin) 3 weeks apart. When that was done I received 4 rounds of Taxotere 3 weeks apart. When all of that was finished I had weekly Herceptin infusions for a year. I tolerated it all very well. I did not have any nausea since they gave me drugs (can't remember the name rght now). I did loose my hair but it returned when I began the taxotere. The nurse said that this was very unusual (leave it to me!). The taxotere also caused a numbness in my fingers and toes that has since disappeared. I also would feel exhauseted the third day after the treatments. My blood counts did not drop dangerously low since they gave me Neulasta or Procrit the day after the chemo. The Herceptin did not cause any side effects that I noticed. I should mention that I was only 32 when diagnosed so the nurses think my age may have helped me tolerate the harsh regiment. I am now 35 and have been NED for almost a year since completing all of the above. If you would like to contact me please feel free to email me at Bbeth69@aol.com. Good Luck!

Hi Anne, I'm Nancy's friend Christa---I was diagnosed with HerNeu++ and I'm taking taxotere and Xeloda---my understanding is that taxotere is pretty standard when you have the HerNeu++.  I think your oncologist or chemotherapist is definitely on the right track.....

							Dear Annie,
I don't think the medical oncologists will give chemotherapy only because the Her2 was positive.  Usually it depends on the TNM stage, differentiation (grade of the cancer), and ER/PR status.
Usually premenopausal females with negative ER/PR are not treated with hormonal therapy, and depends on the stage and differentiation, chemotehrapy may be indicated. 
As far as I know, Herceptin is not indicated for early stage breast cancer even if the Her2 was positive. Since I am not a medical oncologists, you should talk to your treating oncologist to ask why chemotherapy is indicated in your case, and I am sure you will find a lot more informatin from him regarding your pathology and diagnosis.

							First thank you all for your responses to my questions of HER2NEU.
Second I must let you all know that I had called my Radiation Oncologist to let him know that my onco. wanted me to take Taxol (Taxenes) because as he had told me I was NER2NEU Post., well my Rad. Oncol. said he was looking at my reports and I am NOT POSTITVE but I am Negative.  SHOCK.  He was to call my oncol. to make sure he had the same paperwork and to ask what he had stating that I was Postitive.  So now here is the next line of questions since I am so totally confused!!

My stats are as follows: Infiltrated Ductual Carsinoma

ER-, PR-, Her2-, Ki-67 60% (? I have no clue as to what that is) No Nodes were involved, margins clean, lumpectomy 3cm with 3 cm of clean tissue.  I am 50 yrs. old Sentinal Node Biop. (3 nodes all clean), Premenapausal.  I have three sessions of Adromyicin & Cytoxin w/Krtril (Alozi), Decadron, Ativan & Emend.  I continue with Emend days 2 3 & 4 2 x's daily. Warafin (Blood thinner) daily. I am on Dose Dense of every 14 days.  So now the burning question of ISN'T this ENOUGH treatment yet?  Or is Taxol still necessary?  
Thank you all again - Many Many HUGS :))

							I often wonder if waiting to start an AI would be more beneficial for any particular group of women, say starting it at 5 years after finishing treatment rather than immediately after finishing treatment (assuming of course that one makes it to 5 years). The reason I wonder is because when I look at predictors, the percentages of survival and of recurrence drop so much at around 4 or 5 years for those who aren't on hormonal therapy, but are fairly high for the first couple of years after treatment -- and that trend continues to get worse. In other words, does the protective effect of hormonal therapy diminish over time, so it would be better to start later if one has fairly good odds to begin with?
						

"
"


							What I don't understand is my oncologist and friend's I've talked to about it, their oncologists say the same thing as mine.  The longer you go without a reoccurence, the better the chances are you won't.  But, if you read some of these sites, they say that our chances of having a reoccurence increase after 5 years.  I have faith in my onco and it makes sense that the longer you go without one, the less likely you are to have one because it shows you weren't chemo resistant.
Just one more thing that is there to confuse us and make us go more nuts...... I'm already nuts, so I don't have much farther to go... lol
I know with Tamoxefin, studies showed no benefit to taking it 10 years vs 5 and if I read it right, it was basically saying that after 5 years it's tought, for lack of a better word, your body to do on it's own what it does for you.  I could have totally misunderstood that though.
After 6 months of Tamoxefin and more info out on Arimidex, I opted with my onco's blessings to change to Arimidex because it was showing to be superior to Arimidex and since the 5 year study has come out just recently, it's showing that it IS superior in preventing reoccurences.
And they wonder why we are confused........geesh

							Hi all,
I just had my oncol visit and asked her the very same thing.  I cannot switch to the Arimidex yet because I am pre-menopausal.  She feels I am tolerating the tamox just fine so the plan is to remain on it for the full 5 years, at which point then switching to the Arimidex.  She also said that this gives me 10 years (crossing fingers) to take advantage of the hormonal therapy.  So, unless something changes in the next few years I will take her advice.  If I am still pre-menopausal when I complete the tamox (been on it for 16 months) then we will discuss taking the ovaries out and forcing myself into full menopause so I can go on the Arimidex.
I am not sure I am making much sense here...LOL

							Girls,

There is a lot we do not know about this. The reason you use it for 5 years is that this is the length that has been used in clinical trials. It has been shown that there is not benefit beyond 5 years of tamoxifen.

Also, since all the trials are done starting tamoxifen immediatelly, there is no way to know what would happen if someone starts taking it after 5 years.

All I know is that a tumor ""burned itsself out"" on his kidney.  They are also confused as they say they are looking for the ""mother"" cancer and cannot find.  Still, 10 weeks after diagnosis and constant re prescribing pain medication, they now say chemo is not an option as he is now diagnosed with Hep C so they will do 20 or so radiation treatments.  Three ""specialists"" cannot come up with the same diagnosis yet all are saying ""don't worry, it can be cured.  Why can't they agree on the type and treat it accordingly?  Very confused sister.

							Thank you for your response, Leo...I see you keep up with many forums.  One Dr. has stated lymphoma but will not state the type, he is only guessing.  Another said Germ Cancer...looks like I have a lot of research to do.  BTW-I live 4 hours from my brother and am getting bits and pieces but no one has been told a type yet.  I made them promise to write it down so I can research if the Doctors ever find what they are treating.  I am just trying to figure out why they cannot come up with a name even after at least 6 biopsies, several CT's, Pets and other tests.  I mean, how do they know it is cancer if they cannot determine the type?  Thank you again, SinThea

I agree with you. Sometimes the biopsy results are ""inconclusive"", and often they have to do more tests and stains on the biopsy specimen. It may be difficult to determine what type of cancer it is.

							Well, I have found they are ""putting their heads together"" at Johns Hopkins, all results sent there.  A Team is trying to decipher typing, stage; although they will start radiation next week, I think.  Maybe they can determine the type, cause or ideology.  I just lost my other brother one year ago with another disease so I guess I am a little protective of this one.  Funny, I'm in perfect health. Anyway, enough sentiments...thank you Leo and if I find a type or anything and have a question, I hope you will be available to answer..SinThea

 be happy someone is doing something, i have had strep staph and yeast in my feet in August of 2004, i had some spots on my hands prior to this but were overlooked when  i went to have something cut off of my shoulder, now they are gone. The staph and stuff in my feet were diagnosed by a dermatologist after a culture was done. Well she put me on antibiotic after antibiotic, i went to another doctor who put me on yet, another antibiotic and a antidepressant, made me worse, feet cleared up on levequin but now my skin has changed all over my body, went to another doctor after i told this one i had concerns for cancer, he told me i am a hypochindriac, needless to say went to another doctor who blew off the spot in the back of my throat then showed up, he put me on yet another antidepressant rather then checking into the situation after countless requests to be screened for cancer due to mother and father both dying of cancer. quit going to him , went to a cancer center they told me my feet were just scaly, never have been just scaly in my life, i dont think they have heard of foot cancer, but hey this is spreading now, now my gums are receeding, and yet no one has done any blood work anywhere or even checked for cancer, they are writing me off it seems. this is a shame i am a public servant and 33 yrs old. thi sis ridiculous, so at least be thankful that someone found this and it has been diagnosed, could be in my boat and be setting here slowly dying and no one caring. i am sure someone on here will say boy sounds like you have anxiety or depression, nah im just chapped getting done this way, suppossed to go to the doctor tomorrow morning , now i have a boil on my back but they ll probably tell me it is a pimple, lol never seen a pimple this big but whatever. lol this is totally unreal, this is like my own personal hell im going through.

							My wife is from the Philippines.  Her family is extremely poor.  We support them 100% with as much as we can.  

3 weeks ago we found out mom (60 years old) has cancer.  She 1st had papsmear (1st in her life), then ultrasound, then biopsy.  Doctor stated she has Stage 3B, with 3-6 months to live or 6-12 months to live with chemo/radiation therapy.  My wife works at a hospital in the XRay department.  She knows a few docs who told her that with chemo/radiation therapy mom could live 5-6 years.  

----Why are 2 doctors so far apart in life expectancy?----

We are trying to make a decision.  Mother and family in PI are very uneducated and have really no idea about what is wrong.  So we have to make the decision for her.

My wife wants to go back and see her mother.  We will be able to do this in mid April.  My wife wants mother to have chemo after my wife leaves to come back to US, so that her time with mom will not be as bad.

							Hi Betty, sorry the nausea is bothering you. Do let your doctor know as there are other drugs that can be used. Others I have heard talk about nausea say it is important to keep something in the stomach all the time -- bland things like applesauce and soda crackers, maybe a handful of dry crereal like Cheerios or Oatmeal Squares. I am sure you will hear from those with first-hand knowledge. Hugs, Lauri

							Call your doctor.  I suffered for 2 days not even being able to hold down a sip of water.  They changed my meds and the new meds worked.  They told me that different things worked for different people.   Lauri is also right about eating frequently and small amounts....keep something in your stomach.  Bland foods are better.  Jello worked well for me.  Also, smells would make me feel nauseated.  Good luck with it!!

							Hi,
You've gotten good advice.  There are more nausea meds now then even when I went through it 3 years ago.  Also, I found if I ate something like baked chicken, it stopped the nausea.  The last thing I thought about was eating, thinking it would make me feel worse, but it made me feel so much better.
I know work is important, but chemo is going to keep you fatigued.  Don't overdue it.  Listen to your body and when it says rest, you need to.  You'll have good days that you'll be able to work and feel like it more then likely, just don't push yourself.  Yor body is going through alot.

I had the same chemo you did except mine was FEC.... I had the epirubensin where you're having the Adriamycin (sp).  It's in the same family.  I got mine every 3 weeks and it seemed to have been worse for me the 2nd day and depending on which # treatment I was on, the days would change, but I always had some good days.

Definately call the onco.

Take care and before you know it, you'll be writing saying that you're done with chemo

I feel for you!  So sorry you are struggling with the nausea.

I had LOTS of nausea on A/C.  I was on Kytril and Compazine and they never worked that well for me.

Many ladies have posted that Emend and Aloxi (sp?) are excellent drugs.  Have you tried those?  I agree you have to speak with your doctor about this.

Nancy's right about the chicken.  LOL  I went on a rotisserie chicken binge for most of chemo. Didn't want to cook the darn thing myself.  LOL  Eat what appeals to you and stick with that.

Good luck and hugs.  The light at the end of that tunnel will soon be seen.

							I am so glad that you are giving great recommendation to British. That is right, there are many types of medications for nausea and vomiting. Usually physicians start with the ""cheap"" ones like Reglan and move on to Zofran or Kytril (a lot more expensive). My experience has been that the expensive ones do provide better results. The mechanisms are different of course.  The other point to make is that Kytril can be taken once a day, so more convenient for people who have a busy schedule.

							Check with your onco about samples.   I tried Compazine (sp) and it didn't help, but the others that Dr. Lu mentioned did.  They were about $40 a pill BUT I got samples all through chemo, I never had to pay for a RX.  Most people I've talked to also were given samples from their onco if they didn't have an insurance card that only required you to pay like a $15.00 co pay.

							Hi Betty:

I agree with everyone.  I was on 4 treatments of A/C and took Zofran religiously, even setting the alarm in the middle of the night to make sure I took it as directed.  I only needed to take it the day after treatment and had very little nausea.  Everyone is different but I would talk to your onc.  There are too many good nausea drugs out there to suffer needlessly.  Also, as everyone else has said, make sure you eat several small meals/snacks to keep food in your stomach.  You may not feel like eating but I found that if I started to feel nausious, and it wasn't time to take another pill, if I ate jello, crackers, toast, or something simple it alleviated the nausea and I felt much better.  Our thoughts are with you.

							I am so sorry that you are going through this, I know only to well how bad this can be once it starts really hard to stop.  I had to try to numerous meds.. finally settled with kytril and ativan, during the infusion and on a steady schedule after that.  However that kytril was only used for four days and then took torrecan and ativan for a few days more.  I had really bad nausea.  Some of the info that I can give you is this.  Make sure that you take the meds even if you do not think that you will need them.  Marion is right, you need to stay on top of the nausea before it starts it is so much easier to control if you can avoid it in the first place.  I also drank lots and lots of water, hydration helps with it too.  As far as food goes.. I ate alot of ""comfort foods"", lived on grilled cheese and mac. and cheese..I also found that If I sucked on hard candy, especially life savers tropical fruit flavored it helped to keep the yuckies away, as well as chewing bazooka bubblegum, what can I say a kid at heart   other then that advice the only other thing that I can say is hang in there... my prayers and thoughts are with you!

I have posted on this subject before......but what I am looking for is an answer to a very specific question.....I'm hoping you will be able to help.

Aromasin/exemestane works in a different way from the other aromatase inhibitors; it is both steroidal and its effects are irreversible.Indeed, it is described in some literature as an aromatase inactivator.

My question is - what exactly does it signify that its effects are irreversible? Does this mean that when I stop taking it, the aromatase enzyme will still be inactivated? What implications might this have for my future well-being ?

If you could explain this to me, I would be very grateful.

							Gene expression profile predicts breast cancer metastases

Reuters Health
Posting Date: February 17, 2005

Last Updated: 2005-02-17 18:30:23 -0400 (Reuters Health) 

NEW YORK (Reuters Health) - Researchers have identified a gene expression signature that is a powerful predictor of distant metastases in patients with lymph node-negative breast cancer.

""Since only 30% to 40% of untreated lymph node-negative patients develop tumor recurrence, our prognostic signature could provide a powerful tool to identify those patients at low risk, preventing overtreatment in substantial numbers of patients,"" senior author Dr. John Foekens, from Erasmus Medical Center in Rotterdam, the Netherlands, and colleagues note. 

As reported in the February 19th issue of The Lancet, the researchers analyzed 22,000 RNA transcripts from breast cancer samples to identify an expression profile that predicted metastases. The samples came from 286 patients with node-negative disease.

Using a training set of 115 tumor specimens, the authors identified a 76-gene signature that predicted distant metastases. Subsequent testing of this signature in a set of 171 lymph node-negative patients yielded a sensitivity and specificity of 93% and 48%, respectively.

The profile was found to be useful in predicting metastatic disease even after adjusting for traditional prognostic factors. Moreover, the signature was particularly good at predicting metastases within 5 years; patients with the signature were nearly six times more likely to develop metastases than patients lacking this profile.

The investigators found that the signature was a strong predictor of metastases regardless of menopausal status and also performed well in patients with tumors between 10 to 20 mm, a group that has traditionally proved to be a prognostic challenge.

In a related editorial, Dr. Tor-Kristian Jenssen, from PubGene AS in Vinderen, Norway, and Dr. Eivind Hovig, from the Norwegian Radium Hospital in Montebello, note that although the current study represents the largest of its kind to date, ""it may still be too small to provide a final selection of genes for signature inclusion. Thus, the signature is there, but it is still necessary to read the fine print.""

							The future looks so promising. I do have to recognize and admit that as a stage 1 node-negative who has had chemo, rads and some tamoxifen, today instead I would look to the future and skip the chemo in hope that the future test is not far away, since my benefit is only a few percentage points.

							I cannot agree more with Leo. This type of result needs to be interpreted with great caution, especially by a lay person. Usually the news reporter does not really understand what is the difference between a pilot study, basic science study, and a clinical trial.  Before deciding one starting a test or stopping a medication, a patient really should talk to the oncologist.

							Absolutely, Drs. Leo and Lu. I am not ungrateful for the expertise both of you have or that my oncologist has. You see patients from one end of the spectrum of cancer to the other, and I don't. 

However, in the entire course of just my personal experience with cancer I have yet to meet a single health care provider who has personally had cancer, much less chemotherapy. I think that is why not a single one of them has ever taken the time to provide even a brief, perfunctory description of what it is like to be neuter as a direct result of choosing therapy. Maybe they genuinely don't have the time; but neither did they provide me with any reading material about it, or any referral to any other entity that would provide counseling for the impacts from chemotherapy that are outside their area of specialization.

I do not think it is legitimate for medical people to act ""in my best interests"" in this regard. I would bet that you don't either, or you would not be kind enough to allow this discussion here. 

I am appreciative of this forum and dialogue if in any way it ends up meaning that even just one person who is diagnosed has a genuine opportunity to make a more informed decision than I had, no matter what choice they make in the end. And they certainly shouldn't put much credibility in a very preliminary report about a test that might be available somewhere off in the future.

							I was thinking the same thing about oncos or surgeons who have never gone through chemo and obviously have the medical knowledge of what works best and lay out a treatment plan that's best for the individual.  There are 5 or 6, can't remember, at the cancer institute I do to and when there is a new patient, they all sit down and go over all the info from the path report, age, etc. and decide what the best treatment plan is, which I think is great, even though I have total faith in mine and he's head of oncology there.  The ironic thing is both of the rads oncos at the cancer institute I go to have both had cancer.  One was a childhood cancer and can't remember what kind, but he wasn't expected to make it and here, 20 years later he's helping others.  The weird thing is, as he's proof that stats don't mean squat and everyone is different, he has a gloom and doom attitude if, in my case Stage III.  You'd think that he'd be more encouraging considering his past.  I don't want or expect someone to lie to me about prognosis, but the way he put it, I wasn't going to be around long.  That isn't what I needed at the time, so I switched.  The other rads onco was dx with prostate cancer after I had gone through treatment and he got radiation, that capsule thing.  Before and after that, he was the same, honest but encouraging and I only see him once a year now, but each year I make it without a reoccurence, he sincerely is so pleased and once again, says the longer you go without one, the better your chances of not having one, even though as we've discussed, all the written material says our chances go up between 5 and 10 years and that has yet to make sense to me, but no one can explain why the articles say it.

							Oncologists are the ones who have to open the door to things we would rather not experience, so being mad at them for it is real.

I felt closest to my onc when I read about some of the things he has done in his field that showed real professional integrity. I also found the book, The Anatomy of Hope, by Jerome Groupman, took away a lot of the hard feelings for me. I'm going to have to read it again.

I know each ""case"" of breast cancer is presented at tumor board where it gets discussed and a treatment plan is developed, but without somone there like an endocrinologist and a psychiatrist/psychologist how can they possibly make an educated plan?

A.A.
						

"
"


							I may be misunderstanding what you're saying.

I was never mad at my oncologist, he was there to do everything possible to save my life.  He came highly recommended, is the head of oncology and goes all over the U.S. giving lectures and has alot of articles in medical journals etc.

If they have been practicing long at all, they can see the devistation and fear in all of us that are dx.  They don't know how it feels because they haven't walked in our shoes, but they have seen it enough.  My PCP never suggested an anti-depressant or meds for anxiety.  It was my onco who saw me get to a point that he knew I needed something.  He was aware of the divorce mess that started right before my dx, well right before my biopsy and knew both that and the dx were taking it's toll.  He put me on Paxil and it helped more then words can say.

If I don't make it to a ripe old age because this mess comes back, it won't be for his lack of trying and his knowledge and determination to save as many as he possibly can.  He wanted the divorce over before I started treatment because the extra stress of a court battle would only hinder my health and chances and was willing to treat me without me having insurance (I would have lost it or had to pay for COBRA and I wasn't able to work) and it not costing me anything.  I would have gotten the exact treatment I got, but the divorce drug on and it's still going on 3 years later, but that's another story.  His primary concern was me and kicking some cancer butt.

This is to announce that Cancer Forums has partnered with Dr. J Lu who has been a regular contributor. With that in mind, we developed a new website called Cancer Online. This website was developed to be a repository of articles about cancer, and will be updated frequently.

We are integrating Cancer Forums with Cancer Online. Now we can offer a few things for our users, such as:

- a weekly Newsletter, with news about Cancer and short articles. To subscribe, go here
- Once the user is signed up, he/she can have his/her own blog.  A blog is an area where the user can post, and it works essentially like a journal. You can check my own blog here.
- There are many articles about most common cancers, and articles about general aspects of cancer, such as treatment and diagnosis.

We will be expanding this website even further. It is in its initial stages of development, and it will continue to grow.

We are also looking for contributors. You can post about anything you would like, and write short articles that will be added to the website.

							I'm only 49 and just completed 6 weeks of radiation for a small breast cancer tumor. Doctor prescribed Armidex, but after I did some research on my own, I found that both it and tamoxifen are for post-menopausal women, which I'm not. 
When I called the doctor about it, he said, ""Oh, I wasn't aware that you weren't through menopause (which I know I did tell him - twice!). So he says ""Well, you need to have a hysterectomy or radiation to your ovaries or we can give you a pill every three months to induce menopause).
I find this hard to believe! I'm sure there's a lot of women out there much younger than me who have had breast cancer but didn't have to be ""manually"" forced through menopause!
I have placed calls to other cancer organizations to get some answers, but I haven't gotten any response yet.
Has anybody encountered this situation? Any advice? Any suggestions on who else to call?

							Hi Pam, welcome to the board. Sorry you need to be here, and sorrier yet that you are in such a difficult situation. I know that Tamoxifen is sometimes prescribed for women who are not in menopause. I have a Michigan ""breast friend"" who is in her late 30s and is just finishing her 5 yrs on tamoxifen -- and she is certainly not menopausal. I certainly would not think that you need a hysterectomy when nothing is wrong with your uterus or ovaries. Oncs sometimes put women into ""chemo-pause"" during treatment using drugs to shut down the production of hormones. I suspect this is what your doctor referred to when he suggested a pill every three months. We have gals here at every stage of treatment and at every age, so I am sure you will hear from some of them. In addition, one or both our our resident doctors may respond to your questions. Here is an excellent web site with information on Tamoxifen.

							Hi,
I was 43 when dx and since I wasn't MENTALpausal, the onco put me on Tamoxifen which is for ladies that are NOT through menopause.  After 6 months once I completed treatment and I never had a period again, he did a blood test to determine that chemo had put me into menopause and then I was switched to Arimidex.  He is right, Arimidex is for post menopausal ladies only, but Tamoxifen is for ladies who are not post.  I asked my onco about having my ovaries removed to get rid of more hormones since I was Stage III, young and high risk and there was nothing that pointed him in the direction that it would be a benefit to me and saw no reason to put me through that.
I have heard of ladies that were given something and put into menopause, but if I remember, they were the ones that hadn't had a period in a year and were on Arimidex and since that is only for post menopausal ladies, they were given whatever the med was to put them into menopause so they could continue the Arimidex.
It's all so confusing.  Best wishes

							Nancy, it is interesting that my onc put me on tamoxifen even thought I had not had a period in more than 2 years. My PCP told me I was not technically in menopause, but I had stopped menstruating. Puzzling, indeed.  Lauri
						

"
"


							That is strange.  I had always heard from other ladies that their docs told them if they hadn't had a period in one year, they were considered post menopausal.  Of course because of my age and it had only been 6 months since treatment, he did the blood test to see if I was post or not.  I asked the lab tech how they could tell and he said there would be one hormone either present or not, can't remember which, and that would tell them.  I couldn't have switched had I not had that blood test to Arimidex.

I'm still amazed at the GYNs that try to put BC survivors who are er/pr+ on HRT.

							Pam -
 Tamoxifen is for pre- AND post-menopausal women......Aromatase inhibitors  (of which arimidex is but one) are for post-menopausal women only.It is that simple.

You can take tamoxifen right now without anything else being ""done"" to you.
You could get ovarian ablation or zoladex shots to shut down your ovaries if you wish to take arimidex.

Most pre-menopausal women are on tamoxifen.(There are usually other circumstances where ovarian shut-down + an aromatase inhibitor is recommended).

							Hi everybody,
This topic aways confuses me.  First like Sam says, Tamox is for pre-menopausal women.  If your doctor feels strongly about using the arimidex there is a lupron shot that can shut down your ovaries.  I choose not to do this because I didn't want to mess around with anything else in my body. 
I am 44 and was dx in when I was 42 and chemo put me in menopause.  However I would like to also say that someone else mentioned on this thread that you are likely considered post menopausal if you have no period for a year.  Well I had no period for 15 or so months, then the flood gates opened and my GYN tested my hormone levels and I came back pre-menopausal.  I had my period for three months now I have missed it again for almost 3 months.  MY GYN ran the hormone levels again and I came back as still pre-menopausal.  So, you always have a chance of getting back your period if you went into forced menopause with the chemo if you are a young age.
So, right now I will stay on the tamox for the full five years and switch over to the Arimidex and have that for a full five years.

							Hey, everyone!
Thanks for getting back to me on my question. I have tried all the cancer associations, the Y-Me hotline and other docs, but this is the first time anyone has told me anything that half-way makes sense.
I handled the initial diagnosis really well and went through radiation pretty smoothly. But this other stuff has me a little frustrated. It's scary to think had I not done my own research, I wouldn't even have known I shouldn't be on the prescribed med or that I needed to do something about shutting down my ovaries.
It makes me wonder what else the doctor didn't tell me that will be a problem down the road.
Please keep writing and if you think of any more advice -- I'm all ears. 

Thanks

							Hi Everybody,
I have a hair question.  To tell you all the truth I thought I was pretty much done with hair issues since my chemo ended Sept 03.  My hair came back really fast and thick.  Different color and different texture at first but it pretty much turned back to normal.
Here is my question.  I noticed the other day that I had not needed to shave my legs or my underarms for what seemed a few weeks.  Then a week later I still noticed I didn't need to at all.  Now I notice my eye lashes and eyebrows really thinning out again.  I am starting to freak out about loosing my hair again.  Has this happened to anybody?  Should I worry about loosing my hair on my head again???   
I thought I was done with hair issues now I am really scared.  At least the first time was explained by chemo, what could explain this?
Thanks all for your help.

							Hi Kristen,
Losing my hair was much more devistating to me then losing my breasts.  The hair under my arms didn't ever grow back, with the exception of 2 or 3, just enough to be aggravating... lol  The hair on my legs grew back alot faster it seemed then on my head, but after about 6 months, I noticed that I didn't need to shave my legs nearly as often and the hair came back, but not all over my legs like before.  I don't remember about my eyelashes and eyebrows.  I didn't lose all of them during chemo, but they thinned out A LOT.  I didn't wear mascara because I was afraid it will weigh down the lashes I had left.  It will be 3 years in June since I had my last chemo, so my memory is fading, thank God!!!  My hair seemed to come back slow, but my hair was half way down my back before, so it would probably seem that way to me because I'd never worn it short.

Are you taking Arimidex?  I know there is a chance your hair can thin on that, but mine never did.  A friend's did, but that didn't last long and then he got back to normal growth.  I'm not sure if Tamoxifen can cause hair loss or not.

My guess is that everything will start growing back normal as far as your lashes go and the % of ladies losing their hair on Arimidex or Tamoxefin, is very low.

							Hi Nancy,
Thanks for the reply.  I am on tamox and have been for 16 months now with no previous hair loss on it.  I have been off chemo since 9/2003 and I was not wearing a hat by Dec 2003.  So my ""new"" hair grew in strong and thick and has been ever since.  I did notice my leg hair and underarm hair was less, but now it seems to be gone.  Almost like no follicles.  I have dirty blonde hair and was never hairy to begin with.  But this new thinning and lack of shaving got me really scared that something was going to happen to my head hair...I was (am) in a panic.
When I lost my hair during chemo it was horrible, but at least I knew it was going to come back and it did.  Maybe because of my cancer experience of loosing all my hair sets me in a panic now like it might happen again with no chemo.  Does this make sense?
So I am curious if the doctors here can explain or if they ever heard of anybody loosing their hair again almost two years after chemo.
I hate these things that get your imagination going wild!!!  
Thanks and I hope to hear more repsonses.

							Kristen ~ Not to worry about the head hair!  

I finished my chemo 14 months ago and have hard VERY LITTLE underarm hair (I'm light and non-hairy, too).  I can still go a couple months and have only a tiny bit of underarm hair.  Before BC I had to shave here once a week in spite of being light-haired.  I have heard ladies on other boards speak of similar experiences.  I have also been on Tamoxifen for 13 months.

I still have to shave my legs much less often, too.

THE GOOD NEWS:  My head hair is still growing, full and healthy.  I just keep thanking my lucky stars the underarm hair loss didn't happen to my head hair!  If I'm going to lose hair, I'd rather lose it under the arms.  LOL

Hugs and here's to healthy hair,

							Dear All,
I think your experiences worth much more than my explanation. 
As you know hair loss is common for patient underwent chemotherapy and radiation treatment (to the head only).  Usually alopecia is reversible, completely reversible, after chemotherapy.  But patients underwent radiation to the head (like whole brain radiation) are not so lucky.
I don?t think patients need to worry about repeated hair loss once they are re-grown.  Usually they don?t get lost just for no reason again.

							Hi Everybody,
I was interested in getting information about gene testing.  I know someone that just got her results back and she tested positive.  She already had breast cancer, so she just went in to remove the ovaries.
If you have no family history that you know of...and I stress THAT YOU KNOW OF....should one get the gene testing.
I have three sisters and two young daughters.  One of my sisters has had  a biopsy which came back negative, but they still watch her every six months with mammo and ultrasound.  
Has anybody here had the gene testing, and if so was it only because of a sister, mother, daughter...etc with either breast or ovarian?  Has anybody had the test with no other relatives having had breast or ovarian?
If my sister should come back as cancer as some point, would I then be in a higher risk and have the testing????
Any feedback would be appreciated!
Thanks again everybody.

							Hi Kristen,
I'm not 100% sure about this, but I'm sure Leo can tell you, but when I was concerned about my neice since I was dx with BC young and if I'm not mistaken, I was told that she would need to be tested, not me since I know I had the gene since I was dx with BC.  I don't think I would have any bearing on her since she's my brother's daughter and it's looked at as far as the maternal side.  My mother is 82 and never had any kind of cancer, her mom, my grandmother died at 86, never any kind of cancer and my aunts on my mom's side died in their late 80s and never any cancer.  I guess I was just lucky....geesh
I can understand your concern having sisters and a daughter and I'd ask your onco when you see him/her next or Leo.  There are alot of sites out there, but you never know which ones are good for accurate and updated info.  I was told by my onco, if I had to look something up, to use WebMD.

Good luck and I hope you get some answers soon to ease your mind.

							OK...I've been going rounds about this topic as well.  Here is what my surgeon and my onc. told me..... They both said that just because I have BC that doesn't mean that I have the BRCA1 or BRCA2 gene.  There are more genes that can contribute to one's risk factor...these are just the ones that have been identified and can be tested for.  And if I test negative, and my daughters and my sister test negative...that does not mean they won't get BC.  And a positive test does not mean that they will get BC, it just increases their risk.  They are already at increased risk simply because I had BC and at an early age (40) and also because my mom had BC at 52 (pre-menopausal).  If I were to be tested and did have the gene I would want to consider whether to have my ovaries removed becasue this gene is also related to ovarian cancer.  One more thing...this gene is more prevalent in women of eastern European descent....my onc. basically told me this test would be no good for certain ethnic groups.  I'm not sure of where my ancestors came from, so that didn't really help me too much.  I still haven't made a decision about it yet.

Hope this makes sense....it's 3:10am and I can't sleep due to anxiety ( I think ) about my chemo tomorrow.    It will be my 3rd AC treatment...only one more to go!!!

							Hello everybody,
Hi Laurie thanks for the link, I will be sure to check it out.  Also I am not new to the board, in fact have been here for a while and I thank god that I found it.  Not only is there great advice from all you ladies, but having access to the doctors ears for answering questions is a huge bonus!

Shelly....yes your post makes perfect sense.  My oncol said that I have about as much chance as having the gene or ovarian cancer that she does (hopefully her chances aren't good)..because of the no family history.  However, my surgical oncol said because I have twin daughters (age 10) that I should be sure that they get checked out early in their life.  This whole gene thing is very confusing.  To tell you the truth, if I tested postive for the gene, I would not even have a second thought about going in and getting ride of the ovaries.  Good luck on your last A/C chemo...I remember it all to well!!

Nancy...I beleive that the person with the breast or ovarian cancer is the one that needs to get the testing done.  From what I know from my friend is that there is only one place that does the testing and it is in Calif..the cost is around 4,000 or so.  If you test positive for the gene then my sisters or daughters could also be tested at the same lab but the cost is only about 300 or 400 dollars because the gene will already be isolated.

But what if you don't know if you have any family history, are you better off to get the gene testing done?  As far as I know I really don't ahve any family history but if one of my sisters should get bc or ovarian, are you then considered to have a family history enough to get tested?

Thanks for all your posts and inputs everybody....

							Kristen,

I've been awake all night so if I don't make sense please excuse me...

My onco. told me about another lab called Myriad.  Here's their website info  -- http://www.myriadtests.com/provider/contacta.htm 
She said they would send out a test kit for you to take to your dr. and have the blood drawn and send back.  They will also work with insurance companies to get approval.

I'm considering getting the testing done because my mother had breast cancer at 52 (before menopause) and she has several cousins that have had it as well.  Then I got it at age 40.  I have a younger sister and 2 daughters (11 and 18 ).  The 18 year old has already been to the gyn and he told her that she would need to begin getting mammos at age 25 and that she needed to be diligent about the yearly check-ups.  I really don't know what more she could do if she found out she had the gene.

Like you, if my test came back positive, I wouldn't hesitate about having my ovaries removed...but I'm older and have already had my children.  It scares me to think of my daughters having to make that decision.

And that brings up another dilemma...
I know several people who have tested positive and have elected to go ahead with a bilateral mast even though there were no signs of BC.  I'm sure this decreases their risk, but by how much???  I guess that's a question for the docs.

Well, I'm running on empty and I have to go and get ready for my appt...maybe I'll be able to sleep right through my chemo...

							Hello

This is a very controversial topic, but I found one source that would merit ones attention:
http://www.pamf.org/health/guideline...screening.html

Basically, they recommend BRCA testing under the following circumstances:




			
				 * Breast cancer under age 45 and a relative with ovarian cancer
    * Breast cancer in both breasts under age 50 and one relative with ovarian or breast cancer
    * Ovarian cancer under age 50
    * Ashkenazi Jewish heritage with breast cancer under age 45

Others would add the following characteristics as meriting the screening:

    * Two sisters, each with breast cancer under age 40 or one with ovarian cancer under age 50
    * Family history of two relatives with breast cancer and one with ovarian cancer
    * Family history of breast or ovarian cancer under age 30
    * Family history of three relatives with breast cancer under age 50
    * Ashkenazi Jewish heritage with ovarian cancer, any age
    * Family history of male breast cancer
			
		

So in the end, few women should really be screened, as the consequences of a positive test are enormous.

							Dear Friends,
I cannot stress enough the importance of talking with a genetics expert prior to deciding for or against genetic testing.  Cancer genetics is an area of medicine which is rapidly evolving--and it's difficult for nonexperts--every physicians and oncologists to stay up-to-date on the informaiton.  I strongly encourage anyone concerned about hereditary cancer or considering genetic testing to make an appointment with a genetic counselor.  You can find a genetic counselor through the National Society of Genetic Counselors at 

http://www.nsgc.org

even if you have decided not to have genetic testing, a genetic counselor can make sure that you can get the best follow-up care.

And FORCE is an organization devoted to hereditary breast and ovarian cancer--feel free to peruse our resource guide and message boards.  Most of the women at our site have had genetic counseling and/or testing and are happy to share their experiences.

Hope this helps.
Warm regards,

							A couple of questions:

1. I had a TAH BSO on 1/25/05.  I'm 51 years old.  Prior to this surgery, I didn't have any symptoms of menopause.  I am almost 4 weeks post op and still no symptoms.  I was told that I might not experience the normal menopause symptoms as I am overweight.  I was also told that I might have gone through menopause but not have known it as I take 0.5 Xanax at night and prn for panic attacks.  Can you comment on that?

2. My surgical staging was Stage 1B/Grade 1.  There was just 1 focus spot into the endometrium.  I've been advised that I don't need chemo or radiation and will be followed for the normal 5 year follow up.  I understand that recurrence could occur in the breast, colon or vaginal cuff.  Of course, I'm not taking any hormones but I'm wondering if I have an increased chance of recurrence due to being overweight as fat cells convert to estrogen, and it's estrogen that feeds the cancer?

Thank you in advance for your help & responses.
						

"
"


							Old age, fat, and nulliparity are risk factors for endometrial cancer. But after the surgery is resected, I am not sure if endogenous estrogen is still a risk factor for recurrence for early stage grade 1 uterine cancer since the recurrence is very low. I guess they may increase the risk, but the magnitude should be quite small.

							Hi Vladimir,

Be careful of anything from <LINK DELETED please read our links policy>, They do not check their info.  For example, under Cancell, they repeat this lie told by NCI about their testing of Cancell (brand names Cantron and Protocel):

Cancell/Entelev/Cantron has any effect on cancer or any other disease. The National Cancer Institute (NCI), which is the U.S. government agency responsible for cancer research, conducted animal tests in 1978 and 1980 on Entelev and found no activity against cancer. In 1990 and 1991, NCI examined samples of Cancell and found no response with cancer cells. 

If  <LINK DELETED please read our links policy> had done the slightest investigation, they would have learned that the above statement is an outrageous lie.  The lie is explained on <LINK DELETED please read our links policy> where you can read:

The two day NCI test is designed for fast working chemotherapy agents. Slow working Cancell reduced the mass of half of the 60 tumors tested by 80% or more in just two days. That is incredible performance. Tumor weight data takes up 8 of the 14 columns on the NCI test data sheets, but NCI didn't mention weight loss in their summary. 
Also <LINK DELETED please read our links policy> had no way to contact them to request corrections; they have no accountability.  

Regarding BIOGENIUS.  I have studied alternative cancer treatments for seven years and have not heard of it before you asked.  That does not mean that it isn't a good treatment, that just means that it is not well known.  Also, I find the price of 2650 euros outrageous.  On a different page of the same web site that has the NCI/Cancell expose, Alternative Cancer Treatments Comparison and Testing at <LINK DELETED please read our links policy> you can find a  comparison table on the home page, where you can see that some of the best cancer treatments only cost $35 a month.  This is because they are plant based and plants are cheap.  

On Alternative Cancer Treatments Comparison and Testing you can also read how plant based medicine was destroyed:

Around the begining of the last centruy, Rockefeller and Carnegie obtained control over medical school education through the use of the Flexner Report which was written by Henry Pritchett, who was in the employ of Rockefeller. This report favored only the medical schools that concentrated on using drug-based treatments. These schools started to receive large amounts of money from Rockefeller and Carnegie. In 1905, 160 medical schools were in operation. By 1927, 17 years after the Flexner Report, the number had dropped to 80. From then on, pharmaceutical company control of medical school curriculums was assured by the large amounts of money they would ""give"" to the schools for approved research. That research of course was approved or disapproved by the pharmaceutical companies. Only research that would lead to treatments that could be patented received approval. That eliminated any treatments derived from plants.

I received a much more aggressive chemo treatment again in 04 and 05, for I was able to fight the cancer and beat it, hopefully it won't ever come back ever again.

My name is Sue, I am 38 years old and live in Illinois. I was diagnosed 6/o4 with a 1.9cm, grade 3, invasive ductal ca. Lumpectomy w/negative nodes. I had 4 rounds of chemo and 35 radiation treatments. I started tamoxifin 2 months ago.

My question is does this black cloud that follows me everywhere ever go away. I just can't get the feeling out of my head that there's more cancer in my body. Are these normal feelings?

I see my onc. tomorrow. Hopefully she can put my mind at ease.

							Hi, Sue, welcome to our corner of the internet. I hope you know that the neg. nodes is good news. It is the best indication that the cancer did not travel beyond the breast. The head may know that, but sometimes it's hard to accept that fact. I know.

I sure relate to your feeling of being under a ""black cloud."" That's exactly how I felt, too. At the first anniversary of my diagnosis, I remember too well sitting in my onc.'s office with my head on his desk saying, ""I know I am well, that I am all right, but I don't feel like it. I don't feel hopeful or optimistic."" He suggested I see a therapist for some counseling, and I have been on antidepressants ever since. They help a lot. I know many women who fight cancer-related depression, so it is not that unusual. Don't hesitate to ask for help if you think it might help you. Please stay in touch and let us know how we can help. Hugs, Lauri

							Hi Sue,
There will come a time that you'll think about cancer everyday, but more of a passing thought instead of consuming your thoughts.
You and your onco were very smart for you to take chemo even though you didn't have any positive nodes.  With or without nodes, you never know what will happen, but in my opinion your onco was right in giving you the AC since there is no accurate test that can tell if the cancer had gotten into your blood stream.  She wanted to make sure you had every chance possible to never have to deal with this disease again and the odds are definately in your favor that you won't. 

I was dx Stage III, 5.5 cm tumor and 9+/16 nodes and 3 years later I'm doing well.  My chances are greater then you statically that I'll have a reoccurence, but even us with positive nodes can respond well to chemo and radiation.  It's not an automatic gloom and doom situation.  I think that black cloud will always linger until a Cure is found, but it won't consume your thoughts the more time that passes.

Hang in there girl, you're doing great!!!!!!!! and your thoughts are very normal.  My onco did put me on Paxil during treatment because I was dealing with more then the BC at the time, not to say I wouldn't have needed it anyway.  It's a very emotional and scary time, but treatment has come a long way.

							Hi Sue,

Welcome to our boards!

It's very normal to be haunted by the ""black cloud"" hanging overheard.  However, we have to find a way of dealing with that nasty cloud and not letting it overtake/interfere with our lives -- can't let the cancer win.

Yes, I am ""pollyanna"" and some folks don't like this.  However, what is the alternative  -- negative and miserable?  I find the best way to handle the fears is to come to support boards because people at the boards understand how you feel.  Others who have not gone through it (esp. those close to us) sometimes feel that it's over when the treatments are over.  

I tell myself that I feel good so the cancer IS probably gone.   Also, we have to remind ourselves that most women who are diagnosed and treated will never have a recurrence.  I like to think I am one of those women.

Here is a good support group for younger women:  www.youngsurvival.org 

Many women belong to more than one support group -- you get different things from different groups.  Does that make sense?  LOL  Anyhow, we hope you will continue to post here, but please visit that site, too.  Younger women have very different concerns and issues when confronted with BC.

Take care, good luck and sending hugs,

							Hi Sue and All,

I am new here and I was delighted to find this site. We can all relate well to that dark cloud Sue but in time, it doesnt follow you quite as often. What we new as a normal life before breast cancer no longer exists so we have to move on eventually and create a new normal. In the fullness of time we don't allow cancer to consume us and the goal is to resume quality of life.

I was diagnosed with ILC 6/99 with no node involvement. On 6/2002, I was diagnosed with ILC with no node involvement on the opposite breast as it mirrored itself. I absolutely agree with MuttsMom in that with or without nodes, no one can truly predict because there are many variables to a diagnosis sometimes so everyone is different but treatment indeed is the  best line of defense.

Right now your experiencing post traumatic stress which we can all relate so please know that your feelings are very normal.  Remember to take things one day at a time and in the mean time, your doing great. Your reaching out for emotional support and healing emotionally is most important because when you heal emotionally, you not only survive but you start living again.

Sending mega hugs.......

  Six weeks ago I underwent a radical prostatectomy, the cancer was locally contained within the prostate and a pathology report afterwards confirmed this good news. I have healed well and even have good urinary control, there is however a persistent problem concerning ED. I can attain an orgasm without problem, yet there is no erection, I tried Cialis with no luck. I realize that a man`s orgasm is mind controlled and his erection is completely seperate, more a product of blood flow and nerves. My questions are, Is it too early yet  and will the nerves and blood vessels that were cut regenerate? I would like to hear from other men who have experienced the same thing.

							HI. I too had radical prostrate removal robot assisted and nerve sparing surgery. Now 5 months ago. I have gotten pretty good urinary control, still leak when I sneeze/cough or lift something heavy. 
BUT I have yet to have a ""natural""erection. the pills don't work, the Muse hurts like heck..the only thing that has worked is the ""shot"". With the right dosage it is pretty much like it was before. Orgasm is achievable even with out a erection. Helps to have a understand and helpful woman.
Doctor says to wait a year before thinking it will not get better and then think of other alternatives to the shot.
Right now I am pretty depressed about it, my mind looks at women the way it used to, it really hurts that the body seems like it is not listening.....I'll wait but I am not interested in any mechanical devices being put in... Sure seem like there are a lot more guys with ED than the doctor indicated BEFORE I had the surgery. Guess it could be worse though???

							I too, did not respond to Cialis, nor Viagra for that matter, after RP.  I am doing the injections with Trimix (from a compounding pharmacy) with good results.  The injections are easy to do and the response is almost immediate with a good erection.  Don't let the needle put you off--you can use the small, short ones used by diabetics so it is painless.  This approach is also more economical than the Cialis type drugs which are only guaranteed to make the drug companies rich.  Why get depressed about not having an erection when it is so easy with injection?  I have to drive 30 miles to a compounding pharmacy but I get 30+ injections for about $50.

							Hello,
Feels good to be here!!
My wife, Vaishali was diagnosed with Breast cancer, a month after the birth of our second daughter. The gynaec in India, mistook the lump as a milk knot, and finally when we had it right, she was in stage 3. We had the mastectomy done, and there were 3 runds of Epirubicin (hope i have spelled it right) prior to the surgery. The surgery was followed with another dose of Epirubicin and then followed by 6 does of DoceTaxel(Taxotere). We were glad to get over with the chemos, and were preparing ourselves for radiation, when lesions were found in her liver. The Doctor says, that inspite of the top of the class dose of taxo, if the cancer is striking back then another round of chemo, may not be of any use. In short he says, allopathy may not have more to offer her.
There is a Homeopathic Doctor who is fairly confident of arresting the cancer growth, and we are thinking of getting over with allopathy and move to Homeopathy.
We are in double minds as if we start with Homeopathy then we cannot have interference form allopathy. At the same time, allopathy is not offering any promises but another round of chemo, and the Docotr says there is very little chance of success.
What do I do, where do I go / Anybody, with any experience in this? has anybody tried Homeopathy at all? I will very much appreciate  your inputs.
Thanks and good luck to you all.

							Welcome, Vinayak, We are getting to be a real intenational community on this site. Sadly, breast cancer knows no ethnic or geographic boundaries.

I have no expertise with homeopathic treatments. Most of the women I know have used conventional chemo therapy. There are a number of drug cocktails being used here in the United States, but I do not know if they are available in India. Nor, do I know about your access to choices in medical providers. I would certainly hope you could find a doctor willing to go the extra distance in finding treatments for your wife. I had a good friend who survived five years after being diagnosed at Stage IV. So, I would hope there might be help for your wife. Dr. Leo has assembled some good resources here for you to explore. Another useful web site is www.imaginis.com. Sending warm wishes and prayers for your wife, Lauri

She went the homeopathic route and did tremendously well.  It is now 10 years later and she is doing great.  She swears by the homeopathic doc.  I do know that she had to travel to some other country to get some of her treatments.  That's really all I know about it, sorry I cannot be of more help to you.

							Hi, my friend was diagnosed with endometrial cancer about two months ago.  Before the surgery, the best they could gather from biopsy and MRI was that it as a late stage I cancer.  She had a hysterectomy about two weeks ago and we got the pathology reports yesterday.  It showed that a cyst on the ovary was also cancerous and it showed carcinoma in the aortic lymph node, one of 19 they removed and checked.  It is now staged at IIIC.  We haven't been able to talk to the doctor yet because he's on vacation, but what we hoped would be fairly manageable and survivable now seems extremely scary.  She's also 28 years old.  What does this new development mean in terms of treatment and prognosis?  Any thoughts or references would help.  Thank you.

							Dear Moon

Thanks for posting. We have some information on endometrial cancer here: http://canceronline.com/taxonomy/term/18 (this is our sister site)

							Dear Moon,

Sorry to hear of the diagnosis.  I just joined this forum.  It seems like the forum administrator is very helpful.  FYI:  if youre looking for more  emotional support there is a good support group at CancerCare.org.

I was dx with adenocarcinoma of the uterine endomtrium 4/03.  I had a complete radical hyst.  I too had lymph node involvement.  In addition to surgery I had radiation (29 sessions) and 6 months of chemo.  I got into a clinical trial, I believe it was GoG 184.  I was on a good protocol that made the chemo easier to manage.  My chemo was cisplatin and adromyicin.  For nausea, Zofran works well.  I have a 50/50 diagnosis for 5 year survivol.  I'm one year in remission, checks every 3 months.  

Im 47, so Im relatively young for this disease.  It was misdiagnosed several times, since the main symptom is vaginal bleeding...at age 46 they thought it was just peri menopausual irregular bleeding or fibriods.  A biopsy is the only way to really find out.  I urge every woman with irregular bleeding to insist on a biopsy.  This cancer is easy to treat in early stages, but more difficult later.

With good doctors and good support, you can make it.

Best of luck to you,

							Hi moon.I was just wondering how they diagnosed her.I am going to my doctor right now I had a ct done feb.21 and it showed 2 ovarian cysts one on each ovary.I have had a history of cysts since age 17 I am now 29.But also on the ct they seen a solid mass in the uterine cavity.I took all that to my gyny today he said he did not feel anything in my uterus and said that 1 year ago there was nothing in there I at that time had a ultrasound.1yr ago. but now this. he said he didn't think it was a fibroid.Like the radiologist report said. He ordered a hyterogrma to look inside.I was just wondering if any of this happend to her?

							I was just wondering...some people tend to have a great attitude where their health is concerned and they tend to look for the positive things....and others, well let's just say they tend to dwell on the negatives.  I'm not talking about anyone here in this forum...this is mainly coming from people in my family who have other health problems.  I'm just wondering if there have ever been any studies done on people's attitude towards being ill and their outcome.

I have 2 cousins...sisters....both were struck with illnesses.  The older was was diagnosed with MS at age 34.  She just basically threw up her hands and said, OK...I'm done.  She went on disability and has blamed everything on her illness ever since.  Thing is, she's fine, she can do everthing that I can do.  The other sister was stuck with an airborne virus (Can't remember the name of it...something myolitis) that affected 18 inches of her spine and basically paralyzed her.  She was told by the neurologist that she would never walk again.  She said...Oh no...I've got to, I've got 4 small boys....and she changed doctors.  It took her a while but she is now walking, driving, etc.  all to the amazement of all of her doctors.  She does have to use a cane sometimes and she had to learn to drive with hand controls, but she's doing great.  I just wonder if her attitude about the whole thing brought her through it and if she would have had the same result if she'd had her sister's attitiude.

I try to keep a good attitiude about everything.  When people ask me if I've been sick, I always say yes but I have my good days and I enjoy those tremendously.  I always try to look for something good in every situation.  Someone on another post referred to themself as ""polyanna"" but I think that's a great way to be.  Beats the heck out of dwelling on the bad stuff!!

Something just got me to thinking about all this...
						

"
"


							Thanks  for posting, Shelly. I do think a positive attitude is important. You have graphic evidence in your own family. What a different attitude can make. I have a husband that always looks for the worst in any situation and always expects things to go wrong for him. His whole family was that way. On the other hand, I tend to expect things to work out for the best. 

I don't know about scientific studies, but I would suspect that a positive attitude goes a long way in helping people recover from surgery and/illness. And, you are so right. Being optimistic does beat the heck out of the alternative. It is so much easier to smile than frown. Hugs, Lauri

							Hello

This is a great thread. Attitude definitely makes a big difference. It also spreads to others around you, regardless of whether it is a good or bad attitude.

I encourage people to try to read something about it that can help someone look at things from a different angle. There is always something to be learned, even from the worst situations.

"
"


							That question seems simple but I don't think the answer is that simple.

There is a sort of hidden cruelty about expectations. A while back in one of the online bc support groups I tune into there was quite a discussion about this. I don't know if I have any of it saved somewhere in my files to be able to give it to you without my interpretation of it, but for now you get the short AlaskaAngel version. 

There is a genuine need to acknowledge what is good and what is bad about things that happen. If you take the position that focusing on the good leads to a better outcome then to some degree you are also taking the position that anyone who has a bad outcome probably simply hasn't put enough faith or energy into thinking positive. That is a destructive thing to do to people because there are genuine limits to what ""thinking positive"" can accomplish.

A minor example: Personally I did find it offensive during my course of treatment when someone else had almost no nausea or vomiting whereas I was having a very different experience. Positive thinking wasn't dealing with reality. Another example would be recurrence and the focus of blaming oneself for simply not thinking positively enough to keep cancer at bay.

I read Mind Over Menopause, The Complete Mind/Body Approach to Coping with Menopause, to try to explore positive thinking. I found a number of interesting and helpful aspects to the book, but it deals almost entirely with natural menopause and not chemical or surgical menopause, which means it pretty much leaves out women who have some of the most need for a book about being positive about menopause. It is of course simpler for them not to deal in any depth with the more difficult forms of menopause. For that I probably could be accused of ""thinking negatively"". On the positive side, hopefully they will correct this omission sometime soon and put out a book entirely devoted to chemopause and surgipause?

A.A.
						

"
"


							I see your point...sometimes the outcome is gonna not be good, but I think if you focus your energy on the negatives it makes you miserable.  I always try to look for something positive in every situation and sometimes...like with the nausea....the only positive was feeling better after it was over.  The thing I was getting at is that some people just kind of give up and decide it's over....I'm of the opinion that if you're going down, you go down fighting...

							Hi Shelley:

I had the opportunity to be a part of a study that was being conducted by a university to determine just this.  The only problem was when you signed up you didn't know which group you would be put into -- the group that was allowed to have support via family, friends, internet, hospital support groups, etc., or the group that could not have any support.  It was a ten year study I believe.  They were going to follow the women through their treatment, recovery, and recurrence (if any) and then compare.  All the women had to be in stage II or less with tumors smaller than 5 cm, lymph node involvement, chemo and radiation treatment, specific age range, etc.

I chose not to participate because I truly believe support provides the best outcome and recovery and I didn't feel I could take the risk of being put into the group that would not be allowed to have support.  I felt for my own sake and the sake of my family I owed it to them and myself to do whatever I could to have the best outcome.  I admire those women who took part and were willing to be put into the non-support group for the good of all us with this disease.

It will be interesting one day to see what the outcome is of this study.

							I went to the link that you gave and read the article.   What I was saying was not that positive attitude was the only way to be....Lord knows, I have myself a pity party every now and then....but I do think that it's more beneficial, at least to me, to look for the good things rather than the bad.  And some people really get bogged down in the negatives.  I'm more of a positive person by nature and some people are just more negative by nature....nothing wrong with that, just the way they are.  Believe me, I do sometimes feel sorry for myself, but I get over it in a bit and go on.  I'm not saying being positive will cure  it but it sure makes it easier to deal with.
						

"
"


							Yes -- it is natural and ""okay"" to feel down when faced with adversity. Different people have different ways of handling stress -- some by putting on a happy face, some by becoming a little more contemplative and quiet, etc. The article explained it much better than I did. Some people are so polite or reserved that it takes feeling very negative before they will get mad enough to try to do something about their situation, while others have to focus on the positive to be able to ""see"" what alternatives might be available or believe in their ability to try. 

And not everyone believes ""fighting"" to the end is the right thing to do in their personal situation, which is a deeply personal decision that can be honored. It is hard to know when to try to hold onto someone and when to let go.

   I am 23 years old and was diagnosed with lymphoma when I was 17.  I went into remission after 6 months of treatment, only to be rediagnosed 1 year after my original diagnosis date.  My oncologist did a very grueling routine of chemotherapy which landed me numerous hospital stays and transfusions the 2nd go round.  After all of the chemo came radiation.  I have been in remission once again for 4.5 years.  I have now continued my life, but am faced with ""chemo brain"".  My short-term memory is shot, along with some long-term. Somedays are better than others, but I need help.  My oncologist says I should get better, but it seems I am only getting worse after 4 years. It doesn't just mess with your memory, it also deals with my confidence.   My regular doctor is wonderful  and we have been trying to figure out a way to maintain, rebuild, or lessen my memory loss.  I know there have been a lot of new studies on this subject, but most of them are just studies, no answers.  Do you or anyone else have any input on this subject?  [/quote]

							Thanks, Leo.   I live in Indianapolis and very familiar with Lilly.   The reason I'm interested in CBA Pharma is toxicity.  I've heard that their CBT1 has limited to no side effects.   My family member has become drug resistant but most efforts to neutralize the pump have been too toxic.   I did follow your links and spoke with the company.   To my dismay, you have to have been chemo naive to participate in their trial.  Therefore, if you've taken chemo before, you don't qualify.   Very frustrating.

what i know about cbt1 comes from a friend close to the actual producers of the drug. it apparently is produced from an asian plant. so far, it shows no ill side effects & has passed years of clinical testing.  it is listed as a MRD, multiple resistance drug, which as i understand it means it changes the molecular structure of cancer cells in order for the cells to to withstand chemotherapy treatments, thus making the treatment quicker & less in frequency. cb1 if currently awaiting FDA approval, which as we all know, could take a very extended period of time for obvious reasons. wish this treatment had been around for my dad's terminal bladder cancer  jasper18

Made appointment with hem/onc. he said that he couldn't notice it, but his nurse did.  The discoloration got more prevelent, went to my regular md and they contacted my hem/onc, she wanted more tests to be ran and wanted the hem/onc to re-check.  Since have not heard from hem/onc.  He says that it can't possibly be from my meds and doesn't seem to want to look into it any further.  Should I be concerned and press the issue or could it just be a simple side effect.  Also have severe joint pain and always tired.  Any information or suggestions would be greatly appreciated.  Thank you.

Sorry to hear you are having these problems. This can be due to jaundice, an accumulation of a pigment called bilirubin in the blood. It may be hard to detect by looking if the levels are not high enough. Not knowing if this is the case or not, the doctors may or may not have done tests looking for it. 

I would not think anagrelide could cause it, but try to find out what the blood tests showed.

							My uncle, just today, recieved news that he has about 6 months to 18 months to live. He has adenocarcinoma of the lung that spread to his liver(stage IV). However,his doctors say he is too weak to recieve any treatment and as we believe, is in his last resort for help. He is scheduled to go to chemo in about two weeks at low doses, I assume. (The doctors say that after two treatments they will be able to tell if it is helping. However this is for his Lung and not the liver..they cannot treat??..I am confused) I am not sure of any other details due to my mother telling me and being too upset. I was just wondering if any one has heard of any affective ""alternative"" treatments that may work. i was also wondering if, by chance due to his condition, that he should get a second opionion? I am very upset as well as my mother and I am just looking for any hope. He has had a long history of heart and lung problems which probably does not help his condition but There has to be something out there!! Thanks for the advice!!!

Also, I had my nodes removed end of June. Just recently, under my arm  has become very sore . I just started walking again, about 3 miles 3-4 times a week. I wasn't sure if that could make it so sore. Is this normal?

I go for my first mammogram since my diag next week, I'm a bit scared .
My sister was recently diagnosed and they were not able to detect one of her tumors on mamm or ultrasound.

Thanks for listening,

I had 4 rounds of AC, every 3 weeks. I saw my radiation oncologist on Tuesday and he has ordered a ct scan and a bone scan, because the pain by my breast has gotten worse. He thought it was possibly inflamation from the radiation. 

My mammogram was fine. Now I just have to get through these next 2 tests, I'm confident all will be fine.

							i notice that i 6 swollen nodes all over my body... first 2 swollen nodes was felt on the back my right upper tigh,  then after a while another 2 in the front of left upper tigh, and then again later 1 more on the side of my left stomache and recently 1 on my left wrist,  . They are about 0.3-0.5 wide. Those on my right tighs feels unconfortable and sometimes aching. 

I have done some research on the internet and what i see is terrifing. Can someone explain to me what is happening to me ??

 i have seen a doctor and he say that its normal without even thoroghly check me. & i was told the only way to remove these nodes is by surgery.

							Unless your lymph nodes are excessively swollen, usually it is something that will go away in a few days or weeks. It is your immune system doing what it is supposed to do by protecting you from viruses and bacterias. It is scary to suddenly become aware of something different about your body and not know what is causing it, but a lot of times we are exposed to illnesses and we do not know it nor get the disease because our bodies are really good at protecting us unless we abuse our body. Good luck to you.

							I don't think anyone here can tell what these nodes are and you should talk to your physician again. What worries me was that they told you it was OK without performing a thorough examination. It seems you need another examination.

Had went for biopsy and remove some of the nodes..during the follow up of the surgery the doctor said there's nothing wrong  and the lumps are non cancerous..  according to him its normal for some pple to have lumps all over the body... 

is there any way to stop this lumps from coming out is there any treatment for this .. my doctor recommendation is just to leave it alone cause its non cancerous... i dunt feel comfotable with these lumps and afraid that more will grow...

							It won?t be easy to answer your questions since we do not have much information. However, one rule of thumb is that if radiation was give for definitive treatment (usually high dose was used), re-treatment is not a good idea because the body cannot tolerate high dose of radiation. Sometimes re-irradiation can be done if the previous dose will be limited, radiation fields will be small, no critical tissue will be included in the field, or special technique can be used.

							My Mom has lung cancer and it has metastasized to her liver.  She is in the advanced stage of small cell lung cancer.  She has gotten in real bad shape over the last few weeks.  Her feet have swollen up so much, I can barely distinguish her toes.  I asked the nurse why and she said it has to do with the liver failure.  I didn't keep up with biology or whatever ology in school but I was wondering how would the failure of her liver make her feet and legs swell up so bad?

							Dear Paul

Thanks for posting. Sorry to hear about your mother. If this is indeed liver failure, the reason that one can have swelling (edema) is due to the low proteins in the blood, as the liver produces many of the proteins, mostly albumin. These proteins ""attract"" fluids by osmosis, so when the proteins are low the fluids just do not stay where they should, and ""spill"" to other areas of the body.

							I also have the swelling in both feet, but it is the arm that amazes me.  I have non-small cell lung cancer and have stopped taking treatments after a 9 month haul.  During that time, I developed a blood clot in my upper right arm, which is now being controled by needle.  The pressure gets so bad that my arm actually leaks the liquid through the pours.

He has stopped chemo, and never was a candidate for radiation. He was  recently hospitalized for a blood clot in the lung (he was having trouble breathing and went to er), he is home now, and on pain meds. Could the swelling be a result of the clot, or could it be indicative of liver failure? He is hospitalized once again because they are concerned about heart failure. Obviously the prognosis is grim, but could anyone tell me if these are the symptoms that one experiences cloeser to death? The doctors aren't saying, and I'm just trying to prepare for what's to come. Thank you for your help.

							I was diagnosed with cirhosis nearly four years ago. Past October I had a CT-Scan and the doctor informed me I had three or four spots on my liver about the diameters of golf balls. He said they had probably been there for some time.

He informed me those spots might be cancerous and the only way to know for certain was to have a liver biopsy. I declined on the spot.

The reason for this is that in the past I was a member of a visitaion committee for a service organization in which I went to various hospitals to visit members of our organization or their kin who were hospitalized for one reason or another. I recall more than a few older men (I am sixty eight) that did not fair well at all after having surgeries on their vital organs; liver, gall bladder, kidnies etc. etc. In fact some of them worsened and did not live long afterwards even though their operations had been successful.

My doctor did not attempt to convince me one way or the other as to whether I should elect to have the biopsy or not. He simply replied that he believed it was a ""sane decision."" This was in October and he suggested I have another CT-Scan this month, February.

Ironically when I appeared for my appointment Thursday he still had not returned to work as a result of surgery. I was seen by another doctor and he also asked me about the biopsy. I again said no.

But unlike my regular doctor this one said something like ""Well, I'm pretty sure you have liver cancer. And if you decline treatment you are going to die."" Because I declined the biopsy he saw no need for the second CT-Scan and it was not scheduled.

He said they would continue to treat me ""clinically"" and that would be that.

I have been taking several medications daily since the cirhosis was diagnosed years ago. I feel absolutely fine and have exhibited none of the symptoms associated with liver cancer so far.

Although I am not dwelling upon it, I am curious to know what I can expect if this is cancer and what will I feel when it begins to take its toll. Will I simply waste away gradually over days and weeks, will I suffer excruciating pain? Will I just drop dead suddenly?

I have been divorced for 18 years and all my children are grown and successful. I have not mentioned anything to them and I do not intend to.

When my doctor presented me with the news in October and I told him I would not have the biopsy, for some reason when I left his office I felt somewhat elated. It was as if this new information was adventureous. Knowing the end might very well be not far off at all. Yet I was feeling absolutely healthy! 


"
"


							I think the biopsy was suggested to rule out liver cancer (hepatoma). Although tumor marker cannot be used for cancer diagnosis, but under certain circumstanced they can be helpful. Have you talk to your physician about an alpha fetoprotein test? 

Regards,

J. Jay Lu, MD
						

"
"


							If the test you refer to is the one I believe it is, yes all the tests the doctor requested in bloodwork over the past several years included the ""alpha protein"" one. 

At the time he discussed the results of the CT-Scan with me he mentioned it and said the results indicated I might have cancer but that it was not totally conclusive and the only way to know would be to have a liver biopsy.

Last week his temporary replacement placed much more confidence in the ""Alpha Protein"" test than my regular doctor and he said he believed the spots were cancerous.

I still feel very well comparitively speaking for my age and I see no reason to proceed any further with something like the biopsy, chemotherapy etc. and I am satisfied with just continuing my medication. 

My regular doctor said quote: ""That is a sane decision.""
						

"
"


							Dear Sir,

I am sorry to hear about these problems. It seems that you are doing well, though. 

On your question about what to expect if this is indeed cancer, there are so many things that can happen, such as infections, blood clots, liver failure and such. It is impossible to know how this will or will not go. Even if you choose not to have any treatment or biopsy, I encourage you to stay in touch with your physicians, as there are many things that can be done to make you comfortable, in case you have pain, shortness of breath, and such. Not having treatment does not mean not having ""care"". I strongly believe in palliative medicine, and if you made a decision about not treating or pursuing this, you are obviously entitled to treatments aimed at making you comfortable.

							I had a lumpectomy 3 years ago on April 9th with Chemo and radiation following. Last year I had another biopsy in the same breast (it turned out to be a hematoma in the site of the tumor) which abcessed and took 8 months to heal. The Doctor says I can now have reconstruction done and have visited a couple of different plastic surgeons. The first one said he could take a flap from my back but could not use any implants because of the radiation that I had. This is what my medical oncologist had told me also. The second surgeon I visited said that he would also take a flap from my back but he would also use an implant. Now I am really confused.  Which one is right?

							Hi Militarymom....the procedure you describe is called the lattissimus dorsi flap whereas muscle, skin and tissue are taken to create a new breast.

							Hi -- I am a very recently diagnosed BC patient and first time poster.  I saw your question about implants and radiation. I too may need radiation following chemo (oncologist appt next week to review pathology report and determinefinal treatment plan).  As I understand what I was told, implants MAY not be a reasonable alternative after radiation because the blood supply to the skin may be compromised from the radiation and in stretching the skin to fulfull a 'cup' size the skin may be too thin and split.  I have been told by another Dr. that implants would not be out of the question if I opted for a small implant - A or B cup only and therefore a minimum amount of stretching.  Don't know if this reasoning is accurate for your situation, but hope the information helps!  MB
						

"
"


							I had tissue expanders put in at the same time as my mastectomy.  I had chemo and radiation (28 sessions).  About 12 weeks after radiation, I had a silicone implant put in.  

I talked to my PS about this, because there were a number of posts on the Komen board where women with radiation in the future were told that they could not have tissue expanders/implants.

My doc told me the following:  He will only do tissue expander reconstruction BEFORE radiation.  That is, the expander goes in before the radiation, and it is fully expanded (all the fills) before radiation.  He overfills it, so that it will have plenty of room for afterwards.  He will not do the implant surgery until at least 12 weeks after radiation is complete. 

Radiation does toughen the muscles so that it is a bit less flexible than if you did not have radiation.  That means it does not stretch well.  But any stretch put into it before radiation is there to stay.  He says he gets really great results doing it this way.  He will NOT, however, do any tissue expander/implant reconstruction that starts on an irradiated breast.  You have the get the muscle stretched BEFORE the radiation.  He says he does not get good results putting the expander in AFTER radiation (ie, reconstruction starting after radiation), and he will not do that surgery.

I have been very lucky I think.  My skin is virtually unharmed by the radiation, and the muscles did extremely well, and are not too badly thickened or rigid.  Both the PS and my radiation oncologist say that my skin and muscle after radiation is just about the best they have seen.   Genetics, apparently, although I did moisturize like crazy.

After my implant surgery, it took a good 2-3 months for the swelling to go down - a combination of having 10 nodes removed, and the irradiated tissue retards the outflow of the swelling.  I am now 3+ months out, and the implant breast is looking better bit by bit, projecting more and losing the pancake look, but I have to massage it every day to guard against encapsulation, and to force the implant down so it'll project and have a bit of droop.   I thought I would be able to have the nipple put on and the other breast lifted for symmetry at 4 months, but at this point I think that that is optimistice.  However, it looks pretty darn good even now when I am naked, and in a bra, it's fabulous (I need a bra to give some symmetry).  

I have to tell you that I have healed incredibly well and quickly.  I have had no complications at all from my surgery.

I think that the problems you indicated, the skin splitting, and blood supply problems, would arise if you had the implant put in AFTER radiation, when the skin and muscles are less flexible.  I think that this is why your surgeon said that he could put in a small implant with the lat flap after radiation, because it would not need all that much stretch.  And if he is going to use the lats, they have been unaffected by the radiation, so it makes sense that he could put in an implant - although if that is true, I don't understand why it has to be small - maybe there is some tissue that was irradiated that stays and that's the limitation.  Oh, that is confusing, I'd ask for more info.

I also believe that my doc said that he would not do any flap reconstruction at any time, before or after radiation, for women having radiation, because the results were not good.  I would check that out.
						

"
"


							Dear Militarymom,

It is true that radiation will delay healing after a surgery, but I am not sure whether an implant can be used or not. I think you need opinion from plastic surgeons.
Sorry I cannot offer much help here.

Hi, it's me again with another question!

I talked to my regular family doc about what the oncologist told me about needing a hysterectomy or radiation to my ovaries or taking a pill every three months since I'm not post-menopausal.
She was pretty upset that the oncologist just ""overlooked"" that fact and didn't give me any info about it.
Then she said, I could probably have an oophorectomy -- which she said means having just my ovaries removed.
Has anybody out there done that?
She also advised against having radiation on my ovaries to stop estrogen production because she said she's seen some severe problems with that -- such as the bowels attaching to each other.
Anybody know anything about that?
Also, how do I contact one of the docs on this forum?
Advice, suggestions, help.... please!

							Hello

This is a difficult choice, but the final goal is to reduce circulating estrogen levels. You can suppress the estrogen production by removing the ovaries (oophorectomy) or by using medications. The first-line seems to be by using medications such as tamoxifen, but some people just can not tolerate it, and some may just opt to have the ovaries taken out. It is a personal and difficult choice.

							I'd like to hear the docs ideas on this too. At time of my dx several years ago I looked high and low to try to find a clinical trial for brachytherapy so that I could get access to it. I asked my onc about that, too. But it wasn't there at the time for me. I agree with you. I did the conventional rads treatments (left breast). The ONLY sensation my breast has is discomfort... Also, I ended up with ""fatty necrosis"" at the base of the breast, which is a very hard ridge of tissue that feels like a bone sticking out from the chest. I also have repeated bouts of costochondritis every time I have a chest x-ray or other rads that take a while to settle down again. I am NED, which counts of course, but I wish I could have found access to brachytherapy.

							Dear All:
First of all, mammosite brachytherapy is not the standard type of radiation to be used after surgery (lumpectomy or mastectomy).  Mammosite is a type of brachytherapy that use very localized radiation to treat the tumor bed. However, recent researches have shown that it may be used but it is still under study.  For your reference I have attached a link to a recently published article for the topic.

Acute complications of MammoSite brachytherapy: a single institution's initial clinical experience.

Harper JL, Jenrette JM, Vanek KN, Aguero EG, Gillanders WE.

Department of Radiation Oncology, Medical University of South Carolina, Charleston, SC 29425, USA. harper@radonc.musc.edu

PURPOSE: To report the acute complications incurred by the initial 37 patients who underwent accelerated partial breast irradiation with the MammoSite balloon breast brachytherapy applicator at the Medical University of South Carolina. METHODS AND MATERIALS: Between May 2002 and March 2003, 37 patients with ductal carcinoma in situ or invasive carcinoma had MammoSite brachytherapy catheters successfully place after lumpectomy by one of four surgeons and were deemed eligible for high-dose-rate brachytherapy. An open technique was used in 32 implants and the scar entry technique was used in 5 implants. Patients had Stage pTis-pT2N1 with negative margins. A dose of 34 Gy was prescribed to 1 cm from the balloon surface using (192)Ir high-dose-rate brachytherapy and was delivered in 10 fractions twice daily. CT was used to confirm that the balloon surface was adherent to the lumpectomy cavity and to measure the balloon surface to skin surface distance. CT images and daily fluoroscopic simulations were used for treatment planning. Patients were assessed for acute toxicity on the day of therapy completion and 4 weeks after therapy by the radiation oncologist. In addition, all available data from radiation, surgical, and medical oncology were retrospectively reviewed for documentation of complications. All patients in this series had a minimal follow-up of 3 months; the mean follow-up for all patients was 7 months. RESULTS: The acute complications were categorized as operative wound complications, infections, skin toxicity, seromas, or catheter failures. Operative wound complications occurred in 3 patients (8%). Radiation Therapy Oncology Group Grade 2 and Grade 3 toxicity occurred in 2 (5.4%) and 1 (2.7%) patient, respectively. Six (16.2%) developed wound infections and 12 (32.4%) seromas. Catheter failures due to leak occurred in 2 patients (5.4%) and rupture in 3 (8%). CONCLUSION: The types of complications in this experience were similar to those in the Phase I trial of the MammoSite brachytherapy applicator. However, catheter failure due to leak occurred in our experience and was not described in the Phase I trial. The incidence of complications was greater in our series than in the Phase I trial; however, differences in toxicity scoring and the length of follow-up between the two series impeded direct comparisons. The incidences of complications over time reflect the steep learning curve for accelerated partial breast irradiation using the MammoSite brachytherapy applicator. Finally, radiation recall dermatitis developed in 1 patient treated after this review was completed.

All my doctors have been treating me with kid gloves because I was diagnosed while pregnant and recently miscarriaged.

							Hi Fiddle, glad you found us. So sorry about your miscarriage. That is so sad. I cannt answer your question as I was a Stage I gal, but we have people here at all ages and stages, so I am sure someone will respond to you about their experiences. Hugs, Lauri

							I am very sorry about your diagnosis and recent experience. 

The staging book (AJCC2002) probably has the best data, but they are not really updated since better chemotherapy agents were discovered after the collection of the data, and radiation after mastectomy became standard now.
You may consider talking to your physician about one of the resent large scale phase III study and ask about the survival data for the subgroup of patients that had your stage.  

Unfortunately I am not able to give you a reference for your question since I believe your physician has the best information regarding to your condition, especially the stage, grade, and age.

Hope you can talk to your oncologist soon and get the detailed information about your diagnosis and the prognosis outlook.

							Hi Fiddle,

I'm a stage III.  Sunday will be my 2 yr anniversary from dx.  I am doing fine.  I had one positive node, a very large tumor and am HER2+ so I entered a clinical trial to get herceptin.  I believe I did all I could to aggressively rid myself of the cancer.  Statistics are just a guide.  I hear all the time about stage 1 or 2 patients that recurr 6 months after treatment ends.  Why haven't I?????  I haven't a clue.  And I'm not about to look a gift horse in the mouth!  Good luck to you.

							Hi All,
My story is much like Greg's but I am passed the PSV treatment and now, after my seizures are not responding much to 1800mg of Tegretol and 600mg of Topomax a day, my doctor is suggesting radiotherapy.

My problem with the treatment is that, although the MRI does not show serious growth, I am so fed up with the seizures, (Partial complex - right side), that I am weighing the treatment against my mindset and the long term possible damage as a result of the seizures, which no one has been able to define what they are yet. (Perhaps someone can put some light on that subject).

Does anyone have any experience with radiotherapy and can anyone tell me what sort of a ride to expect. (I know it differs for each person, but some clue would be helpful.)

Any other words of wisdom would be welcome.

Thank you.

David Singer.

							Although the dose of radiation could be different but they are similar.  Usually patients receive localized radiation and whole brain radiation is not commonly used for this condition. 

Common side effects include alopecia, fatigue, skin reaction, dizziness, headache, nausea and (less likely) vomiting.  Decrease blood count may also happen but not common. Severe side effects are uncommon although can happen. 

Your physician should have explained to you about the complications and side effects in details already. If he/she has not done that, please set up another time for more information. 

Hope you will not experience any side effects I mentioned here.

							I have a collegue 57 years old with stage 4 endometrial cancer. The cancer has spread to her lungs. My question however concerns itching that she has had for almost a year now. There is no visible rash. The itch is all over her body (feet, hands, arms, legs, trunk, face, etc) She has been to numerous doctors of all sorts (internist, dermatologist, neurologist, oncologist, herbologist, enocrinologsit, psychiatrist) to no avail. Noone seems to know the source of her itching or can tell her definively if it is caused by her cancer. She has tried many remedies both topical and medicnal. Nothing has helped thus far. Does anyone have any insight?????????

							From painful experience, one potential cause of terrible itching is high biliruben, which is a common byproduct of the liver if the bile system gets backed up.  In my case, they found a tumor in my common bile duct, which stopped up the outflow of bile, causing the liver to put out vast quantities of biliruben.  Besides the vile itching, the other obvious side effect was jaundice - i.e. first the whites of the eyes, and then the skin turned yellow, over a period of several weeks.

This is not by any means the only potential cause, but it is easily detected by normal blood tests.

							I had the same type of severe itching that you are describing.  It was an uncontrollable itch.  After multiple trips to the doctor I was diagnosed with stage 3-B Hodgkins disease (Cancer of the lymphnodes).  I was told that the severe itching was caused by abnormalities with the lymphnodes.  Out of all of the drugs they gave me to try to control the itch, the only one that even came close to offering some relief was ativan.

							While she was in the hospital, the pain medicine my aunt was taking was making her itch like that and at first we thought it had something to do w/the cancer, but soon after that, they switched her pain meds and the itching went away.  I'm not sure if that is it or not, but it sounds like it might be an allergic reation.  (also, just so you know, there was no rash or anything either, her sking just itched her.)

							All went well with my left simple mastectomy on 1/14 and on 2/7 was scheduled for my port.  The previous week I noticed several symptoms, although did not feel sick, just wasn't 'myself'.  First a low grade fever for 3 nights and ONLY at night <101..loss of appetite and an odd feeling in the pit of my stomach that I thought at the time was nerves.  But truthfully, couldn't figure why I was so nervous about the port when I had less anxiety going thru a mastectomy!  Anyway, then I started to notice that my urine was extremely dark and concentrated and my stool was very light, almost gray.  I didn't feel truly sick but mentioned it to my dr. before the surgery and he noted that my skin was yellow.  I was jaundiced!  Port cancelled and spent 3 days in the hospital with full testing of liver, pancreas, gall bladder etc.  CT scans, MRIs and neuclear type testing too.  All thank God were negative for cancer, blocked bile ducts, etc  and all looked OK.  My oncologist visting bedside said that the jaundice could be due to the general anesthesia given me during mastectomy and that my liver had difficutly processing it.  Uncommon but it happens.  The gastro Dr. concurred and said he's seen it although it happens to about 1 out of 1,000 pts (lucky me)   I was told that if that was the case, my billirubin level would peak, and then start to come down which is exactly what it did.  I went from 5.6 to 3.4 inside a week and a week later was down to normal at .6....I do not like process of elimination when determining my health  but it seems they could have been right on.  I had no treatment or meds, so I would think if I had a liver disease or something else going on my levels would not have been back to normal. Since this seems to be an uncommon occurrance, have the Drs seen this type of medical issue or heard of it before? And, what in heaven's name will chemo do to my liver if it couldn't handle general anesthesia?   Thanks in advance!  MB

							Dear MB,
Thanks for using the Cancer Forums.
Personally I am not familiar with the anesthesia procedure used in general surgical procedures. My only experience was 3 days training in my 4th year medical school for that field, although I thought about that residency for my career.   
I don't know if Dr. Leo will have the knowledge, but I think you can always ask your surgeon to refer you to the anesthesilogist for a consultation.

Hi.  I am only at the beginning of the road.  I just had a hysterectomy for fibroids.  (They took cervix, ovaries and tubes as a preventative measure)  The post surgical biopsy showed a uetrine sarcoma.  This was sent to John Hopkins for a second opinion.  I am still awating results. I am sorry that I do not have much to offer except I am 45 and am looking for the same information you are.  I know  my doctors will be a great source of information once we get further along, but I am starved for resorces now.  It does not seem as thought there is a tremendous amount of information out there regarding uterine cancer, specifically a sarcoma.  Good luck to you and I will share whatever I come across.

							My sister was diagnosed with papilary serous adenocarcinoma uterine cancer that had advanced to stage 4 by time of diagnosis.  The cancer had spread outside the uterus and was found from the diaphram to the rectum at time of debulking surgery.  She had a complete hyst including removal of ovaries.  There were 2 positive lymphs in the groin and cancer cells that were left behind on the diaphram after surgery.  10 days post op she had considerable build up of cancerous ascities in the peritenial cavity as well. (forgive my poor spelling!)  She immediately began 6 rounds of carboplatin/pacitaxel combination chemotherapy.  Her CA125 level at time of surgery was 1480 (normal is considered 30 or lower).  She had a 100% response to chemo and was declared in remission in January of this year.  She has since had 3 clean cat scans and her CA 125 level remains around 5-7.  Stage 4 cancer of this type is very deadly but remember, someone, somewhere, has been cured of every type and stage of cancer there is!!  There's no reason to believe that it can't be you!!!

							Hello all,

I am in a little bit of a dilemna.  I recently had a mole removed on the right side neck near my collar bone area.  I just received a phone call from my doctor telling me that it is just a superficial skin cancer and that he got it all.  I have had 3 other moles removed over the last 4 years and they were all okay.  The day after I had the mole removed (just 1 1/2 weeks ago) I began getting what looked like a rash.  Within 2 days what I thought was a rash turned into little liquid-filled bumps and they were all over my hands, arms, and a few on my chest and back, but promarily on the left side of my body.  I immediately called the doctor went back in to see him.  He told me that it was a ""viral explosion.""  I do not know what to believe.  They are now starting to ""dry"" out, but the redness and bumpiness is still there.  They ITCH like crazy from the moment that they showed up until now.  Are they really just a ""viral explosion"" or are they related to the skin cancer?

							Hello

I am not sure what he meant by a ""viral explosion"", but it can be for example an allergic reaction to something he might have used during the procedure, even the cleaning solutions and drapes.... but it can also be a viral infection, though I would think it has nothing to do with the skin cancer.

Thanks for posting. Small cell lung cancer is unfortunately a very difficult one to treat. I am sorry to say that the prognosis is not good.

							Hi Meredith,

My mom has small cell lung cancer and it has spread to different parts of her body.  We weren't given an exact prognosis but the doctor has only given us ""weeks.""  I am sorry to hear about your aunt but from the research that I have done personally as well as my personal experiences, small cell lung cancer is very hard to beat if at all.  The likelihood of small cell lung cancer spreading to the brain is very high and we had to do a radiation treatment to her head as a preventative treatment back in her early stage.  She is now in a later more advanced stage and it has spread to her liver, abdomen and bone.  Right now, your aunt needs you to be there for her.  She is going through a lot right now.  Some things to be watchful of is her attitude and moods.  My mom is very moody (result of pain and constant fatigue).  The best thing you can do for her and yourself is to spend some time with her.  Good luck.

							I went online and ordered a few more books to prepare myself for the road ahead. I'm still eagerly awaiting Breast Cancer for Dummies.

I also picked Just Get Me Through This! because it sounded like it would also be a good practical guide. What the description and the book cover did not indicate was that it's only for Stage I and II breast cancer women. Though after I start reading it, the author claims that if this book was recommended to me that I must be a woman with early cancer (I & II). Won't the treatment of a Stage III patient be similiar as far as chemo, surgery and radiation? 

I've only read the first 27 pages but I don't like that she keeps wanting to put Stage I & II people in  an entirely different category from Stage III and IV, as if they are the people with cancer and we are the ""cancer patients that will eventually die from the disease.""

							Hi there,

I have real problem with categorizing people during cancer treatment.  I think the treatment is similar regardless of staging although those at earlier stages may not undergo chemo and radiation.  I know of people who are stage 3 and 4 who are years out from diagnosis...just as I know people who were stage 1, got treatment, then later had reoccurances and are now stage 4.  Don't think because you are stage 3 that you are automatically worse off than anyone else.  Also, some people will say that you are worse off with node involvement.  I don't think people should make generalities.  If anything, I think that stage 3 and 4 people and those with node involvement generally opt for more aggressive treatments.  Each case is different.  I know there are those here who will disagree with me but that's my take on it.

							In regard to Just Get Me Through It, I agree with you FiddleDeDe. The book has some practical recommendations, but its focus is pretty myopic as it is written from the viewpoint of treatment for someone who is stage I or II and doesn't really think beyond that.

I found that tuning in to many of the telephone conferences and online discussions offered by Cancercare was worth the time, regardless of stage. 

I used Dr. Love's books (including her menopause and hormone book); Dr. Link's books; Living Beyond Breast Cancer, by Marisa Wiess, and many, many textbooks.

							Dear FiddleDeDe,

It is not true that patients with stage III or IV are ?cancer patients that will eventually die from the disease,?  but the treatment is a little different.  More patients with stage I and II disease can have lumpectomy and avoid chemotherapy compare to stage III patients. Physicians may describe diseases beyond stage I and II ?locally advanced breast cancer? although the majority will survive the disease and treatment.

However, on the last one yesterday it was 2.7 -- a big drop in only a few weeks.  My radiologist doesn't seem to be concerned although she is going to talk to my onc about it.  I know that chemo and radiation can do this even after chemo has stopped, and I know there are shots available to boost the WBC back up but was wondering if anyone knows of anything that I can do to get the WBC back up without taking the shot?  folic acid, iron?

I would talk to the oncologist and see what he/she advises.  I've heard of ladies eating extra meat to bring their RBC count up, but have no idea what to do for the WBC.

Good luck and  hugs,

							Thanks, ladies.  I had the Neulasta shot during chemo and am not fond of it -- it burns as it goes into the body and is quite uncomfortable for a while but if that's what it takes I will do it.  was just hoping for an alternative.

							Hi, I've been lurking to see what other answers might surface here, and now I am wondering whether your WBC is climbing yet at all? 

I don't know how useful this information is, but my WBC also rose after treatment and then fell again (although not as much as yours).  One thing I really appreciate is that my docs pay attention and continue to follow the counts WITH me. That gives me confidence that whatever is happening they are doing their best with me. My onc is also a hematologist and after a recent CBC done around Christmas-time he took the time to call and left a brief message acknowledging the length of time I have been out of treatment (2 years) but also indicating that he expects them to rise. I believe him.

One alternative source suggested using thymus extract as a possibility. I actually did buy some but have not taken it as it is bovine and from another country and I just couldn't get past the notion of mad cow disease....  I chose instead to go for doing what I can to bring about better bone health in general -- anaylzing what to eat and what not to, plus getting the natural sunshine for vitamin D, getting enough calcium and magnesium and vitamin C to build bone, plus adding in some weightbearing exercise. 

My counts in general have improved, for whatever that is worth. 

Best wishes,

A.A.

							Thanks for the suggestions and encouragement.  My radiologist has spoken with my onc and I have an appointment on Wednesday to take WBC again and then determine what is the best thing to do before starting chemo in two weeks.  I have a feeling they will suggest a Neulasta shot which kept my WBC up during my last chemo treatments.  In the meantime, I'm eating all the right things, taking vitamins and supplements, and exercising to put more oxygen into the bloodstream hoping this will all help the blood cells rejuvinate themselves.  Its atleast helped my hair to start growing back very quickly....fuzzy like goose down    Too bad it will probably fall out again when I start these last 4 treatments....oh well.

							Dear Marion,

I don?t know much about that supplement either.  Usually if the WBC count is around 3 and the composition of it is also within normal range, physicians will not start treatment to boost the count. 

You are right, the WBC may drop shortly after the treatment, and you must be careful about any symptoms, especially related to anemia and infection. Please contact your oncologist as soon as possible if you have new symptoms, and make sure you follow-up with them on time.

Although the chance is not big, you cannot be too careful. 

Good luck,

							Hi,

I've been taking the Neulasta the day after my chemo and my white blood count has remained great.  The onco has been pleased.  The shot is not bad at all...just a little sting.

							Hi Marion,
I was interested in your question about WBC and decided to join the forum to share some info.
Two years ago, I finished 35 rads and boost and then, also, began a gradual drop in WBC below normal range as you did. I made an exhaustive search for complementary treatments and found several supplement protocols that worked for me. My WBC climbed back up over 4 which helped convince me of the value of trying the alternative path first, if possible.

Alkylglycerols- increases white blood cell production. Contains compounds found in shark liver oil (This is not shark cartilage!) ImmunoFin is the brand I used, made by Lane Labs... sold by Vitamin Shoppe and others (can be found on the Internet)
Also, check out taurine, AHCC, cat's claw and grapeseed extract. I take all of these from time to time to keep the count in the normal range.
There is also Polyerga, a purified extract of peptides made from the spleen of pigs (sounds dreadful, I know) but it is actually a benign, little white pill. At the moment I have forgotten the distributor's name but it can be obtained on the Internet . It is recommended for suppressed WBC by the authors of How to Treat Cancer with Natural Medicine by Drs. Murray, Birdsall et al.
Hope this is a bit helpful.

							Hi There,

I have had a swollend gland in the right side of my neck for about 2.5 weeks now.  It comes and goes.  My throat is not sore, and I feel great otherwise.  Is this cause for concern?  My Doctor just put me on antibiotics.  I am really freaked out though.  Any response would be greatly appreciated.

							Dear Jennifer,

There are many causes of this symptom. Of course lymphoma is one of the cause (and I know that is what you are worrying about because you post a message here), but infection is probably more common than lymphoma for an enlarged neck node, and one has to think about other types of cancer too if malignancy is what we worry about the most.

If your condition does not improve after antibiotics treatment, you should talk to your physician again.  A biopsy of the node may be needed to rule out malignancy.

							I recently had a shave biopsy done on a mole. The report came back benign. 

Because the entire thing wasn't removed, it's possible the lesion will return though. 

My question is: I feel if the mole had been left alone, it may have been benign for many many years and never turned atypical or malignant. But now I feel as though because the mole has been shaved, it will somehow disrupt the cells, forcing them to turn atypical as it grows back and ultimately trigger malignancy. 

Is this even possible?

							This is perhaps a terrible question for such a serious problem, but this is the only place I can ask it. A relative of mine, a 22 year old female, claimed to have been diagnosed with melanoma in October, and the series of claims that have taken place since have led all her relatives to doubt her (as the claims and actions do not coincide with our own experiences with cancer).

The first instance of doubt came when she claimed the biopsy wouldn't be known whether it was cancerouse for two weeks. Other friends who've had cancers have had their biopsies back in 24 hours. Is she possibly right? 

She claimed to have gotten a ""green card"" allowing her to have medical marijuana to alleviate her nausea, yet after researching the net, I find that only 8 people have medical marijuana legally. We are a state where it is illegal--would a doctor risk his job for this?

The doctors, she claimed, didn't want to do surgery on the ""baseball"" sized tumor located below the skin, because they were afraid that when the tumor cells ""hit air"" they would metastasize and spread through the body, so they have given her radiation and chemo for the last 4 and a half months. She has had daily chemo for several weeks, supposedly, and in the meantime also flown to LA, Phoenix, Salt Lake and boise, in addition to taking care of a two year old, going to college, and running her own business. In this time, she has not visited home nor been visited by family. Can someone be so superhuman as to be able to do all this without help? Those I know who've had chemo would not have been able to.

It is terrible to doubt a person who would have such a dreadful disease, but doubt we all do as no one has seen her or a bill. Are we being terribly cold and indifferent or are we being duped?

							Hi my husband and I had a similar situation about 30- yrs ago with a friend my husband got involved with in a new business - guess he couldn't cut it and told us he had cancer and went off to live in Ireland. We knew nothing about cancer in those days, but it turned out it was a cop out. Sometimes I guess people can't deal with the realities of life and they ""invent"" cancer as a way of opting out of their responsibilities. Just be aware, as you are. I have breast cancer, and it is real and in no way a cop out, just wish I didn't have it. Take care - get some real proof, then if it is real, help her.

							lol, no one has any thoughts on my question? But Ralph, I wanted to respond to you. =)

It actually is quite possible that the results could take two weeks. It really depends on the lab and the office she went to. Usually though, if cancer is detected, I would think one would get a call ASAP.

The thing about not wanting to do surgery on the baseball (that sounds huge) lump because of fear of metastasis - do you mean they did not even remove the lump?

The thing about exposure to air spreading cancer, as far as I know, has been an old wives tale. I'd be surprised if any doctors worked with that theory in mind anymore.

Also, are you positive she's still being so active?

Now, I can't say myself what her real deal is, but thought with this info, maybe you could add that to the conclusion you draw.

							Hello Feardalgo,

Shaving the mole won't change it to be more likely to get malignant. Still, if not everything was taken out, you can always go back and ask the physicians to remove the rest of it.

							Hi, Leo! Thanks for the response. That is what I thought. Can I ask where you got that info though? Has this been proven?

I had heard of people having benign moles shaved, but they later grew back as melanoma. So - it is possible, I guess? But the chances are NOT increased because of a shave biopsy, right? That's what I'm concerned about.

							I posted a story about my mom that has some interesting information that may help.  She is now 83 and has been undergoing treatments and living with panceatic cancer for 19 months now.  I just wrote her story under Angel's Wings, it turned out to be long but it's her story from the beginning and all the treatments she's gotten.  You can never be edcuated enough especially when someone you love has a terrible disease!  I don't think they would do a pancreatic transplant although your intentions are good.  There is a whipple procedure that is sometimes done but is complicated and can be fatal.  A friend of mine's father had one done and died a short time later of complications.  There are other alternatives out there such as radation and chemptheraphy that can help.  This is not a disease that ever goes away, it is only controled to prolong life.  Most people only live 3 to 6 months and don't even know they have it until it's too late.  We were lucky my mother got symptoms early on, it's too bad that 2 doctors did not properly diagnose it.  Thank God we still were able to get her help that has helped this long.  She's going through a tough time right now but is starting on Tarceva tomorrow then there is Camposar left.  Hopefully they will come out with more drugs soon to keep people living longer.  Get a good oncologist who you trust and knows what they are doing and you should get good results.  I thank God my mother has....she's a walking miracle!   Good luck with your dad!

							Hi All,

I'm hoping that someone might have some extra information for me from experience.  My father had a CT scan and the doctors identified two areas that they believe are cancerous growths (liver and colon).  They are having him come in for an operation.  I know time is a factor with cancer so I don't want to delay, but this seems like a very sloppy diagnosis.  With the colon aren't they suppose to do a scope to get a sample?  Is there something similar that should be done with the liver too?  

I'm trying to get more information from my parents, but they haven't asked the doctors any questions.  I'm trying desperately to get involved but they aren't giving me any information and the doctor refuses to hand-out medical information!!!  It's like they don't even care!!!!!!!!!!!!  Sorry, had to vent.

In truth I don't trust the doctor and I want a second opinion for my father.  Could someone give me a head-start into the types of things I should be asking, terms I should be using, and more cancer information or places to gather it from?  I would really, really appreciate any help.  How would I know the severity - I've heard of malignant and benign cancer, should I be asking what type it is?

Regards,

Mike
						

"
"


							Generally waiting a few weeks in order to get a second opinion shouldn't cause any difference in the outcome. Can you ask his doctor how long he can safely delay the surgery?

You can Google search websites under, ""second opinion cancer"" and there are lots of suggestions on how to do this.  Do you live near your parents? Asking friends is a good place to start for doctor referrals. The doctor in question should be willing to give some names for reputable surgeons for second opinions. A primary care physician should be able to generate a list of names and perhaps some information about those surgeons. 

I read Susan Love's Breast Book before talking to a surgeon. Though my questions are different than a man with liver and colon, but a quick thumb through a book at a library or book store should yield some good questions. 

In my opinion, a good doctor will look you straight in the eye and answer all questions thouroughly in lay man's terms. Most doctors will allow you to bring a tape recorder if you ask nicely. Because the information may be overwhelming it's good to have a record to check back on.  

If all else fails, if your father has a good relationship with his primary care physician, perhaps a family meeting with this doctor will help you get a game plan together.

Best of luck to you.

							Hi Mike,
sorry to hear about your father's illness. At the very least he needs to have biopsies (samples) taken from the colon and liver. This is done by a colonoscopy for the large colon and endoscopy if it is the small intestine.
A liver biopsy is done separately - neither procedures are without risks of perforation. The biopsy tissue is then lookd at by a pathologist who can determine what type of cancer it is. 
I had breast cancer 2 years ago and was not at all happy with the Oncologist I was referred to by my breast surgeon. After two consultations, during which he was very rude, patronising and refused to answer my questions, I refused to see him and told a nurse in the Oncology suite. I was instantly transferred to a young female Oncologist who treated me with respect and was wonderful. I live in England so have socialised medicine as you do in Canada, but believe you have the right to see a doctor of your own choosing, within your area. Is there a social worker at the hospital whom you could contact to sort this out for you?
Perhaps your father wll allow you to go with him to his next appointment so you can talk to the doctor yourself. I would call his primary care physician and explain the situation, since if the system is the same as it is in the UK, it is he/she who can do the referrals.
Good luck, Liz.

							Thank you so much Liz and LA girl, 

I've communicated a few things through my mother to the doctor, but my parents are afraid to know any details about the process, so I will have to retrieve it on my own.  They've indicated to the doctor that I will be calling with a few questions so I am feeling positive about that.  Thank you for the questions, I will be asking them.

The doctor stated he can do a biopsy, but a CT is 90% accurate so it is not needed.  I've recommended my parents to have it, so they will do so.  I'm nervous that I've started recommending medical advice to them, but from what I have read it is a necessary step.

My parents live a couple hours from me so it is a little drive,  but I don't mind making it.  I'm a little nervous that it is an out-of-the city hospital - not to say country hospitals are worse, just not funded as well as city ones.

I have more information on the type of cancer:  It is in the Liver, about 5cm large and there is another growth just below the liver but not quite to the colon - so he won't have to suffer the colonoscopy.  They will not have the surgery 'until the summer because they are all booked up, but if they have an opening they will insert him.' <- I really don't like the sound of that.  

They are going to remove the gall bladder even though it hasn't spread there - I have no idea why, I'll have to research.

							Note on the CT, if you haven't had one before. Your dad will need to sit by himself for about an hour for the test because they will inject him with radioactive material. It sounds scary but the benefits far outweigh the risks here. Of all the tests I did I found this hard because my spouse could be with me prior to and during most of the other scans, but not this.

Just wanted to warn you so that he can try and bring a really distracting book or music with him. I felt like I had too much time alone to worry about what they would find, unlike the bone scan, MRI, etc. when I could have someone with me.
						

"
"


							Hello

Thanks for posting. Sometimes the diagnosis of cancer is difficult, but the CT can define how likely it is for a finding to be malignant. If it has a good chance of being malignant, sometimes doctors choose to have the whole area taken out. There is also likely that they send a piece of the are to the pathologist during the surgery (called a frozen section), so that instantly they can decide whether it is cancerous or not. While this technique is not 100% precise, it will support or not the diagnosis, and help with immediate planning.

I have a male friend 76 yrs old, who was dx with non-small cell lung cancer 5 yrs ago and had his right lung removed. A year later the cancer had spread to his left kidney and adrenal gland, upon which he transferred hospitals and went to the Moffitt Cancer Centre in Tampa, Florida. He had excellent treatment at the Moffitt, followed by one month in a rehab facility. He is now completely clear of cancer and looks about 60 yrs old.
The Moffitt is associated with the University of South Florida and has an excellent reputation for treating all kinds of cancer. I don't know where you live in the US, but I do recollect meeting a number of patients who had travelled to Florida for treatment, from Texas, Arizona etc. because they were advised locally that the best doctors for them were at Moffitt.
Moffitt have a website that may give you further information.

							heelo. my name is jamie. i am writing to you about my boyfriend rick, who i have been with for over 3 years. ill try to make this short. 1 and 1/2 months ago, we noticed two lumps on his neck. after a couple of weeks, i got him to go to the doc. he said they were swollen lymph nodes, and did a few tests, including mono, it came back neg. they said wait 2 more weeks, and if they dont go down, come back. 2 weeks pass, and we are going to go to the doctor, but one night i noticed another lump on his other side, just below his jaw. by the next day, it was HUGE. so big it was causing him alot of pain and anxiety. so we went to the ER. they did a test for mono. it came back POSITIVE. they also did a scan of his chest and found 2 swollen lymph nodes. the doc was concerned that he didnt have any other symptoms of mono, so he did another test to be sure it was. we found out today it was NOT. so they are sending him to a surgeon to see what he wants to do. i am terrified. he has always been very healthy, and he does not have any symptoms of nhl, or hl, such as night sweats, or fever. nothing. so i have  a few questions.  1) does it sound like cancer?
2) the nodes swelled up really fast, so wouldnt he display more symptoms if in fact it was a rapid cancer?  3) the node that prompted us to go to the ER went down considerably in size, wouldnt cancer just make them stay the same or get bigger? i know i am grasping at straws here, but he is everything to me, and it is breaking my heart to thin he could have cancer. i am so scared, as is he. please, everyone who reads this, ANY advice would be wonderful.... thank you.

							I know you are scared but it sounds like both you and the doctor are on top of things. There is no way to know whether or not he has a cancer without a biopsy. It is true that in the early stages of some lymphomas that there are few if any symptoms, which can be a blessing of sorts. Just know that in most cases, this is now a very treatable cancer if it is one, and if not the doctors will also know how to handle whatever it is. Take care.

Sorry to hear about this experience. It sounds like he needs a definite diagnosis, and it can only be reached by removing one of these nodes and sending to a pathologist.

							Ladies, it does take a few weeks to get used to the port.  I have had mine now for 6 years.  and sometime it is uncomfortable if i sleep on it the wrong way etc.  However the port is a godsend especially if you dislike IV's as much as I do.  I also have crohns disease and use my port for testing in lots of areas.  If you take good care of your port it will be of a great help for a long time.  Make sure that you get it flushed when you are not using it and make sure that you only use nurses that can get it accessed easily.  Last tip... EMLA cream... put this on about one hour befrore they access it, then put saran wrap, that new stick one is perfect!  Do this and there is no pain what so ever even when they access it... good luck with your port and your chemo, this will make this whole process so much easier!
HUGS!

							I had a bitch of a time with mine. The good news is that it did not get infected. The surgical nurse I spoke with a week after it was put in suggested that because the surgeon found a vein and then lost it for awhile, he may have had to do some extra poking around, causing extra bruising.

This is what I was instructed to do. When they say use the arm as normal, they REALLY mean it. If it's too stiff or sore, get a moist electric heating pad from a medical supply store. Rest your upper arm off the arm of a couch or something so that the elbow lower arm are not resting on anything. Keep the moist heat on for 10 -20 minutes while you stretch the arm. Adding a hammer or 1 - 2 pound weight to the arm can help stretch it. Bend it every few minutes then resume the stretch. I know this is safe from physical therapy for the other arm that was broken last spring.

Even if the arm hurts use it to carry groceries and other things. The more you baby the arm, the stiffer it will get. Also do NOT follow the advice of one of my NPs: taking ibuprofen for the swelling. My stomach was mess for days after that. Tylenol and the heating pad are the way to go in this case.

Good luck

							hi - I am definitely getting used to the port.  I did continue to use my arm and I now have more range of motion.  It still gets in the way sometimes but much less soreness. A lot of it was also due to the incision which is now healing well.  Tuesday starts chemo.  I'm nervous but trying to be confidient that the meds they will give me that day (plus the Kyrtril and comapazine that have been perscribed) will manage the naseau. Keeping my fingers crossed!

This is how I feel when I get seasick without the naseau (ok I'm staring to get just a little queasy but will take my med shortly). Will see how the next few days go.  since I seem to be ""OK"" in the last 16 hrs is that an indication this is how it will be or can it still get really bad?  MB

							Hello all (and especially the Drs);

Cathy is finished her chemo (6xFEC100) as of last Friday and we are off next week to a cottage for a rest. During chemo, she was told not to drink alcohol as her liver was already busy processing the chemo chemicals. The doctors did give the OK for one glass of wine or beer (no hard stuff) in between the chemos. She enjoyed this after her fatigue began to lift, usually at the end of the 2nd week.

Since chemo is over, when can this restriction be lifted? When she asked the onc she told him that she had a glass of wine every three weeks, so he automatically said ""then in 3 weeks.""

Would it be OK to resume light drinking (i.e. wine with dinner or wine and cheese) at the cottage after chemo has been done for 10 days?

Thanks,

							All of the literature I have seen posted on the use of alcohol and cancer, was related to 'more than' moderate use.  (I do have articles on this, if you desire I will share with you.)  
I was told by my oncologist that a glass of wine every other day or so, would not be harmful.
I guess that makes me as big of a 'lush' as you LOL

							Hi i am 20 yrs old and i was dignosed with melanoma about 3  or 4 months ago , they said it wasnt a bad case  but it still worries me. i use to get in the tanning bed alot and i havent since i was told i had gotten  it,  people i have talked to that have had melanoma and had it rmoved told me that they have gotten in the tanning bed since then and it hasnt came back and they are fine, what is the chance of reacurrance and would getting in the tanning bed be a bad idea?

If your light skinned, deal with it, if people make fun of you tel them , at least I aint cooking myself. Id give 100 bucks to have my light fair complected skin back again. Man youre just asking for it if you keep going back into one of those things.

							Danielle,

These tanning beds can certainly increase the chances of anyone developing skin cancer. For someone that has the diagnosis of melanoma it should be off the table. There are other alternatives like these spray-type of tanning salons. I really don't know much about that, but please do not use these tanning beds

							My fiance used the spray on tanning and it looked actually kind of real, it doesnt look like that rub on stuff that you can buy at lets say wal mart and doesnt streak or any of that stuff,much much safer than the beds. I agree with Leo. Youd have to be nuts though to jump back into one of those after you were told you had melanoma, why not jump into a microwave, think of it that way. you are cooking yourself more or less. that stuff is even worse for you than the sun itself id think, the rays or light is right on top of your body.  i think i tanned in a boothonce or twice and it got me so hat i said heck with that, ill stay white thanks lol, if people wanna make fun of ya for being light complected tell em hey least i ain baking myself.
						

"
"


							The salon you go to should make you fill out a health questionairre. It will ask about skin cancer/melanoma. If you are honest on that they won't even let you in the beds. Please don't. It's so not worth it.
						

"
"


							If you developed skin cancer at only 20, your chances of reoccurance are probably high enough even if you never go into a tanning bed again.  So, for the sake of your health, stay out of the tanning salon and keep an eye on your skin!  

But that aside, isn't tanning about trying to look good?  Well, you can choose to be sexy and tan now, but you'll pay for it by being extra wrinkly later...   

So for the sake of your appearance and your health, once again, stay out!!

							Hi
I was going to respond, but realized I don't know some of your vital statistics (not meausrements , but initial diagnosis, and when; pre or post menopausal, grade of tumor, size of tumor, responsiveness to hormones or her-2/neu?   
An easy way to always include that in your questions or comments would be to post that information in your profile.   Then, when you sign your name, it will magically appear.
How fast does cancer grow?   Well, it doubles in size every (blank) days.    To fill in the blank, would need to know some of the above info.

							Roxi1:
The speed of the growth depends on the differentiation, and different tumor has very diff growth rate. If the biopsy was negative for any cancer or precancerous disease, the physician will tell you that is a negative biopsy and indicates no cancer. You should discuss with your physician more if you are in doubt. Please do not keep it with yourself only, physicians are there to help you and answer your questions.

You are doing the right thing by having the lump you found checked out, but like Laurie said, many lumps turn out to be something other than cancer.

							Hello

Thanks to you all for posting. There are excellent chances of this not being cancerous. In young women nodules may represent fibroadenomas, which are benign nodules that do not have anything to do with cancer, and they do not progress to cancer. Other causes include trauma, after which you get a ""scar tissue"" sort of nodule, and that resolves with time. 

Best of luck

							Hi,
Okay..double mastectomy 12 months ago.  Diagnosis: Hi grade DCIS, comedo type, 2.7cm.  No sentinel node done because this was only to be a prophylactic measure.  Of course, no adjuvunct therapy.  Now I have a VERY tender spot on my rib cage just below the reconstructed left breast.  I noticed this because my bra was rubbing against it. I can't feel a lump (I think) Just a really sore spot about the size of a dime on my rib? Sore for about 2 weeks.

No clue as to what to look for as it relates to mets.  I realize that DCIS should not spread, but I guess I am in the paranoid camp.

You wouldn't be the first to join the paranoid camp!!   I can remember feeling the same way about a pain in my arm.  I had just been diagnosed with BC.   I was not convinced it wasn't bone mets until I had a bone scan.  Anyway, it turned out to be nothing and hopefully yours will turn out that way as well.  It's funny how now every little ache and pain takes on so much more significance in my mind.  I hope one day I won't worry so much but for now I guess I'm a charter member of the Paranoid Club.

							Hi, Lane, and welcome. I'm another member of that Paranoid Club. I think all BC survivors are awarded special membership when they are diagnosed. I guess for peace of mind, I would call my doctor and ask about the pain. She what he/she thinks. Perhaps a chest x ray is in order to rule out anything serious. Good luck. Please keep us posted on what you find out. And, feel free to jump into any of the discussions here. Hugs, Lauri

"


							I, too, am a member of the paranoid club LOL....however the paranoia paid off for an early dx..  I have a nurse friend that always thought I was a hypocondriac when it came to certain aches/pains/symptoms.  I went to the Dr. twice with nipple discharge just 2 months after my yearly mamo. Both times to be told the pathology came back 'clean of cancer cells'.  I went back again a few months later after finding what I was absolutely sure was a fibroid  in the same breast (had lots of experience with fibroids), but just wanted to be sure. So, the sonogram showed that it actually was only a fibroid.  BUT that sonogram also showed a tiny 6mm tumor NEXT TO the fibroid.  Dx was Stage II Grrade 3! (one lymph node involved), and mastectomy.  My yearly mamogram wasn't scheduled for another 6 months!  So much for paranoia.  She now tells me ""well you sure showed me!"" and admits she would have probably not gone back after the first 'clean of cancer cells' report. She promises that she will now pay more attention to symptoms and follow up on all of them.  I guess it sometimes does take your misfortune to help others.  So I say, you go girl and always ""question"" anything !   MB
						

"
"


							Dear Lane,

Bone metastasis secondary to DCIS with out a local recurrence is not common, although not impossible. Since the painful spot is in the surgical area, you may consider that surgery or scarring may also be part of the cause. I think you should discuss this with the surgeon as soon as possible. 
To rule out bone metastasis, bone scan is quite sensitive, and X-ray can be used to rule out lytic lesions too. But since the chance for mets is not very high, your physician has to correlate clinically before making a suggestion to you.

Hope you get well soon.

							Hi Danielle, welcome to the board. Your mom's diagnosis sounds just like mine, a 6 mm (I think that is .6 cm if my math is right) tumor infiltrating ductal carcinoma. I had a lumpectomy, not a mast. You mom is a bit younger than I was at diagnosis. I was 50 -- just a few months shy of 51. My daughter was a student in college at the time. I know that she was really concerned about me. She went to her college professors and told them what was going on. They were all understanding and cut her a lot of slack in getting assignments done that quarter. Anyway, that was almost 9 years ago. Now, DD is married and has a DD of her own. I hope your mom has somone to go with her when she visits the doctors to talk about treatment. Your head is in such a spin it helps to have a second set of ears to help digest the information. A tape recorder also is a good way to make sure you don't miss any vital information. Please keep us posted on how your mom is doing, or give her this link and let her come to us. Sending comforting and calming hugs, Lauri

							Hi Lauri!!  It seems like your daughter was in the same situation I am in.  I am a college student, but fortunately I live at home.  I plan on attending every doctor's appt. with her.  All my professors are VERY understanding.  That helps a lot.  On February 4th, my mom had a lumpectomy, she got results back a week later.  They sent it to our local hospital lab, and it came back benign.  We were so happy.  BUT three weeks later, the radiologist found out that it came back benign and had the lab work sent to another hospital ( a much better more known hospital) and it came back malignant.  Invasive Ductal Carcinoma.  How are you doing now?  Did you have cancer treatments? If so, how did you do with them?  Let me know!!

							Danielle ~ I am so sorry to hear about your mom.  Of course, it IS a big deal and a lot to cope with.  Invasive, non-invasive, early-stage and late-stage cancers. . . they are all a big deal.  

BUT, it sounds like your mom is going to have a good prognosis.  From the information you have posted, she may not be advised to do chemo because it is a small tumor.  But that decision is also based on other factors, such as the particular biology of the tumor.  She'll be getting more information when she receives her pathology report after her surgery.  

I was also dx with IDC and had two surgeries, chemo and 33 rads and am doing GREAT!  I am now taking Tamoxifen because my tumor was hormone receptor positive.  Your mom will discover more of this information as she moves along in treatment.

							Danielle,

To answer your question  -- my tumor was 1.1 centimeters.  It sounds small to others, but when I found it, it felt very big to me.  Also, I have small breasts.

This is what I was told:  The general rule is that they start leaning toward recommending chemo when the tumor is invasive and 1 centimeter or larger.  But, as I said before, others factors also influence this decision.  Some of these factors are whether the her2neu is positive, whether the tumor is estrogen negative or estrogen positive, the grade of the tumor and other factors. Also, whether there are any positive lymph nodes will come into play.   BUT....there is a good chance your mom won't need the chemo, given the smaller size of the tumor.  Only time will tell.  And if she should need chemo, we can help.  Many of the ladies here have done chemo.

An excellent book is ""Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book.""  It answers any and all questions about breasts and breast cancer.  You should be able to check it out of the library if you don't want to purchase it.

Sending hugs,

Margie

							Hi Danielle,

I think that you ought to double-check that diagnosis.  ""Infiltrating"" is used differently sometimes, and is not necessarily the same as ""invasive"".  My path report said infiltrating DCIS.  I grilled my doc, and he said emphatically that what I had was NOT IDC.  Infiltrating DCIS is a higher grade than just DCIS, but it is not Invasive Ductal Carcenoma (IDC).  

Hope that helps.  Be strong.  She is going to get through this just fine!  And she will live to be an old lady!

							Danielle,

I am 40 and was diagnosed in Nov 2004 with IDC.  You can see all my stats below.  I am going through chemo now.  I also have a daughter in college.  She is 18 and attends school away from home.  The hardest thing we ever had to do was to call and tell her about my diagnosis.  She has handled everything well so far.  

Just know that your mom will be able to handle the treatment.  None of us wanted to do this but we all have been forced to deal with this crappy disease.  Treatment is not fun.....but it's not impossible either.  As for the hair thing...it doesn't bother me so much.  i just wear a baseball cap and don't worry about it.

							Could anyone please explain the relevance of PR and HER2 status? My path report only stated ER+ and at the time of dx I had not found this, or the UK breast cancer board so had no idea that PR and HER2 were done in most hospitals. I am taking Arimidex. Does PR and HER2 affect treatment? I had 6 x FEC, 45 rads and 2 boosters.
Many thanks for some enlightenment.
Liz.

Dx Jan 2003
2 cm invasive ductal, stage and grade 2  with intermediate grade DCIS, comedo and cribiform.
WLE and sample node removal 2/18 nodes positive
Total axillary removal, 1 more +, total 3/18
45 rads, 2 boosters.
Now taking Arimidex.
						

"
"


							Well I believe the Her2 negative is a good thing as those can be really aggressive tumors. I am Her2-.

Sorry don't know how the PR- effects hormone therapy as I am also PR-. I think either ER or PR+ can be a good thing as the tumor can be controlled with hormones. I am also ER- so hormone therapy may not be helpful for me. I'm sure one of the docs will explain it better, but it sounds like having some hormone receptivity is in your favor for being able to control your cancer.

							Hi Liz,


This is my take on hormonal status.  It lets us know what is fueling the cancer to grow.  These days, if you are either PR or ER positive, you usually have the option of taking Tamoxifen or if you are post menopausal an AI (aromatase inhibitor like Arimidex, Femara or Aromasin).  If your HER2 status  is positive it can qualify you to receive the drug Herceptin.  In the US it is only FDA approved for stage 4 cancer but there are numerous clinical trials using it for earlier stage women.  Also some oncologists prescribe it ""off label"".  So I would say the answer to your question is Yes, those things definitely affect the treatment you receive.  You should ask for a copy of your path report if you haven't already.  Best wishes.

							Hello

I agree with Susan. Knowing the ER/PR/HER2 status is standard of care now. It helps identify higher risk patients and those that would benefit from additional treatment.

							Hi All, 
Does anybody out there have any experience with taking mammograms after breast reconstruction??
conflicting answers on this..

							I didn't get a mammo on the fake boob, just the remaining one.  However, I am getting MRIs every six months, so that will find anything in the reconstructed one.  I am getting MRIs because I KNOW that that tumor that ended up being 7 cm(!) was there for years, and the mammos didn't catch it, and the surgeon didn't either.  I also had 2 others that I couldn't feel.  So I demanded MRIs and I am getting them!

By the way, I am 1 year since mastectomy, had my first mammo and MRI, and everything is fine.  Whew!

							My onc. keeps telling me I do not need to have a mammogram on the reconstructed breast.  So, I haven't.  I had a skin-sparing mast. on Feb. 6, 2001..with immediate tram flap surgery.  I hope she knows what she's talking about.  I ask her everytime I go for a check up and her answer is always the same...""THAT IS A RECONSTRUCTED BREAST, AND YOU DO NOT NEED A MAMMOGRAM ON IT.""

							Hello

If you have a total mastectomy, there is no longer breast tissue there, so mammograms are no longer necessary on that side.

							I am 49 yrs. old, was diagnosed 3/2001 with DCIS, rt breast, ER positive, stage 0. Had a lumpectomyand radiation treatment and was put on tamoxifen.  Only took tamoxifen for 5 months as I had terrible hot flashes. I was then diagnosed with LCIS, left breast, 4/04, stage 0.  As I had many calcifications, I decided to go with a bilateral mastectomy so that all could be removed.  My question is what follow-up care should I have.  My surgeon said I didn't need to return for 1 year and did not recommend a CAT scan or anything else to look at the chest wall.  I am very uncomfortable with this and am wondering what standard practice is in my case.
Thanks for any help you can give.

							Hi Sue, welcome to the board. You question is really beyond my scope of knowledge, but I'll harzard a guess as to why the doctors are not recommending a CAT scan at this time. Your cancers were found at the very earliest stage. You did not mention the status of lymph nodes, but I am assuming they were neg. Since the cancer was found at Stage 0 the doctor probably does not think there is any reason to do further testing at this point as it is unlikely the cancer has spread. This is just my guess. I was diagnosed at Stage 1 and have not had CAT or MRI scans. My onc. said blood work and physical exam just do not warrant these tests. Hope this help. I am sure Dr. Leo or Dr. Lu will offer their advice, too, as well as other board members. Take care, Lauri

							I too was diagnosed T1a and did not receive chemo or radiation after a bilateral mastectomy.  I had my 6M follow-up visit with my oncologist last week and had the same concerns you are having.  Since there is nothing left to do a mammogram on, how do you follow things?  She assured me that she would follow me with blood work and a chest x-ray every one to two years.  Since you were at stage 0 your visits may be less frequent.  My oncologist told me to contact her if I had ""unusual"" bone pain (not joint pain) or other pain I had a concern about.   

BC is a terrible disease, one that can raise havoc with your emotions as well as your body.  Take care and know this is one of the best places for up to date information and support.

							Hi Sue,

Unfortunately, follow-up seems to vary quite a bit.

I was dx in August 2003 -- invasive ductal -- did chemo, rads, lumpectomy and re-excision.  I am now on Tamoxifen.  I've had hardly any follow-up at all.  The last time the oncologist did any bloodwork was 3 weeks after chemo was completed (15 months ago).  I never had a CT scan or MRI.  I did have a bone scan when I was first diagnosed.  

So.....since I finished chemo and rads, I have ONLY had breast exams.  Nothing else.

I really wanted some bloodwork done at my January appointment with the rads onc and they said there is no need.  So.....I have an appointment with a new out-of-town doctor in early May.  If you really want a test/scan for your own peace of mind, I think this is VERY reasonable.  Request it and if they will not comply, look for a new doctor.  Sadly, I just don't understand why they can't comply with a simple test if it will make us feel better.      If they had to walk this path, maybe they would  understand.

I think it varies by region and/or doctor.  

Good luck and hugs,

							As far as follow up...I would tend to push for something.  But I had a friend who died last week from Stage 4 BC....thing is, it started out as DCIS stage 1 in 96.  By the time they discovered it had some back, it was in her bones and elsewhere.  She did what the docs told her then went on with her life.  She originally had no chemo and no rads.  And follow up was just a quick visit once every year or so...no tests, etc.  SO....because of her, I would push for something.  But that's just my 2 cents....Not trying to be negative...just think you should do what you can to stop this stupid disease.

							Sue,
Me too!?  I was diagnosed a year ago after a prophylactic mastectomy.  I went with one (similar to you) after 2 excisional, 3 core and 1 fine needle biopsy.  This over a period of 15 months.  They found LCIS on 3 occasions and aytipical hyperplaia each time.  I, like you, said the heck with this and said mastectomy please!  The pathology at that point came back with a highgrade DCIS with calcifications, necrosis and it was 2.9 cm.  I was really surprised that this could be hiding.  I am not a big person, about 5'7 & 127 lbs & was a size 34B.  Also ,I am not in any small backwater town.  I live in a major metropolitan area with access to great medical care.  My surgeon, like yours, advised me to visit him annually and reccomened no other follow-up.  YES, that makes me nervous.

Advise is as follows:  I would assume that you had to have been under an oncologists care to receive the tamoxifin.  He should be part of your follow-up care.  He is a great person to do blood work that can signal a reoccurance.   Also, try schedule your regular ob/gyn appointments between your surgical & oncologist visits.  This will increase the times you are seen by a medical professional.  Find out and be very clear on what reocurrance feels like, that way you know what to look for.  Consider enrolling in a cancer research study; this would be more opportunty for follow-up.

Remeber, DCIS is not considered to be invasive.  Overall the medical community beleives that it does not have the capability of spreading.  However, they will never say never.  You will hear that the risks are very low.  There are still so many unknowns about cancer and how it spreads, there are at this point no guarantees.

Since I did not have any lynph nodes removed or biopsied, I am planning on being vigilant.  There is such thing as micrometastasis.  Not usually found with DCIS, but I have been told it can happen.

Sorry about the long message and probable misspellings; but being in the same boat, I sure feel for you!!

Good Luck,

							Dear Sue,

Here is some information about DCIS and LCIS that may help. First of all, DCIS is precancerous, and the cure rate after mastectomy is very high (96-100% depends on which paper you read). After mastectomy for DCIS, no chemotherapy or radiation is needed, although some patient may receive hormonal treatment. Recurrence on chest wall is rare after mastectomy, although no physician will say 0% for relapse. 

LCIS is not cancer, but a risk for cancer. If left untreated, the patient will have high risk for invasive lobular carcinoma or ductal carcinoma (not DCIS), and thus prophylactic surgery is indicated for some patients. After mastectomy, there is no risk for having a new cancer in the breast because of the LCIS since the breast tissue is removed. 

I am not sure how soon you should see your physician but he/she may think a physical examination is more important than CT of the chest in follow-up. You can ask for an early appointment simply because you have concern about the recurrence.

Hope you get well soon.

							Hello All,

Thanks to everyone for their input.  I so appreciate the posts as I now feel I have some direction.  Actually, since my surgery was not done in our local hospital, I decided to have my surgeon follow me. (UVA) She wrote the tamoxifen prescriptions and had me do digital mammograms every 6 mos. I would then see her the same day for a report on my mammo. followed with a manual exam of my breasts. After my initial DCIS diagnosis, I did see the local oncologist for recommendations regarding treatments.  I also had radiation done locally as well.

Having said that, I will now make an app't with the local oncologist and have him follow me. I would like to have bloodwork done yearly and further investigate having a CT scan, MRI, or whatever yearly as well, possibly for five or more years.  Interestingly enough, because I have a family history of heart disease, my family Dr. sent me for a CT scan of my heart and also included having the axillary nodes looked at as well as chest wall since I voiced the above concerns to him. He said we would just take a look at both heart/arteries and chest wall.  Will let you know what happens with that and what can be seen as this might be something some of you might want to persue.  
Thanks again for relieving some of my stress.  Will post again soon and, of course, will continue to read the posts!  May good health follow all of you. What a great site.  

Take Care.

							Hi
I finally thought it was over, but was completely shocked when I went for my 3 month check up and my recent mammogram showed more calcifications. I am now booked for another core biopsy only one year after having core biopsy and then surgery to remove the area.I am also on tamoxifin as they found LCIS last year.I never thought I would be considering a mastectomy but see on this board that it might be a possibility. If anyone has thoughts on this please advise.......I keep thinking how many biopsies can we put ourselves through?

Thanks Lenora

							Hi Lenora,

As my calcs were scattered within the breast, there was no way to biopsy every one of them. My surgeon said they looked  like the biopsied group that were malignant. (I had a core-needle biopsy-LCIS.) My surgeon said she could watch me closely and I could wait or go the mastectomy route.  After thinking through the situation, I was uncomfortable with the ""watch and wait"" approach.  I was and am unwilling to take any chances so there I went.  I really felt I had no choice.  It was a very difficult decision and I cried off and on for awhile but  I am glad I had the mastectomy.  

I needed to know I had done everything possible to keep the cancer from returning.  I also looked at reconstruction and consulted with a plastic surgeon.  I did choose not to go that route though and I am glad about that, too.  If you need anything, please holler.  My surgery was this past July and I did great and am doing wonderfully.  Bounced back very quick. Let me know if I can help. In the end, you have to do what is best for you.

							We just found out Friday that my mom has cancer.  Liver and Lung.  She was a smoker and a drinker (beer) but Im not sure how that affected it.  She is going to see a specialist this week and will be starting Chemo soon.  She doesnt want anyone to know except my dad, 3 brothers, my husband and my brothers wife.  So while I do have people I can talk to about it, I cant confide in my friends about it, and Im having a hard time talking about it with my brothers since they are all dealing with it to.  She doesnt want any of us upset, she is trying to stay positive...

I was wondering from those of you with caner or with family members with cancer, what are we in for?  will she be able to keep it between just us if she is going through chemo?  will she definantly lose her hair?  How sick will she get from the chemo?

							Dear Bersly, Sorry to hear about  your mother.  My father has stage 3 non small cell lung cancer.  We found out about it a Thanksgiving time. He started on radiation and chemo at Christmas time.  Thankfully my parents live 3 miles from the Erie cancer center.  My father was bald to begin with so hair loss was not a worry here.   He did wonderful with the chemo. ( the radiation was everyday -5 days a week- for 6 weeks) The chemo was one day a week for 6 weeks.   The radiation is what has taken its toll on him.   His esophagus took a direct hit from the radiation.  Swallowing has become very  painful.  Weight loss is a concern.  The protein drinks such as Boost are great.  My father likes his food.   It is hard to watch him chew a bite of whipped cheese cake for 2 minutes before swallowing.  Last thursday he began the last 3 chemo treatments.   These treatments are separate from the 6 week rad/chemo.  This is the Taxo-tere chemo.  We were concerned about him taking this one.  Symptoms are different from his normal chemo. (tingling in fingers and feet)   This is monday 4 days since the taxo tere  and no tingling.      It has been one month since the last radiation treatment and the swallowing is still painful.  The doctors say one day soon it will be back to normal.   Our family was told the treatment should give him 18 to 24 months of life.  At this point he says he will not go thru with a second round of radiation.  At Thanksgiving time dad said no to chemo....  he changed his mind when the option was death.   He always was a strong brave man, but this has been a challenge that has taken a lot of courage.  He has missed one day of work- he works 7 days a week and is 68 years young.   The will to live is powerful.  Be there for your mom and she will be there for you.    To answer your question of how ill your mother will get from the chemo-  everyone is different.   Chemo and radiation treatments can be stopped at any time, but no good will come of the treatment unless the full treatment is complete.  Many of the women at the cancer center have lost their hair.  The cancer center has women who teach patients how to wear a bandana or a hat.   As to your question for what you are in for... knowledge about the cancer is powerful.   I go with my dad even though my mother is there with him, to the cancer center.  It is a help to me.  Even if I only take him a milkshake to have during his 4 hour chemo treatment, it is something I can do.   Have a good sense of humor.   Laugh.  Call your mom a little more often.  Tell her you love her. Cancer has a way of bringing a family closer.

							Dear Bersly, 

Sorry to hear about your mother.  I am a radiation oncologist but at the same time I am also a family member of a cancer patient.  My uncle died of liver cancer about 20 years ago.  It is very difficult for the patient and the family to cope with the news, especially after the initial diagnosis.  However, we all have to face that and eventually we need to fight the disease together.

For cancer with metastasis, the treatment is mainly chemotherapy.  Side effects of chemotherapy are very different, depend on the type of regimen physicians use.  Hair loss is not common, but does not happen always. Other common side effects include nausea and vomiting, fatigue, mucosal ulceration, etc.

Some patients tolerate chemotherapy very well and may not have obvious side effects, but some may suffer a lot.

Hope your mother will tolerate the treatment well, and hope there will be good response to the treatment too.

Good luck,

							Hello Bersly,

Sorry about your mother and yourselves who are all affected. I?ve just finished a very intensive course of combination chemo and radio therapy that lasted 4 months for a lung (bronchial) tumour (limited small cell carcinoma)? 2 sessions of chemo (each took 3 nights in hospital then 2 weeks to recover at home) then once-a-day radio sessions for 15 days and then 2 more chemos. Glad to say that it was successful, the tumour was wiped out and so far no others have been found. BUT to try to help with some of your questions (1)  both the chemo and radio therapies had rough side effects but mostly relieved immediately and very well with only a couple of different drugs for ex.  anti-nausea, anti-inflammatory, easier swallowing etc. and it hasn?t been as bad as a lot of people said it would be (2) find and contact your local cancer support group, very important to have others with personal experience to talk and listen to, for your mother but also for you, your family is not enough (3) don?t let your mother or anyone else feel guilty about the cancer, a lot of people who get lung cancer never smoked and drinking doesn?t necessarily cause liver cancer that I know of (4) why hide it from others? There?s absolutely nothing to be ashamed of, the more people who know about it the more to help you and your family, and you?ll be amazed to discover that almost every adult has or had personally or a relative or close friend with some form of cancer. Also, very very important, (5) stick to modern medical treatment, do not spend money on so-called alternative therapies, they don?t work and are often even dangerous by making things worse. (6) Keep hope always, statistics and numbers are just averages, they don?t apply to individuals. Hope this helps.

							Hello There Bersly,

I am the new therapist online here.  I hope that you are doing small things to help yourself, (nails done, hot bath with candles).  You have lost some of your support system and this must way heavy on you.  Not all losses have to do with death. Making a move away from friends, having a pet run away and not come home or even graduation, fall under some type of loss.  Certainly, you must have very strong feelings. I am happy to see that you came to Cancer Online.  I hope that you find this a good place to help meet your needs.  Because you have had a loss of support I am going to recommend a handbook for you.  James and Friedman are the authors and the title is, The Grief Recovery Handbook.  I think you will find it useful in many situations.  If you do read the handbook, please let me and others know if it was of any help to you.

							Dear Laksmi,
Sorry to hear that you have substantial side effects from Tamoxifen. In a sense it is true that Tamoxifen is a carcinogen, because it may increase the chance for uterine cancer. But the chance is very small and the benefit outweighs the risk significantly.
I think you need to talk to your physician about the side effects since I am not sure if Tamoxifen is the sole reason for the symptoms. I won't suggest you to seek alternative medication to replace Tamoxifen without talking to you treating medical oncologist at this time.
Hope you will feel better soon.

SIL itself will not spread and is not cancer.  However, it may progress and become cancerous (I think you are already clear about it).

							Hey ladies,  
Haven't been on here in a while.  Thought I would update you on my moms condition.  We finally talked her into going to lexington, ky to see an oncologist.  We loved him.  He was very down to earth and straightforward.  We said nice to meet you and he said no it's never nice to meet me.  He cracked a lot of jokes and pretty much told us how it was.  My mom's tumor was 2.7 cm 14 nodes taken out and i think 4 were positive.  He said she was a stage 2.  She starts chemotherapy april 1st and will do 1 treatment every 3 weeks with the first 2 drugs cytoxin and something else.  Then after that he wants to see how she does and 3 weeks after that takes another chemo drug once every 3 weeks 4 times.  Then she starts radiation and also taxominofen or maybe some other drug.  Can't remember the name of it.  I asked about her prognosis.  He said without chemo she has a 50 to 60 percent chance of it coming back.  With all the treatment 20 to 30 percent chance of it recurring.  She also has to have a bone scan to see if it's spread any and an echocardiogram to make sure her heart is strong enough as the chemo weakens the heart some.  He said he didn't think it had spread because she wasn't having any bone pain but he wanted to make sure.  Any comments or feedback on this.  I sure would appreciate it.  Good luck to everyone and your prayers are appreciated.  Sorry to ramble on so much but you ladies are sure reassuring.  Also anyone else on here with the same sort of diagnosis and your success stories would be very helpful to me.  Thank you so much.

							Hi,

Your mom's diagnosis sounds a lot like mine.  I had 3+ of 14 nodes removed and I was staged at 2A.  

I'm doing chemo right now.  Just finished the adriamyacin and cytoxion portion.  I had it every 2 weeks with a Neulasta shot the next day to boost my white blood cell count.  I had the ""dose dense"" method because I'm young and ""healthy.""  Everything went fine.  The first treatment I had problems with nausea but they adjusted my meds and the next 3 treatments were much better.  Just make sure to call the doc if she has problems with nausea.  They have lots of meds and some work better than others.  I start on Taxol and radiation next.  Radiation for 7 weeks and Taxol for a total of 12 weeks.  Then Tamoxifan for 5 years or have my ovaries removed...

Your mom will have days she feels good and will probably have days she feels bad.  My motto is ""tolerate the bad days and enjoy the good ones.""

I'm beginning to see a light at the end of the tunnel in my case and every time I go for a treatment....the light gets a bit closer and brighter.  

Good luck to your mom.  Hopefully this time will pass by quickly and then it will all be a memory.  She's lucky she has you in her corner.

Blessings to you...

							Hi there,

What you are describing sounds like the standard treatment these days, probably adriamycin and cytoxan followed by taxol or taxotere.  I don't know how old your mom is or how healthy but what is beginning to happen is getting those same drugs, only on a dose dense schedule, two weeks apart instead of three.  That could really interfere with your mom's immune system and blood counts depending on her overall health, although I thought I've been reading that older women are doing just as well with these treatments as the younger ones.  

In addition to the bone scan I would also ask for a CT scan of the chest, abdomen and pelvis to check for metastases since she had positive nodes.

I had the same chemo that your mom will and I will tell you that she will do fine with it, in fact you should stay on top of her to make sure she doesn't try to do too much.  The better she takes care of herself and rests, the more likely she will get through treatment with no problems.  That's not to say that she shouldn't get out, do some mild exercise, eat right and enjoy herself.  Just be smart and don't overdue.  

I'll be thinking about you guys on April 1st.  Good luck.
						

"
"


							Hi,

So nice that your mom has a doctor she really likes and trusts.  He sounds great!

I did the adriamycin/cytoxin every 3 weeks.  They didn't offer does dense at my hospital when I had it.  It wasn't bad at all.  I took the anti-nausea drugs kytril and compazine.  They have newer ones (emend and aloxi) that work even better, I hear.  Make sure she drinks LOTS of water (at least 2 quarts a day is recommended) the day before she starts chemo, during chemo and the first few days after.  The chemo goes in and does its thing and then you want to flush it out asap.  She should have a chemo nurse explain all this to her, too.  Water, water and more water is so important.

They also told me to gets lots of extra protein.  They recommended those Boosts or Carnation Instant Breakfasts  -- something similar to that.  I had at least one daily.

Your mom has an 80 percent chance of it NOT coming back after treatment.  Those numbers are pretty good!

Prayers and hugs to you both,

Margie

							Is it 80 percent?  That is really reassuring.  The doctor said moms cancer was moderately aggressive.  I guess that is good.  I guess it could be severly aggressive, I really don't know.  Mom is really worried about losing her hair.  I told her to look at the big picture beating this would be well worth losing your hair.  Her doctor told her it could grow back a little thicker.  He said it does in some people .  She was happy to hear that.  Thank you for replying.  I'd like to hear from some more of you!

							Hi,

The 80 percent comes from the statment you made saying that (after all treatment) the doc said she has a 20-30 percent chance of it recurring.  Mathematically, that would mean that she has a 70-80 percent chance of it NOT recurring.  

From my own perspective, I  like to look at it from the more optimistic numbers of it NOT recurring.

Regarding the hair -- it really did grow back thick, but very soft.  I got LOTS of compliments on the new hair...really!  Hers will grow back nicely, too.

Hugs,

Margie

							Hi:

I'm another going through the same treatment regimen that your mom will go through.  I'm stage IIA with a positive node and was told without treatment 50-55% recurrence and with treatment 20-30% recurrence.  (Just like your mom)  That translates to 80% that it will not come back...that's the number I focus on.  I was given an MRI, xray for lungs and EKG for heart to be sure I could tolerate the chemo as well as some other tests to be sure it had not spread.  The tests your doctor is going to do sounds normal to me.  He's just making sure before everything starts and that's what they should do -- no surprises.  

I started with Adriamycin and Cytoxin one treatment every other week for 4 treatments.  I also took a Neulasta shot at the time of chemo to boost my white blood cell count and was on Zofran for nausea.  The nausea meds today are really very good.  If your mom has trouble with nausea make sure she contacts the doctor to get something different.  After chemo I did 6 weeks of radiation which I just finished.  Next week I start chemo again with a different drug, Taxotere (similar to Taxol).  I'll do that once every 3 weeks for a total of 4 treatments.  Then after that I'll take a Tamoxifen or Arimidex pill for 5 years.  It sounds like a lot of work and a long time to get through it but it goes fast.  

I had virtually no nausea during chemo.  When I started to feel sick I just made sure I always ate something even if it was just crackers and toast.  You don't really feel like eating but it will help. I sailed through radiation with no problems and have continued working through all of it and just made sure that when I was tired I took time for myself and rested.  But this is not the time to be ""wonder woman"".  Make sure your mom gets rest if she needs it.  Everyone is different but more and more women are going through treatment with few side effects and are able to keep a good outlook and a positive attitude.  Well balanced meals and plenty of water will help also.  

My hair fell out starting with the second chemo treatment and that was worse for me than going through the treatments.  Be there for your mom during that time if she needs support.  Many women find it traumatic.  She might think about having a wig ready for when it happens.  My daughter went with me to the hairdresser to shave my head and that helped.  I already had my wig but she and I went shopping for hats.  There are some really cute ones and I found that I stopped wearing the wig and enjoyed wearing different hats everyday.  8 weeks after last chemo treatment and my hair is already 1? long and feels like velvet, but I plan to continue wearing the hats.  They are very fun.

It sounds like you found a great doctor.  That should reassure your mom and your family.   Talk to us whenever you have more questions or need reassurance.  We are here.  Perhaps your mom would feel comfortable coming here also.  There are many, many women (unfortunately) on this forum who have experienced so much and can share their experiences.  Also, the doctors can answer any questions that she might not have an opportunity to discuss with her own doctor.  

Good luck and come back to us when you need us.  Our prayers and thoughts will be with you on the first treatment.

							Hi Jamie - sorry you have not received any replies. I have breast cancer, but my twin brother had a malignant brain tumour and his symptoms were distorted vision, dreadful headaches  and unable to tolerate fluorescent lights. It took a long time to diagnose him, at first they thought he had glaucoma in his eyes, problems with his sinuses etc. He eventually collapsed at home and that was when he was rushed into hospital where they did a scan and found a huge tumour wrapped around his brain. In our family,where my husband and b-in-law have both worked extensively with radar, they are convinced it was the cellphones he used during many years of him working in the cellular technology phone industry - he seemed to live with a cellphone on his right ear. Of course, the doctors at that time, 10 years ago , would hear none of it, But neither would my brother. He died within a year of diagnosis. I am not trying to frighten you, but if you are experiencing such symptoms you should talk to your parents and have one of them go with you to your primary care physician to get checked out. Ignoring the symptoms will not make it get any better. It could be something quite simple like migraine, which tablets can help keep under control. 

I hope Dr. Leo can help shed some professional advice on your problems - he is probably very busy, as this website is voluntary for him, but I am sure he will get back to you soon.

Meantime, take care, and tell your parents or sister? - please!!
Love, Liz.

							Hi - 
Your symptoms sound very like a classic migraine headache.
Typically, it starts with an ""aura"" - distorted vision, so that the edges of what you are looking at seem to disappear, and often followed by flashing lights. Then the headache comes on......In some people it can last for an hour, in others  for 3 days. Feeling nauseous with it is also very common.I suffered from migraine headaches with these same symptoms for many years.
I would think that this is the more likely explanation of your symptoms, and therefore nothing to worry about....but I would get a doctor's appointment and get it checked out, for your own peace of mind.

Sorry to hear about this. Carcinoid of the appendix may be totally curable. There are treatments for it, and I highly recommend that you get the medical oncologist's opinion about this. There are ways to know if there are still cancerous areas there.

							Please know your full diagnosis before doing anything, question the dr. I've been researching all week on behalf of my girlfriend to no avail , her cancer is very advanced.  There is a dr. Sugarbaker in Washington DC who specializes in appendix cancer,  The procedure - Intraperitoneal Chemotherapy.  I do believe that this procedure would have benefitted her if we were fully aware of her prognosis right from the beginning.  Go to his web site - dr. Sugarbaker, look over procedure, and give him a call - do not let anybody cut into you, until you have all the answers.  I hope this helps, it would help me a great deal to know that all my research wasn't done for nothing.  Ask questions, even if you really don't want to know the answers  Maureen

As rightly said by Leo, carcinoid of appendix is totally curable disease. In early stages only surgery suffice.You will have to take the mediacl oncologist opinion just to get done some investigations which will rule out the metastatic disease. Best of luck

							Hey growler,
My husband just had a right lung lobectomy removing the middle lobe due to a large mass the size of a 20 cent piece diagnosed a the atypical form of carcinoid lung tumour.   Going to see his oncologist on thursday to see if there is any more follow up treatment for this cancer. We certainly hope not. Last year in Feb 04 he was also diagnosed with synovial sarcoma in his groin and had radical extensive surgery to remove part of his pubis bone, surrounding muscles, connective tissue basically everything within a huge margin from the tumour replacing the hole with a long muscle from his belly and skin from the same area to make a skin graft to his groin. Then followed 5 brutal rounds of high dose chemo ifosamide and epirubicin then 32 radiation treatments.   We though are so pleased that his lung mass hadn't metastized from his orginal tumour. Instead we received news of another strange and rare form of a primary cancer. What can I say my man is unique!!I just hope that we can ride through the next five years without a reoccurance which will give him the best chance of the monster not returning. We will beat this thing once and for all

							I had a WLE 1/5/05 and an AND on 1/25/05.   I started RT about 2 weeks ago.   My right breast has swollen (minimal, but noticeably), and because of that, there is discomfort bordering on pain.   I have no redness (yet).
I take motrin for the pain, which helps only a little.

I am wondering if the mild edema is due to my massage of cream into my breast three times a day (aquaphor); or is it due to having large breasts (normal cup size D; now probably a DDDD, if there is such a size as that)

My main question (and biggest fear) is that if I am having these problems so early in the treatment cycle, what will happen to me as the treatments progress?

							Hi Roxanne,

Sorry you're having a tough time.

I did not have any noticeable swelling.  The only thing I did was apply aloe vera gel to the breast twice a day.  My rad onc did ""peek"" at the breast once a week just to make sure all was well.  Does yours see you once a week?  He should definitely have a  look.

When I went for my initial consultation after I was diagnosed, the rad onc did tell me that larger-breasted women seem to have a more difficult time with the rads.  This was one of the few times in my life I was happy to be small-breasted!  LOL  He did say this was speaking in general terms.

Wishing you well and sending hugs,

							Update:
I saw my Radiologist today.   She said it is true, that larger breasted women have more problems, as there are more tissues which become inflammed.   
She said that when someone did have this swelling problem, it usually started almost right from the very first radiation treatment (which it did).   She also said that it did not progressively get worse, but instead, seemed to stop all together at the 4th or 5th week (she did not explain the physiological basis for this; but it is such good news).
Then she gave me cortisone for my very very sore nipple.    
She seems to think that everything is right on track, and I should not worry.
Just wanted to let everyone know what was occurring, or perhaps this information may even help someone else who may go through this in the future.

Radiation will cause inflammation to the breast tissue, and mild edema is very common in breast cancer treatment with radiation. Aquaphor does not cause any edema unless the patient is allergic to it.  Sorry for the late reply.

							I have had a soft large mass ( approx 5"" long, 4"" wide) on my upper left thigh for about 18 months, when I first discovered it, it was quite painful and discoloured but not like a bruise, it seemed very veiny.
I had not banged or injured myself, it just seemed to appear.
I went to doctor who after first saying that I must have one fat thigh (I weigh around 130 pounds) eventually sent me for a M.R.I scan.
The results came back and showed up as a large white growth that the specialist said was a tumour,  I was asked to go back 2 weeks later and when I did he said it wasn't a tumour after all, just an 'odema'
I never heard anything again untill I recently went back to doctors regarding something else and they asked me about it.
It is still there but only painful to the touch or when I am cold my leg aches in that area.
They have referred me back to another hospital and I am now waiting for another appointment.
The thing is because of the last experience I am wary of believing what they are going to say this time.
The other worry I now have is that for about a month I have had severe back and shoulder pain, and some discomfort swallowing food.
The doctor has said it could be an infection in my esophagus or a more concerningly a cancer of the gullet, he has done blood tests which I am now waiting for results.  He does think cancer is unlikely though as I am only 35 and not in the age bracket common for this type.

I am worried sick that the lump is a malignant tumour which has been ignored and now this possible esophagus problem is a secondary cancer.
Any advice would be a great help.

							Flameangel,

Thanks for posting. This area in your thigh is definitely a concern. If there is any question about what this might be, they might indicate a biopsy for further evaluate this and establish the diagnosis. Also, your symptoms of back pain and shoulder pain should be evaluated by the doctors. Other than that, make sure you make it to the appointment(s).

							My first chemo was Tues 3/15 and I was feeling great.  Yesterday I went for a scheduled Neulasta shot (to promote WBC production before it drops) and within an hour I was rushed to the hosp by ambulance.  It came on suddenly - Initially, I felt the bone pain they told me might happen but it was so severe I almost dropped to the floor, then a full body flush, heart racing, very short of breath and very weak.  By the time the ambulance got there (6 min) , I had developed severe stomach cramps, gone pale, worse shortness of breath and my heart rate went down to 50 -BP stayed in a normal range.  I was in triage when the cramping subsided and I started feeling a little better so they just monitored me for the next hour and 1/2 and then my vitals were normal. So it all straightend itself out without any benedryl etc. The pamphlet I have says Neulasta is made with the E Coli bacteria...   I have a call in to the Dr. (they had called ahead that I was coming in by amulance so knew about the reaction) and I want to know what alternative we have.  Today I feel crappy but I think that might be the chemo - little shaky, tired, just not well.   Does Dr. Jay have any insight and has anyone else out there experienced such a reaction?  (I think this is going to be a very long summer for me!)  Thanks for any insight you can give.  That was REALLY scary!  MB

							Thanks for all of the replies and good wishes.  I was feeling really crappy yesterday and the Dr. office called to tell me that the manufactuer said that my reaction happenes in 1 in 4,000 patients! My Dr's practice has never seen it so this is very scary.  As it turns out, Neulasta is a time released drug over a 12 day period so the office had me come in to be checked out and thought that I was feeling some effects of both chemo and the shot.  So they put me on Prednisone for the next 10 days to block the reaction and benedryl yesterday and today.  I feel better today but not great, at least I'm not as shaky, have a bit more energy and actually think I may be able to get in the shower but that will be about it I think, then back to bed. 

There is another shot that can boost WBC but it has some of the same componets in it so there's no way we're trying that.  So, my treatment plan has changed to once every 3 weeks for 4 A/C, followed by a lower dose of Taxol every week for 12 weeks (instead of 4 rounds every other week).  I'm now on the 6 month plan rather than 4 months.  

Since I may be having a combined reaction to chemo and the shot, can someone tell me what is 'typically' normal for a chemo reaction and how long you should feel crappy? Do you actually get back to feeling 'normal' between treatments at some point?  Thanks everyone, you're great support!   MB

							Hi Marybeth,

So sorry this has happened to you.  The complications we sometimes get may actually be worse than the treatment!

I did the AC every three weeks and the Taxol every week.  After the AC treatment I kinda felt flu like symptoms for about 5 days afterward.  Didn't do much except rest a lot.  The second week was better, and the third was enjoyable.  Each treatment was basically the same.  With the Taxol, I thought at first they forgot to put the drugs in the mix!  But what happened to me is it had more of a cumulative effect, the more tx's under my belt, the more fatigue I felt.  Also had trouble sleeping the night of infusion due to the steriods so I needed to take the Ambien just that night.  There is a new drug out, Abraxane (sp?) which delivers the taxol without needing the steriods.  Don't know if that would be an option for you.  Anyway, rest often, eat right, exercise mildly when you can (yoga is great!) and you should do fine.  Chin up!

Take care,

							I'm sorry to hear you went through all that as part of treatment that is hard to do in the first place. It is harder to follow through after something like that. My treatment happened before the current regimen became standard, so the drugs I had were different. For better or worse, I opted not to have any hematopoietic stimulant throughout treatment. 

I also had a few weird experiences with treatment that made it a little harder to go through with it. For better or worse, each time I chose to continue. One episode was a week of not being able to coordinate my brain with my fingers, and my fingers are part of how I make a living so that was difficult for me. Another episode was when I lost my eyesight for a very, very brief period of time. The medications hadn't changed, and no one knew what caused these problems or why they went away.

Thanks for sharing what you learned from your experience, and good luck with the rest of your treatments.

So sorry to hear that you are having a difficul time.  My chemo (AC)  experience was similar to others that have responded.  I had treatments on Tuesdays every other week with the Neulastat shot the following day.  I felt generally crappy for about 5-6 days...but then I started feeling better.   Another thing I noticed was my eyesight got really screwed up...that also seemed to straighten out after about a week.

							Hi Mary Beth.  How scary for you.  I did A/C every other week with a Neulasta shot at the same time I got the chemo treatment.  I had what felt like oncoming flu symptoms which lasted about 24-36 hours.  On the third day I felt great  and was able to work from home or go shopping.  I was tired and rested whenever I needed but it was very tolerable with the nausea drug I was given.   I wish you the best and our thoughts are with you.

							Hi again -- I'm feeling much better yesterday and today.  It took a while but between that WBC shot, chemo and Prednisone to block that nasty reaction, I'll have to wait for next chemo round to see just how chemo alone affects me.  Go for blood work Wed so I'll see if that shot did the trick it was supposed to (considering it threw me a whammy).  I guess a week post next chemo I'll have a better idea  of what my WBC will do on it's own.   Just thought I'd check in and thank everyone again for your replies, prayers and thoughts. Praying for all of you on this end too!! MB

							How long does the pain usually last after an endometrial biopsy???
Mine was done yesterday and am still hurting today! My Dr. had a hard time finding my cervix due to a large fibroid he said. I hope he didn't ""break"" something while doing this. Or is it normal to have cramping a day later still?

i had an endometrial biopsy about 2 years ago - i do remember cramping for about 24 hours afterwards.  you'll feel fairly normal again after 2 or 3 days. best wishes for a good result on your biopsy!

							I had the same thing done a couple of weeks ago, and I had cramping for about 4 days....but took Naproxin Sodium (550 mg Aleve) for it and it helped, because it not only helped the pain, but it was also an anti inflamitory. It will be better soon sweetie...I feel your pain.

							Hi Ladies,

I'm not a cancer patient but I did have a endometrial biopsy yesterday and had read you reviews of it.

I just wanted to say it was not that bad. When the doctor takes the sample I did get a shooting pain that I was not prepared for but it only lasted about 3 seconds followed by cramps. The shock of the pain made me dizzy and nauseous. I was ok in about 5 minutes. Drove myself home. I had taken 2 Biscopan plus before so maybe that helped. I had light spotting at first but woke up last night with proper bleeding like a period, not cramps though. Hope it doesnt last long.

Overall its not that bad but take a good pain killer, or even a bit of a sedative so you are more relaxed.

I am 54 yrs old post menopausal and found out because I was having slight cramping that my endometrial lining was 7.2 mm. Normal is 3mm.  Had ultrasound internal and external and saw very small fibroids, but nothing that would cause pain.  Also had blood test CA 125 and other blood test and all are within normal range.  I had a endometrial biopsy yesterday and was told I wouldn't know the results for 3 weeks and I don't want to wait that long.  I have no bleeding but have pain in my right leg radiating down to my knee.  I also have a tilted pelvis that causes pain.  My mother had uterine cancer when she was 75 and died a year later from it so I am pretty scared even though my mother had a lot of bleeding off and on.  I don't know if this could be uterine cancer or not but it is different than my mom's

							I agree it isn't that bad but it also depends on the doctor.  My doctor told me everything he was going to do and it put me at ease.  He gave a shot of lidocaine which I thought was the worst of the pain and it only caused some strong cramping for about 30 seconds and then I was able to relax.  I think it is more painful to wait for the results which takes about 3 weeks and I had the endo biopsy yesterday. I am experiencing low back pain that radiates down my right leg but the xray showed a tilted pelvis and I can do exercises to alleviate that pain.  I have no spotting or bleeding just 7.2 endometrial lining with some cramping and the leg pain

							Hi Sandy2ch,

My Mom just had an endometrial biopsy yesterday and she too is still having some abdominal discomfort the next day as a result.  She's 65 yo and her lining was measured at 7mm.  They only found this because she was complaining of a pain in her hip/groin area when she walked for a long period or climbed stairs...so they decided to do an ultrasound and discovered the thickened lining.  She also has no bleeding.  I guess at this point we just have to wait the 3 weeks and hope for the best!
						

"
"


							I checked this forum for an idea of what to expect before my endo biopsy today. Just left clinic and I want to share my experience also. I would rate the discomfort level very low. My nerves were probably the bigger concern. Only one moment of cramping when she started messing around with the ""straw"". It triggered what I would consider a mild cramp that eased a little and lasted the remainder of the appt...like the kind of cramp I would get as a teenager. In the car now and little to no pain. Maybe cramps will pick up later, but at this point I feel like doing it again wouldn't put ky anxiety in overdrive. I prepped by taking 600 ibuprofen, and the doc pushed some lidocain in with the ""straw"". 

Biopsy done to check for cause of excessive bleeding.

							Hi pdxginni -- Thanks for reviving an old thread on an important topic. I remember worrying a lot before my biopsy because I had read that it can be extremely painful. Fortunately mine just felt like cramps -- just like yours. Not bad at all. I took some ibuprofen before the appointment, but my doctor did not use lidocain. Seems like this test is fine for most women, but for some, it can be quite painful.

Hope everything goes well for you, and that your lab results are clear.

							What are the chances of having Lymphoma found during a routine biopsy of my thyroid after it was removed becasue of Graves disease. This was very unexpected and they considered it localized just in the thyroid. I had a pet scan and ct and they were negative. It has been one year since this happened. What are the odds of a reoccurance? The Docs say that they will test my blood every 3 months for changes becasue someday this will return? Any ideas?

Thanks for posting. You have already seen a physician, that seemed not to be concerned about this. It is a good idea to see this physician again if this is not improving. I can't tell you what this is, but you need continued attention from your doctor.

							Well we went to the doctor wednesday.  She will be going in for surgery next week to get a masectomy and reconstructive surgery.  They say its Stage 1 right now but they will check her lymph nodes during surgery next week.  She will for sure have to have chemotherapy   .  But we will make the best of it!  She went back today to talk to the doctors about surgery.  I'm really worried about it, but I know everything will be ok.  She is ok with the surgery and everything, but she's scared of chemotherapy (like anyone would be)  We are going to be looking for wig specialists to see if we can get her a wig b/c they told her for sure she would lose her hair.  If anyone has any info on wig specialists somewhere in North Carolina.  Please let me know. 

I appreciate all the messages and emails you guys have sent.  It means so much.  I look forward to getting more!   

Thanks so much,

							(((Danielle))) I know you are feeling overwhelmed, but  it sounds like your mom is on a good course of action.

							Hi Danielle,

www.headcovers.com
www.paulayoungwigs.com

These are a couple sites that might prove useful to your mom.  I didn't get a wig, but I did order scarves from the first place - very nice scarves!  And I have heard other ladies say good things about the Paula Young wigs.

Glad to hear they think it's Stage 1, but sorry to hear about the chemo.  I am surprised about the chemo - I thought there was a good chance she wouldn't need it.  Of course, we'd all be happy to help your mom deal with the side effects that chemo produce.  Another helpful site:  www.chemocare.com

Keep us posted and remember our prayers and good thoughts are with you both!

Hugs,

							Danielle,

Sounds like your mom is getting good advice.  I'm going through Chemo now and while it's not fun, it is doable.  One suggestion Ihave is if they give her an option to get a port....get one!!  It makes chemo so much easier....it goes a bit faster and they don't have to hunt for a vein.  In my case, they couldn't use my right arm which is where my ""good"" veins are so the port was a saving grace.  Another thign...if your mom has nausea after the treatments, call the doc....there are lots of meds out there and different things work for different people so they may have to try a couple of meds to get the right one.  

About the hair...I bought 2 wigs but have hardly ever worn them.  I like the hats better.  I have ordered hats and scarves from headcovers.com and they are good quality.  They have wigs as well.  Target and Dilliars are also a good source of hats.  I started out with hats that covered more of my head but now, most of the time I just fgo out in a baseball cap.  Your mom's oncologist should have info about where to get wigs locally....just ask.
						

"
"


							Hi Danielle:  Like the others have said.  This is doable.  Treatment is so much better now that it was years ago.  We women are strong!  I always think about the movie Steel Magnolias -- not because of the disease but because it is a reflection of women drawing strength from other women.  We have been given the ability to deal with whatever is thrown at us.  You and your mom do to.  I bought a wig when I started chemo but rarely wore it.  I, too, purchased from headcovers.com and found some of the cutest hats.  I've since bought more and wear them to work with suits or casually with jeans.  My co-workers say I am starting a fashion trend.  You have to make the most fun out of this that you can and from that your mom will feel in control and empowered.  Take care.  We are here when you need us.

							thanks for responding everybody.  I did check out the websites you guys recommended and she found 2 she loves and look just like her hair.  She will be ordering them soon.  Seeing that she could find wigs like that, I think makes her feel better about chemo.  
She goes thursday for surgery.  They will remove 2 lymphnodes to test them.  The doc says its only a 20% chance it spread to the lymph nodes.  So i'm hoping and praying he's right.  She goes the following tuesday to have a mast. on her right breast and reconstructive surgery following it.  
Thanks again for all the help and support.  If anyone has any more info on chemo or anything, please let me know.

Thanks again everybody

							Hello :),
I am looking for any information on what people did when they took Taxol as far as pain relief.  I have started on my regiment of Taxol for hopefully 12 straight sessions.  I've had my first cycle of Taxol on 3/14/05 and a shot of Neulasta on 3/15/05.  It is now 3/19/05 and I am having bone pains.  I've used a total of 7 xtra strength Tylenol's since the beginning of these new med's.  I really don't want to put anymore chemicals/drugs into my body, but I hear this is cumlative and I may well need to take something stronger.  I would appreciate any suggestions.  I do have prescriptions in my home of Vicadin and Percastat (sp) but have a very hard time even wanting to take them.  I have also heard that some people actually have taken liquid morphine to help them???  O gosh this scares me.

							Hi Annie and Fiddle

I too am interested in this topic.  I start on Taxotere next wed (3/23/05)  for 4 treatments as the onc thought it had fewer side effects than taxol so am interested to find out about how anyone is doing on either drug, what to expect, and what to do to get through this.  I've head bad things about both.  Anyone have thoughts on either drug?  Fiddle, what are you experiencing with Taxotere?

							I went through chemo Jan-Apr of 04.  Did 4 AC then 4 taxol, both dose dense.  I found the AC to be worse than the taxol, and for me the first taxol was the worst.  Maybe because I wasn't completely over the effects of the last AC as my treatments were every 2 weeks.  The main effect I had from the taxol was extreme fatigue--literally dragged myself out of bed in the morning, showered and sat and read all day until I went back to bed for the first month of taxol.  Took all of my energy to walk to the kitchen for something to eat--which I did regularly, by the way, appetite was not much of a problem!!  I had only minor bone/joint pain, and took ibuprofen or Aleve the first few days after the treatment, which for me was enough to help.  By the last 2 treatments I got some of my stamina back and was able to feel like getting out for short shopping trips, etc.  Hope you find, as I did, that it doesn't get worse with every taxol treatment.  Every AC treatment did seem to be a little worse for me than the last, both with appetite, fatigue, and general malaise.  Good luck with the rest of your treatments!

							Hi all,

I hope I didn't scare anyone with what I had previously wrote about Taxol and pain relief.  You can goggle any of the brand names or just the word Taxol (paclitaxel) and read up on what to expect.  I am also sure you can find the information suggesting why the 12 cycles.  Yes it does have stronger side effects then the taxene's (docetaxol)  but they tell me it is far more worth doing Taxol then to do the synthethics of the drug.  Also I am seeing everyone respond so far with 4 cycles dose dense.  With having no node's involved the doctors at Sloan and at my Oncol. office feel that 12 sessions of Taxol is one's best choice.  They have reports stating that the 12 sessions have shown a better and longer survivial rate then just the 4 dose dense or the 6 every three week cycles.  Seem's that all our doctors seem to have diff. answers or ways of offering the chemo.

I hope all goes well for everyone here :))..Keep intouch if there are any suggestions of how to respond to bpne pain and the neuropathies that can be involved.  Remeber if your extremities are numb have someone rub them so you can stimulate the the nerves.  Or take a good lotion and do them yourself.  I have been told it pas of in the long run.

							Marion, I'm doing Taxotere with AC every three weeks. I haven't had problems with with bone pain nor neurapthy either. I had my WBC drop low the first time and waiting to see what happens this time. I had my last dose on Thursday and am feeling very odd. Don't know if it's some sort or anxiety attack after getting sore muscles from a long walk or my counts are getting ready to drop. Talked to the doc on call and he said it could be either. 

I have been able to work on the 3 week cycles. My doc thinks the longer term survival rates are just fine with the reginime that I'm taking but should allow me to not have horrendous side effects.
						

"

							I'm doing the 12 cycles of Taxol....actually for the first 6 weeks it will be once a week then once every other week for three weeks but double the dose.  My onco thought that was the best dosage for me.  I didn't have too much trouble with the AC (I did the dose dense) so hopefully Taxol won't be too bad.  I'm doing the Taxol with radiation, so I'm kind of getting double whammied.

							Hi Shelly, Annie here.  How many Taxol's have you taken already?  How are you holding up? My doctor had mentioned to me that I could do the 12 in an 8 week period.  I'd like to do that!!  Yes I agree with most that the AC was harder then this is suppose to be but I am curious on the side effects since I handled the AC well.  Now it seems I don;t want to get out of bed and I only had one cycle.  :(...Right now I think the bone pain I am experiencing must be the Neulasta shot.  
Here's another questoin ladies, anyone of you decide to do Chiropractor, massage therapist or accupunture to help keep the immune system stronger?

							Hi all I have a question that I hope someone can help me out with.  My wife had surgery 3 month ago.  A lumpectomy and level 3 lymph node removal.  12 of 12 nodes were positive.  She is a stage IIIC and the margins are not clear.  She is presenty going through chemo and will still need a mastectomy followed by radiation.  She is doing quite well so far except for one problem. Since her surgery she has been unable to void on her own. She has to catherize herself every 3 hours.  We have been to a urologist where they ran some test and couldn't find anything wrong.  They told us it could take up to six months before bladder returns to normal.  We think someone screwed up during surgery and they aren't telling us the truth since the urologist is at the same hospital that the surgery was.  Has anyone else out there had this problem and if they did how long before bladder returns to normal.
						

"
"


							This has me stumped. I can't imagine how breast surgery -- even a lumpectomy -- would affect the bladder. Didn't bother mine. I hope Dr. Leo will respond. Maybe you need a second opinion at another medical facility. I just don't know why this might have happened.  Lauri
						

"
"


							What other health problems did she have (if any) prior to the lumpectomy? Her complaint isn't a common complaint among bc survivors. As Lauri mentioned, I would get another opinion from a different medical facility. We all want to trust our doctors and most of them are fine, but unfortunately not all of them are, and sometimes it takes years to weed out the doctors that aren't. 

A.A.
						

"
"


							She didn't have any problems voiding before the surgery. The doctor is trying to tell that the bladder was probally weak before the surgery and it got over stretched and will take a long time to return to normal.
						

"
"


							Have you tried looking at teh urologyhealth.org website to find out more about it? No matter what doctor you see, learning as much as you can about the problem will give you better perspective. I looked on that site using the topic neurogenic bladder because I really don't know any other cause for the problem, but there may be others.

I noticed a slight swelling a few weeks ago but discounted is as fat. Today, I noticed it is much larger and uncomfortable. I have never had such a problem in the past. I am 43 yrs. old, healthy but somewhat overweight. I am concerned that it might be something serious as anyone would. I will not have medical insurance until May 1st, 40 days from now. If I am examined by my physician and diagnosed prior to the enrollment date of my insurance, it could be considered pre-existing and treatment might not be covered. As a single parent and student, I am unable to cover these expenses. I am concerned that if I wait the 40 days, I could be jeopordizing my health. Please advise on what you think about waiting the forty days and the significance it might have on my condition. I could schedule the appointment tomorrow for May 1st.

							Dear JD,
I think you need to seek medical attention since that may jeopardize your health.  Although this type of symptoms can be cause by many conditions, one cannot be too careful about it. Unfortunately, we cannot tell you what the diagnosis is and what to do next, especially when you have such financial difficulties. However, nothing is more important than our health, isn?t it?

							My brother Jon, was just diagnosed with Esophageal Cancer 3/18/05 and it has spread to his lungs, stomach and liver and he has been told he has 4 months to live.
Does anyone have any information for me about whether or not he should have any treatments, would it be worth it or not.  He just went into the hospital 2 weeks ago with a blood clot on his leg that traveled to his groin area and he was in pain so he went to the emergency room and this is the diagnosis that he comes home with.  I know nothing about cancer, we have not had it in our family.  Any advice or anything would help, I really just don't know what is really going on.  I believe I am overwhelmed.
Thank you  [/i]

Sorry to hear about your brother. Unfortunately, there is little in terms of chemotherapy or other active treatments that can be offered for metastatic esophageal cancer. There are certainly ways to try to improve nutrition and strength, but this disease is very difficult to treat.

							Dear Kat,

I'm sorry your brother has to go go through this. My father is going through the same thing and we're hoping he gets through the summer comfortably. Palliative chemo has been a big help in making him feel more comfortable. If that is an option for your brother I recommend it if he is in good enough shape to take it. There are a few side effects but the benefits have far outweighed the negatives in our case.

All you can do is to be there for him and be supportive. I know my dad just doesn't want to be alone. I hope your brother starts to feel better soon!!! Please take care of yourself. It's easy to become overwhelmed. Make sure you talk to some one or seek supportive councelling. Councelling helped me after the loss of my uncle from the same type of cancer. It's hit my family twice. I'm happy for the good moments this time around. I'm doing my best to make the best of a bad situation. I hope you can do the same!! I wish your family the best.

							Hi!
I'm new here-hope I'm doing this right .History-diagnost on Aug 29th 2003
found lump in right breast-after mamo suspicious calcifications they thought in left breast-right side was just a cyst.After needle biopsy found it to be cancer,infiltrating ductal carcinoma, early stage 1, 2 to 21/2 cm had mastectomy bilateral on the left side removed about 16 lymp nodes all negative her-2 neu+.Since mastecomy no radiation,with four rounds of a/c.Finished up in January of 2004.Have kept all follow-up appointments.Still have rib pain al the way across the front of the rib cage,sometimes my entire rib cage hurts so bad I can't lay down-they have done bone scans and a ct scan to no avail.This is I guess something I must live with I guess since there seems to be no evidence of anything showing up.Right now my main concern is my remaining breast.About two and a half weeks ago during an intimate moment with my husband I started having severe pain in my breast-since then I have really sharp pains -it's not just the nipple but about half way up my breast,it doesn't look any different I can't feel any lumps-But it's so sore I can't stand to touch it,now that is constant,the stabbing pains just come and go.Is this normal ,does it just go away?I've got alot of other issues to top this of ---I lost my job last month and I'm waiting for my Cobra to be finalized so that I have ins. again.My gynocologist retired in Dec.04-my family doctor had an accident and know I hear he may not be coming back to the office.
I guess my basic question is this something that happens to everyone -can it wait-should I be concerned.Sorry to go on like this-hope this makes sense.If some one could shed some light on this I would really appreciate your help.Thanks for your time.

							From the amount of testing you have had I would guess that you may have already considered whether or not the rib pain is costochondritis...? You could have two things occurring at once, with one being costchondritis. Do you understand what that is? 

The stabbing pains and sore area of the other breast that you say is so far benign to exams is something I would continue to try to investigate, especially since you are losing the docs you have some experience in dealing with. 

Do you currently still have access by your insurance to a nurse call line to see if they have any suggestions?  I've used the one connected to my insurance several times (BlueCross or Aetna and perhaps others). 

A site that provides trained social workers who may be helpful is cancercare.org, also at 1-800-HOPE.

							Hi Sue, glad you found us.  I have to concer with Angel's suggestions. As I read your post about the rib pain, the first thing that came to mind was costochrondritis. My mother has had this and it was very painful. I also agree that you need to pursue the pains in your remaining breast. I may be nothing more than irritated nerves, but you want to know. Sorry about the insurance situation and the absence of your preferred doctors. What bad timing. Angel offered a couple of suggestions that sound like they are worth trying.

							Hi!
Thanks for your input.I've never heard of this costochdritis-but I will research it now .After so long of being in pain and no one able to tell you why you begin to feel like a hypocondriac.
Hopefully my cobra will be in effect within the next few weeks.I guess I'm going to have to start looking for new physicians,it's like starting all over again.But I know things could be alot worse so I'm not complaining.
Hopefully like you guys said maybe it's just a nerve or something in my breast ,it surely is  awfully sore though.
The pain in my ribs have been going on so long I finally came to the conclusion that it was something I had to live with forever.I'm going to search the web now for costochdritis ,see if symptoms are the same.You have no idea how that would make me feel if I could find a way to relieve this pain--Thank You Both so much.

							I found out that until I was the one who actually had the pain personally I didn't know how hard it is to tell which ones are dangerous and which ones aren't! I STILL have trouble with it and I'm more than 2 years out from the end of treatment. How are we supposed to tell the difference between costochondritis versus rib pain from metastasis to the bones? The problem really is not personal paranoia, the problem is the sneakiness of cancer. 

Medical providers should at least tell all breast cancer patients about costochondritis after surgery. It is hard enough to deal with all the anxiety we have.

Do you have any ideas or connections to help you smoke out some good doctors? What country do you live in... where are you?

							I'm in the USA,North Carolina.I found out today that the ins co has activated my prescriptions renewal-have to wait 36 hours for dr visits-go figure .Anyway I'm very glad that part is finally coming together.I'm calling the Nurse at the Hospital here ,where I recieved treatments to see if she can recommend a good Dr.-she always did what she could to make things as easy as possible when I was going thru treatments.
I've looked up costchondritis-two things about what I've read bothers me-first ,all of this time ,since surgery Sept. 2003,I've had pain not just on the surgery side(left) but also on the rightside-I kept telling all of the doctors I thought it was my Liver -they said no probably gallstones-finally after lots of complaining on my part they did an ultra sound of my Liver,this was around Nov. 04.They said I had a fatty liver,okay so what do I do about it and how did it get like this?I'll try to keep it as short as possible-about two weeks before I diagnosed I was extremely exhausted-went for check up,my cholesterol and triglycerides were out of the roof-chol-275/tri-700.They were worried about heart attack,right,then when diagnosed with cancer everything else got put on the back burner.The cancer was more important then.After the Liver test was done,the fatty liver  was due to my cholesterol and triglycerides being so high for so long-my.Last visit with my onocologist she ordered a ct scan,chest ,abdomen and pelvic.Found a cyst on my Liver supposed to have the ct done again in about two months.They said the cyst are common in most people and usually found when looking for something else and shouldn't cause any health risk.

That's my history in a nut shell-Right now after reading about costchondritis if i read it correctly-if you have problems with your liver it's harder to treat,is this correct? And that it usually only last about 2 weeks/or a lifetime.I'm still not sure what test they can do to be able to determine if that is the reason for pain.I myself try to look at things and do a proccess of elimination.

I don't know -I wanted to keep this short-but I don't think I accomplished that -HA! HA! Sorry! I will get things worked out -I'm eternally grateful to You Ladies for Your time ,patience and experience.God Bless You All!!!!!

							Once anyone is diagnosed with cancer, it is harder for everyone to figure out what actually is going on inside because cancer doesn't always just stay where it starts out. If you are like most of us, you will notice every ache and pain that you really didn't pay much attention to before, and you will also have more aches and pains than you had before because treatment is hard on everyone, whether it is chemo or the medicines you get to keep cancer from coming back.

For me costochondritis affected both sides even though I only had a left lumpectomy. I've noticed that every time I have some kind of radiographic imaging it flares up again (mammograms, chest x-rays, etc.). It takes a while to get a feel for what feels like what. It is kind of nerve-wracking because it is possible to have mets to bone (like the ribs) and how are we supposed to be able to tell which is which? 

I think your approach to finding a new doctor is a good one. Be sure to go online and look on your state medical board site to see if there is any negative information there about any doc you see. I learned the hard way -- the surgeon who did my biopsy had a past history in another state and I didn't know it... fortunately by the time she had biopsied me I knew something was not ""right"" and I got a second opinion and a very good surgeon who did the lumpectomy.

You and I both ended up having what is suspected to be fatty liver (although for different reasons), and like you, I was having some mildly abnormal labs prior to being diagnosed with cancer that are still slightly abnormal, so even though chemo is very hard on the liver I can't blame the problem on chemo. 

Is your sore area on the ""good"" breast still sore, with intermittent sharp stabbing pains? If so, that still seems to me like the top priority.

							Dear MP Collins,

There are several possibilities for the symptoms, but post-surgical reaction (side effects from surgery) is not uncommon.  Early stage renal cell cancer has a relatively good prognosis after complete resection.  Although recurrence of the primary disease in the abdomen is possible, usually it may take longer time. I think you should go back to see the surgeon who did the surgery for a complete history and physical examination.  If needed, the physician will order a CT scan for you to rule out recurrence or any other cause.

Good luck,

They cannot tell if theya re malignant until they take them out so they want to do a mast.  I've read so many ppl's profiles on here, and most of the ones that had a mastectomy only had to have radiation.  Is there a reason for her to do chemo?

"
"


							Danielle ~ If I remember correctly, your mom's tumor was 6mm?  That's why I was surprised to learn her doc is recommending chemo.  BUT....as I previously said, whether or not chemo is recommended is contingent on many factors -- lymph node or vasular invasion, size of tumor, hormone receptor status, her2neu status, grade of the tumor, type of breast cancer and the general health of the person.  Also, other factors such as age and menopausal status are considered.  The doctor looks at the pathology report and bases much of his decision on that. 

You really need to ask her doctor all these questions.

I have seen MANY ladies have a mastectomy and still do chemo.  So, yes, it happens quite a bit.

Good luck and hugs,

							Hi,
Just popped in to see how things were going.

I think the 2 main points here are the fact her mother has ""Invasive"" Ductal and also her age would be a factor.  I was 43 when dx and her mom is 44 and she's considered ""young"" so they would be more aggressive.
Also, I guess there are 3, oh well I can't count...  They are having to go back in and see if the califications are malignant or B9 and even if B9, why wait around to see if they become cancer, get rid of the breast and the prognosis is even better.  Why take a chance of having to do a mastectomy down the road and more treatment.  It doesn't sound like they got clean margins, which means the actual tumor will be bigger then .6 cm and most Stage I ladies I know are getting 4 rounds of AC since you can have a reoccurence at any stage, they are treating more aggressive.  Sounds to me like her onco/surgeon is on the ball and staying on top of things which is great.
						

"

							Also, you do NOT have to have positive lymph nodes to have chemo.  That's a consideration, but it's not the only factor in determining what kind of treatment someone gets or their prognosis.

							Thanks to everyone who responded and to everyone that will respond. I know lymph nodes play a big factor in this.  We go tomorrow for them to surgically remove 2-3 lymph nodes to test them. I see on everyone's profile on here about the PR/ER statuses.  They haven't tested her for any of this.  Do they not do this until after the mast.??  We have had one doctor say it was .6cm and another say it was 1cm.. we are leaning more toward the doctor that is saying its 1 cm.  
Again, I appreciate the advice, encouragement and concern.  Thanks so much to everyone!!

I will let everyone know thursday night how everything goes with her surgery.   


"
"


							From my experience from friends who had lumpectomies, they check the nodes at the same time has they do the lumpectomy.  If the went in and did a biopsy, then they wouldn't have done the nodes at the same time as a general rule I don't think.  I honestly can't remember if they tested me for er/pr status and Her2 status at the time of biposy when it came back positive for cancer or waited until my mastectomy.  I know now they do a lot of sentinal node biopsies vs. removing all the nodes like they did when I was dx.
My guess is, based on what I know, with or without node involvement, they would do chemo because she has Invasive Ductal BC, Invasive being the key word.

							Hello, 

      My name is Shawn , I live in southern illinois. I have had some wild symptoms this past year and it seems no one will listen to me, I am a 33 year old male and in august of 2004 i had some blood in my stool with some mucous on several different occasions. Since then i have had skin problems, a ""scratch' in the back of my throat and some other wild symptoms. Staph, strep and yeast in my feet, which went to my hands and then i went to several doctors who all they wanted to do is put me on a antidepressant which made me feel worse, all over. I have begged and begged to be checked for cancer, any type of cancer and the only thing i was told lol ,you ll love this is "" you are too young to worry about cancer' can u beleive that one, i sat there and i thought my god what is going on with this guy, there are kids all over St judes who have cancer way younger than i am and i cant even get screened. he laughed at me .one doctor told me i was a hypochindriac and i quit going to him, now i have went to the siteman cancer center in st louis, i thought this was going to be a oncologist at first but it wasnt it was a dermatologist specializing in skin cancer, geesh id dint even know that until a few days before i went. this was a wasted trip she said it wasnt skin cancer. oh well now i am back to square one, trying to find a doctor to listen to me and my bills are getting out rageous. this is so ridiculous, does anyone have any clues on what the heck to do to get someone to listen to you ? 
 I havent been irrational or acting like a nut but i would like to get this taken care of if at all possible, i mean this is going on 8 months now and tstill no one will even think of checking me out, what in gods name is wrong with these doctors around here? i am a police man and have served my duty for 10 yrs now, why can i not get someone to do the same for me ? i would just like to get checked out, is that so hard ? ]

Thanks for posting. I can feel your frustration about this. You certainly seem to have something that needs to be looked into. Skin cancer does not manifest like this, spreading from feet to hands etc. Also, blood and mucus in the stools are something that need to be looked into. The possibility of cancer is a concern, although very unlikely in your age group. Still, this needs the attention of a doctor. I know you've been trying to visit with them.... I believe the best thing for you to do is to find a good primary care doctor who can evaluate all these symptoms, and if necessary he or she can refer you to other specialties if necessary.

    thank you so much for replying. This is what my fiance and I both thought. I was like how can this begin like this, starts in your feet and goes to your hands? It's like crazy. What about skin cancer? Could it do this ? or MRSA? I mean this is so wild. I know i am jumping around alot here, but this is driving me nuts. I just got back from St. Louis Siteman Cancer Center skin specialist and she said it wasnt skin cancer. I am freakin out thinking I still have staph or something still in my skin , but one of the doctors I went to says that if I still had staph in my body id be on my death bed. The wild thing is i can be ok one day and the next i feel awful, i mean barely able to get out of bed. They keep wanting to put me on antidepressants, but they make me worse, i mean so worse that I end up in the emergency room every time I am on one.

   one last thing , could your lymph systen get congested without youhaveing cancer? And would it make you lose weight and resemble a type of cancer? They keep scraping everythng but they never do do a biopsy. Also since i did have that strep, staph and yeast conformed in my feet could that be MRSA? And how in the heck could someone get that just out of blue? I mean does strep staph and yeast cause cancer? Or is it something that goes nuts in your genes? Could the strep staph and yeast mutated my cells to trigger cancer ? Man I am totally lost here.

							Hi,

My wife is half way through her 6 weeks of Radiation. She is Stage one, unknown nodes (they weren't done) and she had vascular/lymphatic invasion. She had lumpectomy, chemo and now radiation. Her radiation is for 4 different areas, lump/aux nodes/intermammary/supraclavical nodes.

I haven't heard of anyone being this sick from the radiation. I know that it can be exhausting, but she can't function, and is so nauseous that she is back on the anti nausea drugs used during chemo (metoclop?)

She says that she just wants to go to sleep and not wake up anymore. This is NOT like my wife at all. Anyone who knows her knows she is very strong and does not complain about anything.

Has anyone heard of radiation being this bad or should we insist that she has something else wrong and it needs to be addressed?

thanks for any help.

							Hi, glad you have joined us although not glad that you have to go through this.  I finished 4 treatments of chemo Jan 5 and then did 6 weeks of radiation and now in my final 4 treatments of chemo starting today.  The only side effects I had with radiation was slight swelling, breast turned brown and started to peel and small rash that cleared up once I stopped using the lotion.  I was also tired but I think that was more becuase of the daily routine at 7:30 each morning rather than because it was the radiation making me tired.  I have heard that radiation can affect some women with nausea depending on the location and amount of radiation being given.  In any case, if this is not normal for your wife and you or she have concerns or questions about what is going on, I would certainly talk to the radiologist and ask questions.  I don't remember how long you said your wife had been doing radiation but most doctors will see their patients weekly to take a peek at the breast to see what kind of site reactions are occuring, draw blood occassionally and ask questions about any other side effects.  I would call the doctor to see what can be done and what is causing it if you don't have a regular weekly appt in the next few days.

							I am so sorry you and your wife have to go through this; especially after going through some of the angst which comes with chemo.

You write that: ""Her radiation is for 4 different areas, lump/aux nodes/intermammary/supraclavical nodes"".

Intermammary nodes are almost right on top of the esophagus.   Radiation to the GI tract does cause nausea.    As the esophagus is part of this 'alimentary' canal; the same could be happening with your wife.   The extent of her radiation to surface area is significant; therefore, radiation fatigue could be quadrupled.   My Radiation Oncologist said I could anticipate fatigue after only 2 weeks of therapy, and I am only having the right breast irradiated.    
If you couple fatigue with nausea, that could explain some of her symptoms.
I am so glad you will see the Radiation Oncologist today.    Please let us know what happens.
Good luck

							Hi, my name is Fred.  I'm a 42 year old male with swelling in my left underarm and running down the inside of my arm to just past the elbow.  I can literally trace what feels like a vein or something that seems to run from what I'm guessing to be about the axillary node? (I looked that up) and runs across the inside of the bicep and past the elbow and is making it difficult to open my left arm completely without some discomfort.  It's as if whatever this is has tightened up and is working against my arm as far as letting it open.  There is definitely discomfort in just touching the protrusion at any point from arm pit to elbow.  Everything that I've looked up regarding this seems to point towards women's issues in the medical web sites.  Has anyone else experienced this?  I also have another issue, and trust me, I'm not a hypo, lol, but while I'm here.....

I have a small knot in my scrotem.  It's not actually on the testes, but rather in the sac itself.  At closer look, it appears to be about pea sized and appears somewhat white-ish under the skin.....

If you feel a ""cord"" in your arm that is tender, it might be phlebitis, an inflammation of a vein. But you need to have this checked by a physician.

About the area you felt in your testicle, it might represent a small abscess, a collection of pus under your skin. I believe you also need to show this to a doctor to know exactly what this represents.

							Hi yes I know about ovarian cancer, as I have it. I had surgery the other day to check my uterus to see if it has spread there, it was called a hysteroctomy. which is a D&C, simply know as a curette becasue of thicked endometrial wall. Ovarian cancer you normally have your ovaries removed and sometimes if it has spread they remove all your organs like uterine, ovaries, cervix, felopian tubes, but you ucan never have kids with a full hystorecomy. stage one is normally confined to the organ and just required surgery, stage 2 means it is starting to spread and treatmetn is a hystorecomy and maybe chemo, stage 3 has metasised to other parts of the body like bladder, kidneys, cervix ect and that requres chemo radiaation therapy and a full hystorecomy and stage 4 is the most deadliest one. That si when it has metasised to the brain, liver lungs etc, treatment full hystrecomy, chemo and radiotherapy and HRT if a hystorecomy is done Hormone Therapy is given after a hystorcomy, and Taxol is a chemo drug used for ovarian cancer. if you need any other information leat me know

							an oncogene is the name for any gene which codes for a protein that is directly involved in regulation of cell growth and proliferation.  The non-mutated working form of these genes are known as proto-oncogenes, and are responsible for controlling how you're cells divide and grow on a reguar basis.  When mutated, these genes are known as oncogenes, since these genes code for proteins that regulate cell growth and proliferation it is reasonable to conclude that mutations in them MAY lead to cancer (where cancer is the loss of cellular control on proliferation and growth). 

These modified oncogenic proteins can mimic a growth factor, mimic a growth factor receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK), mimic a transducer, or mimic a cytosolic/nuclear intermediates of a signalling pathway.  

The second class of genes that lead to cancer are called tumor suppressor genes (or anti-oncogenes).  These genes when working properly restrain cellular division (provide a 'do not divide' signal to the cell).  When mutated this control mechanism is lost.  

The hardest part of treating cancer is that cancer can be caused by any number of combinations of oncogene/tumor suppressor gene mutations.  Often it takes a substantial level of mutation before cell division control is lost (our cells are VERY adept at controlling themselves), so one single mutation wont lead to cancer.  Mutations can be caused by UV radiation (light), toxins, free radicals, etc. etc.  Which is why we must make sure to eat healthily (many plants have antioxidant properties), excercise, wear sun screen .. etc. etc. heh.

Anyways, if you have anymore questions, feel free to email me, i've got a degree in Biochemistry and have led an active role in a proteomic targetted approach to breast cancer and prostate cancer lab research.

Is there a possibility that the nodules in his chest area are treatable as well ? or is it possible that these nodules are not cancerous ?  Also how would they test the nodules to find out if they are cancerous?

							Hello

The chest nodules can be anything. I am not sure if the area near the collarbone is a lymphnode, and the primary cancer is in the lung, but lung nodules can certainly be benign. 

To find out one possibly needs to have a biopsy, though this is not always necessary if this information will not change treatment plan, since biopsies in the lung carry risks that are not negligible.

Risks of lung biopsy (through the chest wall)
- Pneumothorax: accumulation of air between the lungs and chest wall, causing the lung to collapse.
- Bleeding: the needle can puncture an artery and cause significant bleeding inside the chest cavity (hemothorax)
- Infection: rare, but can occur.

							Hi, Roxie:  I too had my WBC drop dramatically during radiation after 15 treatments.  Mine from 3.8 after chemo down to 2.4 by the time radiation was over.  I asked the radiologist what I could do and they were not worried.  I asked the radiologist to consult with the oncologist to be sure as I was getting ready to start chemo again (taxotere) for 4 treatments and didn't want it to be set back. The oncologist agreed nothing to worry about.   I started taxotere this week and got the Neulasta shot and WBC back up again.  I would definately talk with your radiologist to see if there could be some other reason but mine was not concerned and everything appears to be normal again.

My husband, due to my concern, researched the net and found this quote from the National Cancer Institute on blood cells:
How are Side Effects on the Blood Managed?
Radiation therapy can cause low levels of white blood cells and platelets. These blood cells normally help your body fight infection and prevent bleeding. If large areas of active bone marrow are treated, your red blood cell count may be low as well. If your blood tests show these side effects, your doctor may wait until your blood counts increase to continue treatments. Your doctor will check your blood counts regularly and change your treatment schedule if it is necessary. 
As this is a quote which is taken out of a patient education brochure for any patient who may receive radiation, I thought it applied to me too.   However, as you disagree, I am now very confused.

Pat, I did locate the book you mentioned, and do agree that cancer is part of a mind-body-spirit continuum.   However, it didn't answer my question on white blood cells.   I like self-help books so will probably buy this and read it.    By the way, when you say you are a 'therapist', what type of therapist.   I am unacquainted with the initials you use behind your name.

Sorry, I didn't mean to confuse you. I don't disagree at all with what the pamphlet says. What I meant is that radiation can cause decreased WBC if large areas of you bone marrow are irradiated. But in Medicine anything can happen, and low WBC can lead to delays in treatment.

							HI Roxi:  Sorry you have had this confusion over the WBC's.  Sometimes, I think every person reacts so differently to the cancer treatments that it is hard to predict what is actually normal.  My radiation oncologist said that my counts might drop only because my bone marrow bank had been drawn upon 8 times with my A/C and Taxol dose dense treatments. With Neulasta, I always recovered enough to receive my next dose of chemo. However, you can only make so many withdrawls from the bone marrow bank.  It made sense to me.  I think my counts remain ok and I just completed my 21st treatment.  I was also worried about my RBC's as I was anemic throughout my chemo with a HGB in the 10 range.  I am now up to 13. I had Aransep shots everytime I got chemo.
I do have some fatique now but it is nothing like what I experienced with chemo.  Hugs, sharon

I am scheduled for lumpectomy and SNB on Monday 3/28.  I have infiltrating ductal carcinoma 1cm, ER+/PR+ Her2Neu -.  I am here from Canada with my husband who was transferred down here with work.  His job was terminated the day we got the diagnosis, and we are now faced with selling our home at the same time I am having surgery, and he is looking for another job back in Canada (not allowed to stay in States with visa we have).  Has anyone out there had lumpectomy in Atlanta recently that can give me some advice?  Also, does anyone out there have any experience with doing this using homeopathy (not for the actual lumpectomy, but for pain management and nausea post-op).  My mother was just diagnosed with her third go-around in the same breast (she had a radical mastectomy in 1983, then the cancer resurfaced in 1994 in her pleural sac, same side; treated successfully with Tamoxifen until this month, when it has recurred as a small lump in the surgical scar from the original mastectomy - she starts radiation in April in Canada.)  We are feeling just a bit overwhelmed.  Any advice or guidance from survivors would be greatly appreciated.

I am so sorry you are having to go through all of this.  There is help out there for breast cancer.  I don't know your job or m oney situation, but there is soemthing called breast cancer medicaid for people with out insurance.  It pays for EVERYTHING.  Bill Clinton passed it a few years back.  If you are under these circumstances, you should definitely check into this.  My mom had a lumpectomy.  She was back to work the next day, never sick or anything afterwards.  So you should be fine.  I think its a pretty simple and routine surgery.  My mom is going to have a mastectomy tuesday b/c she still had some calcium deposits scattered around in her breast, they're not sure if they're cancer until they take them out and since they're scattered, if they took them out piece by piece, it would already take  off half of her breast so for precaution, they are going to go ahead and to a mast.  
I hope everything goes ok with you.  I will certainly be praying for you and you will be in my thoughts.  Please let us know how everything goes when you recover from surgery.  
Do they know if its cancer yet?  let us know!

							Thanks Roxanne.  You sound like you have experienced what I am about to do quite well.  I understand about the pain and catching it before it starts; where I am anticipating having some difficulty is when they want to give me benadryl, valium and scopalomine at 10 am when the wire localization isn't until 11:30, dye injection at 12:30 and surgery at 2:30.  Because I am allergic to so many drugs, and any ONE of the above will knock me out, I am hoping that they will let me bypass them and just have the anesthetic at the surgery time.  My understanding is that they will be giving me lidocaine to numb the breast prior to the localization; they didn't give me anything for the double core needle biopsies except lidocaine and I did fine.  I worked in Canada for a naturopath/homeopath for a number of years, and I have done root canals with only homeopathic remedies, no tylenol, nothing.  So I know homeopathy works for me, I am hoping the anesthesiologist will be accepting of that.

As far as I know, they are just doing sentinal node biopsy; unless the frozen section shows something, in which case the will do the axillary.

I will take your advice to heart, however, about the pain meds afterwards!  And I am sure I will be eating something before, since I will have had nothing to eat for 24 hours by the time I get home tomorrow night.

Thank you for your response; I hope your Easter was wonderful.  We spent ours wallpapering our guest bathroom!

That was sufficient.   Really didn't need anything else. (and I am the biggest pain whimp that has walked the face of the earth)
the wire localization was a piece of cake; especially compared to a biopsy.    The radioactive dye/tracer used to be very painful (burning pain, like bee venom); but they have since diluted the tracer, so it is nothing either.    
maybe you could discuss this with them, especially if you have these adverse reactions to those drugs.

							Hi Roxanne:

I agree with you about the drugs!  I had a wonderful experience (given the circumstances!) yesterday.  The surgeon agreed I didn't need the drugs if I didn't want them (they are the standard run down here - apparently most women want to be ""out of it"" for all the pre-op stuff - personally I would rather be aware and alert!  Neither the wire localization nor the tracers were painful (like you said, nothing like the biopsies!). I did take the benadryl and pepcid immediately prior to surgery as they were to prevent any allergic reaction to the massive amounts of blue dye they were about to inject in the OR (Have a long history of weird drug reactions).  

The sentinel node was clean - now we wait for 3 days for  the actual biopsy of the nodes to return.  I slept well when I returned home.  I am using mainly homeopathy for the pain and nausea (of which there was very little surprisingly).  I have used tylenol extra strength twice and slept for 3-4 hours each time.  The breast pain is almost nonexistent (even tho I am not wearing a bra) and the node site is tender and achy (the reason I'm not wearing a bra!).

You have no idea how helpful you have been with your encouraging emails.  I am the first of my friends to go through this, and with my mom having her third go-round at the moment I don't want to ask her a lot of questions.  Plus she hasn't experienced this procedure, so she wouldn't be of much help!

Thank you again!  May God bless you abundantly for your care and commitment to this site.

							Hi Everyone,
I need help in figuring out why I'm still tired and have insomnia.
I finished 7 weeks of radiation for DCIS on 12/23/04.

I've been taking Effexor XR for hot flashes (75 mg daily) and I've been having a terrible time sleeping through the night.  I usually wake up between 0330 and 0430.  During the day, I feel like I can nap but when I try, I never can get to sleep.  I also have a terribly dry mouth all the time.

I am VERY tempted to go back on my bio-identical hormones which I only took for 3 1/2 weeks before I was diagnosed with DCIS.  I felt so normal during those 3 1/2 weeks - no hot flashes, night sweats, my memory was better and I slept wonderfully.

I'm wondering if anyone else is taking Effexor XR and having the symptoms I describe?  I can't imagine it's still the after effects of radiation.  I just can't keep this up.  I can't get back into my normal routine because of this tiredness.  I'm feeling depressed about all this and here I am taking an anti-depressant (for hot flashes not depression!).  I am most always a happy go lucky woman but these days I feel my strength waning.  

Any advice ladies (or gentlemen)?

Thank you.

							Hi, I've been gone for a few days, so did not get a chance to respond to you sooner. I think the post  radiation fatigue is pretty normal. I remember it took many, many months before I really felt good again. But, to be on the safe side, I would check with your doctor. Discuss your problem sleeping, too. Perhaps, something like Ambian might help you get enough rest. I would be VERY cautious about even thinking about going back on your bio-identical hormones. This again should be an issue you discuss with your doctor. Welcome to the board. Hope you get some other useful advice. Take care, Lauri

							Hello

I agree with Minnlady. The fatigue associated with radiation can persist for months. There are of course other things that might be going on too, so maybe the radiation is not to blame. 

Your comment about hormones... I would be hesitant to start taking those again. Despite being natural and all that, they are chemical substances that may have the same effect as estrogen, which is absolutely off the table for those with a histroy of breast cancer. Please discuss this with your physician(s).

							Dr. Leo can you please advise me if alkaline phosphatase blood tests and normal x-ray of the hip can diagnose bone mets from breast cancer? I have had recurrent, at times , severe (in bed usually) pain in my left hip.
I have had alk phos test, x-ray (but not bone scan), both normal  and am now undergoing weekly physiotherapy, which is painful. My physio tells me she can only rotate my left hip 50% compared to my right hip. I can walk okay, but have great difficult putting my left leg up on a foot stool and have pain especially in bed, and am awoken almost every hour with the pain. My annual breast cancer check-up has just been postponed by my local hospital (UK - socialised medicine - need I say more?) and I have other issues like a ropey kind of lump in the breast where I had the tumour, and a fall, concussion and blackout recently. Had to get paramedics and was hospitalised. Neurosurgeon  in ER said I was okay, although I had a boggy haemotoma, whatever that is. No Catscan was done of my head.   I am really worried about mets. I have also had Crohn's disease for some 35 years, most of them on steroids but now on methotrexate, and holding!!

History:

Dx invasive ductal carcinoma 2 cm, with associated intermediate grade DCIS, comedo and cribriform. Jan 2003. Stage and grade 2.
WLE and 8 sample nodes removal Fev 2003 - 2 nodes cancerous.
Total axillary removal March 2003, one more node positive. 3/18+
ER+ - PR and NEU2 not known.
6 x FEC and 46 grys rads with 2 boosters.
On Tamoxifen 3 months, then switched to Arimidex, a year now.

Thank you, Liz.

Sorry it took me a while to get here. Busy !

Anyway, your hip pain may be related to degenerative arthritis. The normal alklaline phosphatase and normal x-rays are good signs, but the test of choice is really a bone scan or a CT-scan. I don't know your age or body composition, but if you are an older lady and/or overweight it is possible that your hip just ""wore out"". 

Hope I have helped

							Thank you Dr. Leo for your reply. I am 60 yrs old and weigh 120 lbs, not overweight at all. I asked my GP (only peson I seem able to get to see) if he thought it might be arthritis and he said this would have shown on the x-ray. He doesn't see the need for a bone scan, feeling the alk blood test and x-ray were sufficient. The physio thinks it is to do with a nerve in my spine (L4 and L5 vertebrae have collaped due to long term steroid use).  When I finally get my annual check up with the breast surgeon I will ask for his opinion and perhaps he can order a bone scan. I wonder if it is a side effect of Arimidex as bone/joint pains seem prevalent. 
Many thanks, Liz.

							Hi Liz, I can't really answer your questions, but it looks like Dr. Leo has started a dialogue with you. I just wanted to welcome you to your board. Sorry you have a need to be here, but glad you found us. It is always nice to have access to people who have ""been there and done that."" I am hoping that your hip pain is just arthritis. Sad isn't it when we hope for arthritis? Take care and don't hesitate to bring your questions and concerns here. Lauri

							Dizzibuff,

Because of your compression fractures, you already have established osteoporosis, so a lot of things can happen. Still, even if you got a bone scan it could light up, but it can be hard to differentiate purely degenerative arthritis from a bone metastasis. Even if you are not overweight, you can still have degenerative arthritis, and if your hip is severely damaged you might be a candidate for a hip replacement. Please bring up that issue with your doctor.

best regards,

							Dr. Leo - thank you for your kind response. I am seeing the physio again today for treatment. She said if it is no better after this 5th therapy she will refer me back to my GP for a bone scan - she is unable to authorise it. In the meantime I have received an appt with my breast surgeon for annual check up on 19th April and will bring this to his attention.
There was an article in a national UK newspaper last week detailing magnetic resonance neurography for back/hip pain, which can show nerves - it has been developed by CedarsSinai but I doubt it is available where I live, or even in the UK. As she thinks my problem is either a trapped or inflamed nerve, this would be the course to take. Thank you for your help and insight.
Liz.

							Saw my lovely young female physio today - showed her the article on magnetic resonance neurography and she had never heard of it - not surprising in this backwater of South West England. She did some more therapy today and can move my left leg a lot more without pain - now she tells me it is muscular, something to do with the piriformis muscle and a nerve being trapped there. I think she is grapsing at straws because she really wants my GP to send me for a bone scan, which he has so far ruled out.  Guess I won't settle until I get a bone scan and can rule out bone mets.  Thank you for being there for all of us - we should all have such a caring and compassionate doctor as you.

							Hi Liz,
Like you, I'd want a bone scan to be sure it wasn't bone mets but I can tell you from experience, Arimidex can cause some major pain.  I had a bone scan because of hip pain that was new (had stiffness and pain in my finger joints/feet and ankles, which started shortly after the Arimidex).  I just knew it was bone mets, but that's the 1st thing we think about.  My bone scan was fine, showed some degenertive (sp) places and 3 healing fractured ribs (not a clue how I did that).  I also had a bone density test which showed the very earliest stages of osteoporosis (sp) so my onco went ahead and put me on Actonel.  Within 2 weeks (you take it once a week) I had no hip pain, no feet/ankle and finger pain and have felt SO much better, almost human..... lol  I had lower back pain and by physical exam, my onco said it was a disk, but he saw how stressed I was, so he went ahead and sent me for a MRI and, it was a herniated disk, no mets.  We are going to feel pain, that had we had it before BC, we wouldn't have thought anything about it, but now, everything scares us unfortunately.
Just wanted to give you my experience with bone/joint pain and what I found out.  I celebrated having a herniated disk and only we can celebrate something like that ...... lol
Hopefully someone will get that bone scan scheduled and find out what's going on and you might want to ask about Actonel or Fosamax to help strengten the bones, because Arimidex will do a number on them.   Praying for good results and relief from the pain.
Hugs

							Nancy, thank you for posting - so good to know others care. I saw 3 different doctors on Tuesday at the Breast Care Centre - surgeon has ordered a bone scan, but thinks the pain is due to sciatica. Has told me to continue with weekly physio until we get the bone scan and the results.
Ropey lump in breast has turned out to be thrombophlebitis in a vein - never heard of it before. The Director of the Clinic did the final ultrasound and came up with that dx - she said it is rare, but nothing to worry about. She must have seen thousands of breasts so feel I can trust her judgement.
Hugs, Liz.

							At the beginning of the year I had a very large Cyst removed from my ovary
15cmx15cmx9cm, I was in theatre for over 2 hours, to cut a long story short they removed the Cyst, Ovary and Fallopian Tube, 3 weeks later I was called in and I had a Yolk Sac Tumour which they removed however my bloods are elevated (markers), they should be 8-10, and were at 200, then 2000 and currently at 3000, I am being told that my cancer is very rare and it is that similar to testicular cancer and that is how they are going to treat me. I started my chemo 3 weeks ago, 3 quite intensive days, and go back for 3 more lots, my hair came out almost immediately and my boyfriend of 8 years shaved it all off and then shaved his too. I just wish I knew more and wish the Doctors did too. I am trying not to get too downbeat about it but I am only 34 with a 13 year old son, everyone is being very supportive and reassuring but I totally believe that unless you are in the position you really don't understand.

							Thank you for replying, I went in for my 2nd chemo batch today, but had to wait for updated bloods as my blood count was too low when they checked it on friday but fortunately it came back okay today.

							I too was diagnosed with yolk sac tumour last November. The tumour which was 16cm was removed along with the left ovary was in theatre for 4 hours and had to have 5 units of blood as it was haemorraging, my tumour marker was 54,000 after the operation and took 6 cycles of intensive chemo to get it down into the normal range. I had 2 cyles of 5 day BEPs and 4 cycles of 5 day EPs.

I'm sorry it didn't sound like your consultants were very helpful towards our condition. I understand your frustration at not finding information about yolk sac tumours, I found very little myself, (but did find more uk sites with information than worldwide searches) but my consultant was more than happy to give me literature on the subject although at the time I did not want to know all the ins and outs, although since I have had the all clear, I have become more curious. 

I understand how frustrating it is not having such a commonly known cancer, and how awful it is to have it at a young age, I was 24 when I was diagnosed last year. I finished my treatment in March this year, and thankfully starting to put my life back together. I would like to say that I have fully recovered but I am still suffering from the after effects of such intensive chemotherapy, with uncomfortable numbness and pins and needles in my hands and feet, but to be well, I can live with that.

Hope you made as good a recovery as myself

							I know that one of the side effects of Taxotere is joint pain 2-3 days after treatment.  And here it is right on schedule.  I have to say this is some of the worst pain I have had.  The other chemo treatments (A/C) had their own side effects to deal with and those were tolerable but this one is new.  I just took my first treatment on Wednesday and pain started on Friday.  I've talked to the oncologist and am able to take a Lortab (pain killer) for the pain but hate to do that for any length of time.  They said the pain would last several days.  Has anyone had joint pain with Taxotere and were you able to find relief with anything other than pain killers?  How long did the pain last?  I assume after treatment was finished the side effects went away?  I'm trying to convince my husband that this is a great excuse for a weekly massage

							Oh yes.....taxotere does give you joint pain.....and muscle pain (actually that was worse for me)....and it also took a long time to go away after treatment.(sorry)
 But I wonder if you are getting either neupogen or neulasta for your WBC? They are notorious for giving pain, particularly in the lower back and the ""long"" bones.....actually a lot more severe than pain from taxotere.I experienced severe pain with my first lot of neupogen shots, but the subsequent ones were a lot less painful, more like aches and not really a problem. Hope your pains resolve soon!

							Hi, Sam:  Yes I am getting Neulasta shot each treatment, however, I got those in the fall with my A/C and had absolutely no pain and no problems.  That's why I'm a little confused with this one although I guess the Neulasta could react differently with a different drug.  When I talked with the oncologist they first suspected Neulasta until I told them I had it previously with no problems.  I am to see the onc next week for blood work and will ask direct questions then because this is almost unbearable.  Thanks.'

							I've had two rounds of TAC and have my 3rd tomorrow. After the first one I had no pain.

I used massage and meditation to relieve the pain and it did after a day or so.

Hope this time goes smoother. I'll stick with the Neulasta for now as my WBCs got very low the last two times and I'm working full time as an elementary school teacher.

							I am currently on Taxol #3/4 and yes, about day 3 after treatment at exactly 2PM the pains in hips, knees, behind and feet start. All I do is go to bed with 2 Motrins and 1 Lortab. The bedrest helps a lot. I also started to take Vitamin B6 200 mg per day before starting Taxol, and I drink Tonic water because it ahs some quinine in it. Imust say that the pains start to subside by the latter part of the next day and are gone by the fifth day after treatment. And I have not ahd any neuropathy (tingling, numbness of feet  and hands). I find this to be bearable especially if it is the weekend. 

Good luck and I am absolutely certain that this is well worth it for all of us, esp in light of the announcements today in the Lancet about chemo after surgery and its success even with the old regimens.

I get taxol on mondays weekly.  12 in a row.  By thurs. I am fatigued, and feel sharp pinching bone pains spasam thru the inner inside of my bones Hmmmm does it feel like that to you too?  Strange stuff huh.  I also get it in my ears (like swim ear) face bones sometimes hurt too.  But it hits fast and leaves fast too.  Get massages, from pro, or hubby or kids or girl friends.  Rub and massage ur hands and feet as much as poosible for the numbness associated problems.  Keep them stimulated. DRINK ALOT of water ALWAYS.  Keep very hydrated.

Ihave invasive DC, scheduled for lumpectomy on 4/1/05 with SNB and wire localization previous to surgery. Does anyone know if this wire localization procedure is painful??
Ihad a bad experience with core needle biopsy (not being completely numbed up) so I felt the first two extractions. So I'm a little nervous about being poked at again.Any info appreciated and thinking of all.

							Sorry that you have been diagnosed and have ended up on our discussion group.  However, there are a lot of wonderful women here who will help you cope and give you advice.

I had the wire localization done before the lumpectomy and as I recall there was no pain.  They did a good job of numbing the area and there was no pain after recovery.  I would, however, talk with your surgeon and others to tell them of your concerns and past experience to be sure they understand that this is important to you.  I found it never hurts to remind them that you're not a number and that you are a team working together to provide you with the best health options there are.

							I also had a wire localization.    I was so afraid before hand, and insisted that the doctor write an order for a 'strong' relaxant.     He agreed.   However, somewhere in the confusion of the day, the order was overlooked, and I was wheeled to Radiology without any pre-meds.   I was so afraid.
outcome?   The numbing was the worse part (and that was hardly anything at all).   After that, i felt nothing.

The wire-localization may be painful, but with good anesthesia you may be able to feel very comfortable. In addition to local anesthesia they might opt to give you some sedative to help you relax. You will be a bit drowsy but it will make you feel better.

At that time had porta-catheter installed for chemotherapy.  Was hoping not to have to do chemo treatments but finding positive nodes makes chemo inevitable I guess. I don't know my treatment plan as of yet. Appt with rad. onc. on 4/11 and medical onc. is not until 4/18.  I am reading up on all of your posts regarding chemotherapy.  I am real scared!!

							Just wondering if this is common.

I had a tumor removed from my right lateral ventricle in October of last year and also had VP Shunt surgery in December due to complications of related to Hydrocephalus.

Following both surgeries, I was symptom free.  Prior to the tumor removal, I had four Petit Mal seizures which barely went noticed.  About a week ago, I had my first Grand Mal seizure.  Fortunately, I was at home and in bed but scrambled my brain for a couple of days.

Now, I know I've been told that seizures are somewhat common following brain surgery but six months out?  Anyone else experience this?

Of course, I've been restricted from driving and am back on the Dilantin until I see my Neurosurgeon on April 7th.  I've had both a CT scan and MRI and they came back normal.

I had a tumor removed this past March (neurocytoma) and then had to have 3 surgeries afterwards that eventually resulted in having to have a shunt ""installed"". 2 days ago, I was at work when, apparently, I had a grand mal seizure. I am terrified now. I don't want to have one again, of course. But what about driving???
My neuro repremanded me because he was convinced that this was a result of not taking my medicaion (I am on 330 mg of Dilantin/day), but I swear on my LIFE I have not missed a dose since being on it. 
I don't know what to do.

							That was a while ago. I've since changed meds (to Topamax 100 mg, 2x/ day), as well as changed my neurologist. So far so good on the Topamax, no side effects except weight loss and less of an appetite, but I had gained weight in the hospital, so I am not complaining at all!

							PS - Couldn't drive for 3 months, but got the OK from my new neuro thiswas Dec 17. If there are days that I am feeling under the weather at all though (headache, dizzy, etc), I use my judgement and either get a ride into work or just stay home if I really don't feel well (very rare though).

							My father was just diagnosed w/ lung cancer stage IV.  He is a fighter and knows that he is beginning the fight of his life...literally.  He has been told that he could only have less then a year to live.  He is a marathoner, a business owner, and a full time father to me (and I am 26 years old), and a husband.  He does a wonderful job at all of his roles.  
I am concerned w/ a cough he has.  He does not smoke.  Has not smoked in 30 years.  He is 56.  
He can not even walk around his yard w/ out getting a coughing fit.   The doctors have given him cough medicine and it doesn't help.  He has his lungs drained every other day through a catheter they gave him last wk.  
Does anyone know how to take care of his cough, or whether this is one of those things he will need to deal w/ because of the cancer.  The doctor told him to resume his normal activity, except he can't w/ this cough!

							I had a heart attack back in November 2004 and was taken into hospital for this reason, while there I was told I also have contracted non small cell cancer and have been given about 1 year to 18 months to live....About your fathers cough, I have been given methadone to treat my cough, which it does very effectively. Methadone is commonly used as a heroin substitute and I have to admit I was a little more than surprised when I was first offered this. However, it does work very well.

I've been looking at this site for a little while now, for me it has been difficult to discuss this with strangers, but sometimes late at night, like tonight one can feel very isolated. 

I'm very lucky to have an extended family, a wife that could not be more supportive and helpful, she's also a nurse which helps her maintain the mountain of meds and can give me any anti sickness shots I may need when under going my chemo. 

Being told you have a terminal illness effects different people different ways, I was told by a young Dr. that could not have been any more caring, in fact  felt very sorry for him, and like many people my first thoughts were of my wife, family and friends.....

In some ways I'm quite fortunate at the moment, I'm still mobile, can drive and on good days can ride my motor bike, but I am getting weaker and this mobility won't last much longer. Being mobile, whether that be walking or driving is important, so I hope this advice helps.

							Hello

Thanks to both for posting. Certainly a good part of our care is about managins symptoms, such as cough. Especially for patients whose cancer can no longer be cured, the emphasis is on comfort and control of symptoms. Cough can be simple to most people, but for you it is really a limitation. Opioids are medications that can be quite effective to treat cough. From what you've written it sounds like you have pleural effusions (fluid around the lungs)... that can irritate the diaphragm (the breathing muscle below your lungs) and cause cough. Please visit with your doctor and tell him how debilitating this cough has been to you.

							SLS
I had a cough for 6 months before I was diagnosed with lung cancer, after a month and a half of chemo my left leg started swelling, I was hospitalized for a DVT (blood clot), then at that time they gave me a CT scan to check for clots in my lungs and they found them.  I was put on Lovenox injections to thin my blood and the coughing stopped with in a week and I could sleep in bed again, before that I could only sleep in a lounge chair.  So apparently the clots don't show up on just any CT scan, they have to know what they are looking for.  My previous doctors said I could not have lung cancer because I never smoked.  So doctors get on a track stay on that track until something else happens.  I guess that only 10 to 15% of cancer patients get blood clots, unless something bad happens they wont think of blood clots causing anything.  Previously I had pills for a cough and about 4 bottles of cough syrup and non of it worked.  Lovenox is very expensive but it does the job and is better for cancer patients than coumadin.  I hope you get to the bottom of the problem with your fathers cough.  God Bless

							whould you please tell me about tomur suppressore?
thank you
						

"
"


							A tumor suppressor gene is a gene that reduces the probability that a cell in a multicellular organism will turn into a tumor cell. A mutation or deletion of such a gene will increase the probability of a tumor. In that way, a tumor suppressor gene is similar to an oncogene.

Tumor suppressor genes, or more precisely, the proteins they code for, either have a dampening or repressive effect on the regulation of the cell cycle or promote apoptosis, and sometimes do both. The functions of tumor suppressor proteins fall into several categories [1]  ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entre..._uids=14744434 ) including:

   1. Repression of genes that are essential for the continuing of the cell cycle. If these genes are not expressed, the cell cycle will not continue, effectively inhibiting cell division.
   2. Coupling the cell cycle to DNA damage. As long as there is damaged DNA in the cell, it should not divide. If the damage can be repaired, the cell cycle can continue.
   3. If the damage can not be repaired, the cell should initiate apoptosis, the programmed cell death, to remove the threat it poses for the greater good of the organism.
   4. Some proteins involved in cell adhesion prevent tumor cells from dispersing, block loss of contact inhibition, and inhibit metastasis [2]  ( http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov:80/entre..._uids=12841864 )

The first tumor suppressor protein discovered was the pRb protein in human retinoblastoma; however, recent evidence has also implicated pRb as a tumor survival factor. Another important tumor suppressor is the p53 gene.

							I am 30 years old...two years ago, I was diagnosed with a liver tumor which they assumed was focal nodular hyperplasia. I have had some pain around the liver area (upper right area) off and on, occasional 'jabs', etc. but never thought anything of it.

Last August, I started to have constant stabbing pains around the liver area. In Sept it escalated and I had to go to the ER. On 9/2/2004 they ran bloodwork, found I had elevated lipase which indicates pancreatitis, but the next day it came back normal (although other bloodwork elements were very high or low). The pain began to radiate to the upper abdominal area, I lost 14 pounds in 3 weeks, I couldn't eat, I was exhausted (although I have had problems with fatigue for a couple of years now). It went on through October. They've done MRIs, endoscopy, CAT scan, etc. and all came back 'normal'.

A couple of months went by, other than extreme fatigue (I would go to bed at 6pm, sleep until 6am to go to work...that is not like me) and occasional abdominal pain, things went back to 'normal'. But three weeks ago it's started again. Feeling incredibly swollen, sharp stabbing pains on the right upper side, a 'rock like' feeling into the middle of my stomach/abdomen area, difficulty eating, some weight loss, slight fever, etc. Again, bloodwork done, I had a hida scan done, all things coming back 'normal'. 

So, my doctor called me and said he was going to refer me to someone...and if his office calls to please just go along with the plan. He didn't specify what plan..or what kind of doctor I was going to be sent to.

The next day his office called - I am seeing a doctor in Boston, MA. Again, they didn't tell me why, who he is, etc. So I looked online - the doctor I am going to see is a specialist with liver oncology/surgery/etc.

So now I am feeling very scared. I am alone up here, my family is in Ohio, and I'm not sure what to do. I've been in constant pain for 3 weeks again, and I've also had some problems with going to the bathroom (bleeding). 

Can someone please give me their input or provide some insight? The fact I'm having these symptoms and that it's been recurring has me very worried now.

Thanks,

							What happens to irradiated areas on the skin? Does it leave a burn? If so, how long does the surface damage last and must it be covered?
						

"
"


							Unfortunately, radiation treatment can vary widely enough to make a definitive answer difficult.  In my case, the radiation was high energy photons (i.e.  x-rays), and what happens varies with the individual.

First - I didn't feel a thing.  The machine (a Varian Cliniac 2100C) was loud, but the radiation was painless.

Second - on me it left no marks, although the literature stated that I might develop a brown tint in the irradiated area.  I was told that if it changed color, that it might always stay that way.  So I got off lucky.

Third - the area is permanently changed.  No hair gorws there any more, nor as I understand it, ever will again.   But then again, since the area irradiated was my stomach area, front, sides, and back, it doesn't show so anyone would notice.

Fourth - yes I must keep it covered, because the area is very sensitive to sunlight. 

May your treatments go as well as mine did.

							Ralph,

Thanks for posting. Radiation therapy can cause a variety of skin changes, that range from mild to severe. It not only depends on the dose of radiation received, but also on the individual. Radiation changes are usually not reversible, and there are cases where some sort of surgery might be involved. The problem is that not only the skin is damaged, but also the tissues beneath it are also affected, so skin grafts might not be as effective as if normal tissues were there.

							I have completed 4 AC and 4 Taxol.  It has been a month since my last dose of Taxol and  the neuropathy has gotten worse. Has anyone else had this experience? I thought I was losing my mind.  How could it possibly get worse after all this time.  However, my oncologist said this can happen.  It is like sripping the bark off a tree.  Bark grows slowly and it may take 6-12 months for my nerves to return to normal.  At first it was numb, but then became very sensitive to touch as in painful.  I have it in my hands and feet.  It affects both sensory and motor nerves.  I have to be careful walking so as not to trip.  

It is so hard to be patient.  It is good that I just recently retired as this would keep me from working as a nurse.  I am doing acupuncture which seems to help some.  I hope that the Taxol knocked the socks off of any remaning cancer cells as it did my nerve cells.  

So I am now on to having 33 treatments of radiation and that is going well.  What a journey....Sharon

							Neuropathy, a problem that sometimes occurs with chemotherapy treatment. It's not all that rare, especially frequent in patients older than 65 years of age. It is damage to the nerves. It can occur from some chemotherapy drugs used in conventional cancer treatment.

There are three major goups of nerves in the human body, the peripheral nerves that carry information to and from the limbs, the nerves that supply the bowels and other internal organs, and the nerves of the head which connect to the ears, eyes, taste buds, etc. Nerves in any or all of these major groups can be affected by certain chemotherapy drugs.

Nerves are vulnerable to many kinds of damage. They can be damaged by certain cancers. This may be caused by the cancer cells producing a particular kind of biological agent that interferes with the function of the nerves. Sometimes, they can be damged by drugs used in chemotherapy treatment. The chemotherapy drugs that most likely cause nerve damage are the vinca alkaloids(vincristine, vindesine and vinblastine), platinum drugs(cisplatinum, carboplatinum) and the taxanes(taxol, taxotere). These drugs have the potential of interfering with nerve function.

You may notice symptoms in different areas of your body depending on which groups of nerves are affected. Symptoms in the hands and feet happen when peripheral nerve damage happens and are not rare with vinca alkaloids. The first sign of nerve damage is usually a feeling of tingling and numbness like what you experience when your foot goes to sleep after you've been sitting for a long time in an uncomfortable position. If the problem progresses further, it often produces weakness of the muscles, resulting in loss of strength at the wrist or the ankle. You will notice difficulty in doing up buttons and picking up coins. You may notice that you will tend to trip while walking up stairs or dragging your feet and tend to have a wide-based gait. In severe cases, the weakness may be so severe that you will need a wheelchair.

When the nerves in the bowel are affected, constipation is the earliest sign. In a few people, the abdomen becomes bloated with a distended bowel that is basically paralyzed. Some of the nerves in the head can also be affected. Platinum drugs can affect the auditory nerve and cause loss of hearing and tinnitus(ringing in the ears). Vision can very occasionally be affected.

A lot depends on how quickly your cancer treatment can be stopped. Sometimes the need for treatment is more urgent then the residual nerve damage. Sometimes, the balance between benefit from the drug and the side effect of nerve damage is more finely balanced.

Once treatment has been stopped, recovery is usually slow. It may take months to get even partial improvement and often there will be some residual impairment, either a motor weakness or a sensory numbness or both. Recovery is slower in the feet and legs than in the hands and arms.

There is no specific treatment that enhances nerve recovery. There are no drugs that will directly stimulate nerve regeneration or recovery. If you have severe and prolonged pain, then the pain may require narcotics often combined with antidepressants. In some cases, certain types of anticonvulsants would be helpful. Treatment options are subjects that you should discuss with your doctor, so you have accurate expectations of potential benefits and side effects.

Chemotherapy drugs that can cause neuropathy. NCI lists these as most likely to do so:

Cisplatinum (Platinol)

Carboplatin (Paraplatin)

Vincristine (Oncovin)

Vinblastine (Velban)

Etoposide/VP-16 (VePesid)

Cytarabine (Cytosar, Ara-C)

Hexamethylmelamine (Hexalen)

Suramin

Paclitaxel (Taxol) and Docetaxel (Taxotere)

Other medications reported to contribute to neuropathy include oxaliplatin (Eloxatin), gemcitibine (Gemzar) and thalidomide (Thalomid).

Bionumerik, in boosting its new drug Tavocept, that is aimed at preventing or reducing common and serious side effects, particularly nerve and kidney damage, associated with taxane (Taxol) and platinum (Carboplatin) drugs, talks about in their literature that chemotherapy-induced toxicities are common and serious clinical problems that adversely impact both the quality of life of cancer patients and the ability of patients to continue treatment for their cancer.
						

"
"


							Thank you all for the excellent information and suggestions.  I think that neuropathy is really played down by the oncologists.  They are reluctant to change any dosing probably in fear of reducing the effectiveness of Taxol.  However,  I think that it needs to be addressed in a more serious manner as it has a direct impact on the quality of life.  The fear of it being permanent is huge.  I actually called Bristol Myers Squibb and talked to the oncoology and hematology division.  Unfortantely, I knew more than the person I spoke with.  I did access their web site and read the product information sheet.  Older patients do recover more slowly from neuropathy.  I was told by the oncologist that it may take 6 months to a year for my feeling to return.  Micheal, did you mean L-Glutamine or glucosamine for relief? I did take 30 GM of L-Glutamine for five days after each Taxol.  Appartently Melissa Etheridge stopped the Taxol when she expereinced numbness...you can't play the guitar with numb fingers.
  I am now taking 300 mg of Neurotin three times a day.  It does help.  60% of patients on Taxol experience some neuropathy.  I am very cautious when walking so as not to trip and fall.  I wear very supportive and protective shoes as well.  
Interestingly, the numbness in my upper lip is gone and I have normal function and feeling in my face now.  I don't know if it is my imagination or not, but I have a strange sensation on my back.  It feels like I just put moisturizer on my back when my clothes touch it.....like it would feel if you put a tee shirt on after swimming and were slightly wet.  I quess we all respond a bit differently, but neuropathy is a huge issue for me.
Hugs, Sharon

							A new study from the Research on Adverse Drug Events and Reports (RADAR) pharmacovigilance program at Northwestern University Feinberg School of Medicine identified 287 unique cases of hypersensitivity reactions submitted to the FDA's Adverse Event Report System between 1997 and 2007 with 109 (38 percent) deaths in patients who received Cremophor-based paclitaxel, a solvent-administered taxane chemotherapy. 

Adverse event reports generally only represent from 1 to 10 percent of actual incidence, so the number of hypersensitivity reactions and deaths is likely significantly higher. The severe allergic reactions are believed to be caused by Cremophor, the chemical solvent - a derivative of castor oil -- that is used to dissolve some insoluble drugs before they can be injected into the blood stream.

							A number of people have asked me about my perceptions of the recent clinical trial I participated in. 

The testosterone clinical trial is not entirely over although it is closed to new participants, having filled its number of candidates long before expected. The coordinators were very helpful in doing whatever they could to help me participate by distance after the initial on-site physical exam and labs. The trial was 2 months in length, with each participant getting 1 jar of cream each month and not knowing which was the placebo and which had the testosterone in it, and then the next month reversing the creams. The cream was 2% testosterone and we were to use 1/8 teaspoon daily on the skin of the stomach or the thighs (fatty areas absorb in the best way). The only unpleasant aspect was that one had to put it on and then wait 5 minutes while it absorbed, which was a bit tiresome since all I wanted to do most of the time was hit the sack to sleep... 

The first 2 days were a bit problematic in that the small spoon that I received was the wrong size but I wasn't sure until the third day. For whatever reason, I had 3 straight nights with a bad headache and wondered if that meant I was then getting the testosterone cream. It also seemed to me that the perineal area felt uncomfortably sensitive although I didn't feel any more libido. My husband and I started the clinical trial at the same time as a 2-week vacation so our mood was happy and we were at play. 

Once a week a 1-page form with questions about various aspects had to be filled out. No, I didn't grow any more hair anywhere, or develop acne, or a deeper voice during the entire 8 weeks. At the end of each month a more detailed questionnaire had to be filled out. I also had to have lab tests periodically and send them in, so they would be able to terminate my participation if any lab came up out of range. 

At the beginning of the first week of the second month I was surprised to suddenly find myself very depressed for the first 2 days. I wondered if that meant I had been on testosterone during the first month, and was coming off of it as I went into the second month and the second jar of cream. The depression ended without any problems and in fact I felt somewhat better in terms of mood for the rest of the second month than I had during the first one. At the end of the 8 weeks I filled out the last detailed form and sent it in, with my written guess that because of the sharp headache at the beginning when I accidentally started out with the wrong size spoon and dose, and because of the sudden depression at the start of the second month, I thought maybe I had been on testosterone the first month of the trial. 

Not so. It turns out that the month that I was feeling the best was the month I was on the testosterone. At the end of the trial we were told that if we desired to continue to use the cream we would need to get a local provider to prescribe it, and that if we agreed then we would be contacted at the end of 6 months to provide any additional information. I don't know how many women decided to continue, but I did. It took some time to get the appointment with a local provider to get the prescription, but with the paperwork provided by the clinical trial, the cream was provided by our local small-town pharmacy without any problem. As a participant during the remaining months I am required to have blood draws every 3 months to be sure my hormonal levels remain postmenopausal. I am only a short way into the extended period now and actually I think it helps most in terms of general mood and greater energy, which then contributes to a more loving environment in general. I have no information about the results of the clinical trial pertaining to ALL of the women who participated, so this commentary on it is just my personal perspective. If and of you are interested (including doctors), I will let you know at the end what I find out and what my experience with the entire process is.

							Hi Alaska...
What an interesting study, how did you manage to hook up with that study?  I am glad that the cream gave you some success.  I agree that just having better moods and more energy makes for better living in general.   Did you talk to your onc before you went on the study?  I am PR/ER + and I worry about these types of things.  But, I will also say that I am suffering now in the libedo department!  My energy levels are good, I weightlift and doing cardio almost everyday, but I do notice at night I crash pretty fast, but its usually a good kind of tired.  
I wonder if my libedo problem stems from the flip flopping with my period  and my pre-menopausal status.  In Feb my GYN ran the blood test again, and it came back pre-menopausal.  I pretty much thought I was considered post-menopausal after not having my period for over 15 months.  Then out the clear blue sky, it returned for three months every 21 days like clock work.  Now its been4 months again since I have had a period...So I am wondering if this could contribute to the libedo problem????  My husband has been patient and understanding, but it is starting to make me crazy!!  
At first I didn't want to try any treatments, but I am wondering about this cream???

							Hi Dr. Leo and Kristen,

Kristen thanks for your question. At diagnosis I wanted immediately to be part of a clinical trial, if I could find any that I felt were asking questions that were meaningful to me and that I would qualify for. I was too confused at time of diagnosis to effectively find a clinical trial for me.

Later I found the national website (ClinicalTrials.gov). I searched for any trial dealing with libido. Because of my family history I eventually got into The Early Detection for Ovarian Cancer clinical trial (and I am still in that trial, which lasts several years). But I kept watching the website for a trial dealing with libido, and last year found it. It wasn't open for a long time, but I dogged it and the day it opened I was on the phone calling. It wasn't simple. None of the locations offering the trial were near me; the closest were either Hawaii or Arizona. I had to find the money to get there and I had to pay for the physical exam and initial lab. I didn't know for sure that my labs would allow me to qualify even on the plane ride down there. Life is sometimes a gamble and I'm not really much of a gambler. But I want very much for answers to the question of post-treatment loss of libido to be worked on, instead of just being part of the problem and feeling that nobody cares as long as we are fortunate enough to be alive. I also think that some of the best answers to breast cancer will probably be found through a more thorough understanding of hormones. As with most things we don't know about, there are possible risks. 

Like Leo I know it will be years yet before something is available. There are always conflicting interests in wider spheres than the realm of bc survivors when it comes to a clinical trial like this and any results.

A few other comments:

The short answer to the question ""Did testosterone help with libido?"" the answer is yes.

1.	Before participating in the clinical trial, I found that a number of women in online discussions who had experience using testosterone mentioned that it took quite a while before they experienced good effect. The 4 weeks of the clinical trial may not be long enough to demonstrate the effect accurately either way.

2.	In the late 1990's there was program on Oprah on national TV where a general group of postmenopausal women who had used the testosterone cream were explaining how helpful they had found it to be. A major difference between their use and the use in the clinical trial was that those women were using it directly on the perineal area/clitoris, whereas the clinical trial required it to be applied to the stomach and upper thighs.

3.	Another difference between the effects experienced by each of the 2 groups would be that a high percentage of the group of bc survivors would likely have had a more complete transition to menopausal hormonal levels due to having had chemotherapy.

4.	Another difference between the effects experienced by each of the 2 groups would be that many of the bc survivors would likely have at some time been on (and probably still are on) medication affecting hormonal levels throughout the clinical trial, such as letrozole, anastrozole, etc. in addition to having had chemotherapy.

5.	Another difference in effect for some of the women in the trial may be due to which method they were using as a lubricant, and whether it included any estrogen.

So?.

Prior to starting the trial I had spent 1 3/4 years on tamoxifen and then had not been on any hormonal suppressant medication for a long period of time. At the end of the clinical trial it was the general mood and energy that are a legitimate component of libido that had improved for me. 

In addition, for some time prior to the clinical trial and during the clinical trial, I was using the E-string, which dispenses a minute amount of estrogen directly to the vaginal area. Prior to the clinical trial I found that it helped somewhat but that intercourse was still quite uncomfortable and very mechanical.

What I didn?t know at the time that the 8 weeks of the clinical trial ended but since have discovered is that intercourse is now a lot less painful--even during a break from the testosterone while I was in the process of getting it prescribed in my home town. I am still using the E-string. I do not know if the testosterone ""triggered"" this improvement, or what. If it did, maybe I don't even need to continue the testosterone.

There still is no sexual response to breast stimulation in either breast. (I am a left lumpectomee, hanging off the edge of Stage 1.) I do feel that the increased interest I have in the physical expression of intimacy and passion is very worthwhile. No, it isn't exactly like being in the back seat of a Chevy as a teenager, but is much better for me from how I felt prior to participating in the clinical trial.

I am interested in trying an aromatase inhibitor to see what affect (if any) that may have.

							The results of the 2004 NCI study about this are available. As one of the 150 chosen to participate in this trial in 2004, I have some comments about it. 

The trial was done to see if use of testosterone by breast cancer survivors would help with libido, AND to see what hormonal changes took place. 

The conclusions reached were that testosterone supplementation does not help with libido AND that testosterone supplementation does NOT increase the blood levels of estradiol.

This information I think is important. Breast cancer survivors have been leery of using testosterone supplementation because the medical community believed that testosterone would break down into estradiol. So from this trial it appears clear that it does not.

One might ask what is the point, since it doesn't seem to help with libido? But I would be cautious about accepting that it does not help. Testosterone supplementation alone may not help; but this trial did not answer the question as to whether using it by balancing it with other hormones would help. As mentioned in the trial results, perhaps libido requires some amount of supplementation with estrogen. However, it also may be true that restoring libido requires some amount of testosterone as well to provide a needed balance, or it might require a balance of testosterone with other hormones such as progesterone, or even melatonin or insulin or ? So as a participant in the trial I do not accept that testosterone is ""not useful in this group"". The fact that use of testosterone did NOT increase the levels of estradiol is quite significant to ME.

A second point is that the trial required that the testosterone cream not be applied in the genital area. My understanding from general discussion among women who found testosterone supplementation quite useful was that they were applying it to the clitoris. 

If you want to see the study results, they can be found in ASCO 2006, Abstract 8507.

							Hi  I finished dose/dense A/C chemo on Feb. 15 (everyone that is just starting it is not so bad goes by fast you want to talk email me)and now I am on my third week of radiation  35 in all.  My oncologist did not believe in vitamins or supplements so I started juicing and ate real good . My radiologist suggest a womans one a day. My concern is that I am not taking in enough calcium. I just turned 50 the chemo put me in menopause and I believe that depletes your calcium. I do have a cup of yogurt and milk in cereal or at times I have a glass and eat cheese.  Also I do eat healthy but do you get all the vitamins you need from food. My reiki master  who is also a holistic nurse, does not believe we do unless you get fresh veggies everyday from garden which at this time of year is not possible. PS. Reiki is wonderful, made a huge difference for me going thru chemo. Any suggestions would be appreciated.

							Susan,

Thanks for joining our community here. I do believe that patients should be on a multivitamin a day. In addition, postmenopausal women or those at high risk for osteoporosis should be taking calcium supplements as well. Of course if you can get fruits and vegetables in they are an excellent source of vitamins.

Also went in to have moles checked to have off last week do not want anything that could lead to cancer on my body.Most are scheduled to come off the end of month but one was questionable and  I am again going to a cancer specialist to have ck today.  I am trying to look at this as good b/c it is one on my arm that to me looked normal but was a bit raised.  Quick question wouldnt the chemo affect that also?  Just hard to be seeing the end in site too have to think about this now.  Thanks again for the reply.

							Hi Susan,
I was on the same treatment as you.  I have just reached my two year dx date.  
I am not a vitamin expert by any stretch of the means, but I think by eating a balanced diet you can get most of what you need.  However, like your doctor, mine also recomended a womens mulit vitamin and like doctor Leo mentions also extra calcium.  I think the recomended dose is 1200 units.  I think my multi vit has 250 and I take a calcium with D (make sure you take one that says calcium with D) and they are 600 units.  You can take two calcium tablets a day, but take them at different times.  I only take one additional right now because I drink a lot of milk and eat a lot of diary products (also I am not post menopausal...(43) or so the blood test say...   )
Again, there are a lot of people that take a lot of different suppliments for a variety of reasons.  I only take a multi and extra calcium and try to eat a balanced diet.
Good luck in finishing up your rads....its so very nice to have a light at the end of the tunnel!!!
						

"
"


							Like Kristin says, extra calcium is generally recommended in particular for those who have had chemo, taking it in several doses spread apart. We all start losing bone density around age 35 anyhow. I was recommended to take 1500 mg a day even though my bone density test came out very well. By the way, if you happen to be a salt-aholic like me, you should understand that enjoying that extra salt also causes you to lose calcium.  

*sigh* What will I have to give up NEXT....!!!

							Hi Kristen and AtlaskaAngel,  Thanks for the advise at least I now have  an idea on what to shoot for. I just felt I needed more than one a day. I do drink milk, eat yogurt and cheese, so I will probably start with 600 w/d,  I just came home from a healing drum circle (vibrational energy). I had alot of fun pounding on that drum , chanting and dancing. You have to try it sometime it was not what I expected.  Alot of positive, strong, energy.  I know  what you mean about the light at the end of the tunnel, I am  excited now that my eyelashes are growing back, funny that I didnt miss them when they were gone. It has been 7 weeks since my last chemo my hair seems to be taking its time alot of peach fuzz. does any one know how long it does take to grow back? Thanks for the advice and support . love and hugs

							Hi Susan!

My last chemo was 4/29/04.  I'd heard it takes about 6 months to get back to a normal short hairstyle, and that seems about what it was for me.  I had a wig that looks much like my normal hair, so continued to wear it longer than I would have had to, but my daughter's wedding was Sept 25, '04, and wanted to look more like my normal self in the pictures than the really short ""athletic-type"" hair that I had at that point.  The Monday after the wedding I took off the wig for good!  I was just really happy to be feeling like my old self for the wedding--a weekend long event on Mackinac Island, MI--which was planned well before my diagnosis!  It  was like a fairy tale.  Best wishes to you as you return to a more ""normal"" (if there is such a thing!) life style.

							Hi again Susan,

You mention that you will be taking the multi and extra calcium and that you are post menopausal.....Are you ER/PR + and on Arimidex, or even Tamoxifen???
I ask because I think the recomended dose for any post menopausal women is approx 1200 to 1500 units of a calcium with D suppliment to keep the bones healthy after menopause.  If you are ER/PR + and on Arimidex, this is known to have adverse effects on the bones, therefore extra calcium is a must.  If you are on tamoxifen, this is known to actually not have adverse effects on the bones.  Either way though, you may want to increase your calcium with D to 1200 units simply because you are post menopausal....Ask your OBGYN and see what they say.

About the hair.... my chemo ended 9/03 and by 12/03 I was hatless..very short and curly but enough to be comfortable to not wear anything.  I can wear my hair very short and it looks good.  My hair grew back really fast and curly and a different color...EEK!! (grayish)...However, I kept cuitting it and eventually the curly totally came out and my original color...blondish brown also came back.  I was very surprised how fast my hair came back.  I have kept it short and now get it highlighted to get some added life to to it..LOL..

							is it chemo or radiation that causes hair loss? How quickly will it return? Is it true that the eyelashes don't return for much longer than other hair?
						

"
"


							Hello Ralph,
Both chemo and radiation can cause hair loss.
Radiation, at least for me, caused the hair loss in the local area of the actual radiation. Which for me was both a good thing and a bad thing, since my radiation was high up on my chest, it removed all of that unsightly back hair, which was good. Unfortunatley it also removed a square shaped patch of chest hair, which just looks weird. But that is starting to come back. I had 30 treatment during October and November, and it is finally starting to come back.
For me the chemo hair loss was more widespread. I thought the worst part of that was losing my eyebrows and eyelashes, as well as my nasal hair. My nose was constantly running, and I looked like a thumb. I thought about drawing in my eyebrows, but then I always looked either surprised or angry, so that idea was out. Aside from the looks I needed to use eyedrops to help keep my eyes from stinging. It does come back, I would say within 2-3 months after I ended my main series of treatments I had regrown most of my hair. I am currently in maintenence chemo right now and I am suffering a but of hair loss, but nothing like when I had major chemo.
I would also suggest shaving your head before the chemo starts making you hair fall out. I just didn't want to have to vacuum the bed every morning.
Good luck with your treatment, and remember, loss of hair is nothing. Look at Burt Reynolds, been bald for years and it doesn't seem to bother him.

							hiya
I had really long, long thick hair which was my pride and joy.
It started to fall out 2 weeks after my chemo (my chemo was pretty intense).
It was on my bed, my clothes, kitchen floor and so on...... So eventually I asked my boyfriend to chop it off and then shave it, after that it was like a weight had been lifted from my shoulders, don't get me wrong, i hated losing it but so far i haven't lost my eyebrows or eyelashes and i am away to start my third chemo
good luck to you

							For me it's mainly the chemo. If I can remember, in 02 I had radiation and it didn't really effect my hair or eyebrows. Early of 05 I had 4 cycles of strong chemo then n april of 05 I had high dose chemo. Eventhough my hair fell off, hwoever the good thing was that my eyebrows were still intact, probably because of the 4 cycles of chemo prior.
						

"
"


							Different types of chemo, and even different doses/schedules of the same chemo, can cause very different degrees of hairloss...My wife Lori lost all of her hair when she was on Taxol, Cisplatin & Etoposide, as this is a very heavy regiment, but 8 months later she switched to Gemzar, which is rather mild, and her hair grew back fast; both thick and beautiful, including her eyebrows and lashes! When she was switched to Taxotere she lost all of her hair again, and now that she's on Taxol, her hair's growing back again, apparently because of the schedule (once a week instead of once every three weeks) but this time her hair is quite fine, almost like a baby's, and her eyebrows are pretty much no existent, for the time being anyway!

Hope this helps,
Good Luck

							Hi Everyone,

Thanks for replying to my post. 

The face pain has gone now, Thank God! I was scared stiff that it might have been an allergic reaction to the Taxol. Been on a bit of an emotional and physical rollercoaster since December, still find it hard to believe this is really happening to me. Am amazed I've coped with it so far as I consider myself a really bad patient! Some days it feels like there's gonna be no end to it so viewing the forum and seeing how many others have now completed treatment and are still going strong really helps keep the spirit up and helps me look forward. I know I'll still have dark days but hopefully less of them

							Hey everybody.  My mom had her mast. tuesday and we came home today.  The doctors said everything went perfect, the mast. and the reconstruction.  She's in a lot of pain though.  It's bearable though.  She had a lymph node biopsy last thursday, they removed 2 lymph nodes.  They got back the path report and one of the lymph nodes they took out had a tumor on it, but fortunately it was less than a millimeter in size.  They went on ahead while they were doing the mast. and reconstruction and took out all of the lymph nodes.  We will find out about the results April 6th.  the oncologist told us depending on how many lymph nodes were affected will determine the stage of cancer. We are hoping and praying for positive news.  I will put an update after the 6th to let everyone know the news.

Your skin lesion could be something very simple, but honestly you need to be seen if you have a changing mole or something that is unusual. The chances of cancer are lower for younger people, but that does not mean that young people don't get cancer.

							Hello, I am new and go by is copay, since all i have done is payed copays for the past year and a half.. Who invented this, heck my wife has caught on and no requiring a copay..

Now for my problem.. I have breast cancer, invasive carcinoma... i am estrogen pos and her2 neg..I had stage 3 b, and my lymph nodes in my neck had swollen and a biopsey to them showed breast cancer.

i had a modified radical mast, removal of 30 nodes, and all were pos. except one. my first pet scan after mast show some activity to my neck, a small area in brest (which they said may be infection) and a small place on 1st right rib.

i started chemo with a/c and after 3 of 4 rounds my nodes were shrinking and then after forth i went to taxol. After 1st taxol, another PET showed very little activity and that i was responding well. I was only able to do 3 rounds of taxol due to severe muscle problems but my onc said the last was not needed and would not make a difference. I was put on Aremidex then

I then had 33 rads to chest and neck area and was told they hit me very hard. I did great through everything, took a lot of supplements andnever misssed work, etc.

I was to have a PET after 90 days from completion of my radss which I did. I WAS SHATTERED at results.. The pet has shown that the cancer is in C7 and T! and l# of my spine (which explains the arm and neck pain I have had about a month... It also showed a spot on my hip and a small 9mm node in my left armpit area.

My onc has started me on hormone therpy and taken me off aremidex..He has put me on Faslodex and also zometa every four weeks and sent me to my rad onc who has said he needs to do some ""spot welding"" and will be starting that this week.

Why when I was clear did this show up after rads and not show up befor.?Should I not now also be back on chemo? My onc says lets see how hormone therepy does and we may need to do another type chemo down the road.

I trust my doctors however is this common to come back this quick? Do I need anything else? I never worried when I was first told and never feared anything...This news now has crushed me and has me worried, and my arm pain and neck pain worry me.


Please help and any advise. I am considering another opinion but am with some top doctors in the state of florida... Just confused....

							Hello

Thanks for posting. I understand these are very difficult times for you. It is possible that you have very aggressive disease, that appears to have progressed despite radiation. I can not tell you whether you should get chemotherapy and/or radiation at this point, but what I can tell you is that it seems like your oncology has some options for you down the road. It is always important to evaluate whether one form of treatment is working before moving on to the next alternative.

I frequently mention that patients can always seek second opinions. Even if you are happy with you current oncologist, you might want to check if there are other thoughts. Despite multiple protocols and guidelines, cancer treatment is not carved in stone, and different oncologists may make different choices when choosing treatments.

My mother was diagnosed with cholangiocarcinoma. She has tried two forms of chemo and the dr. just told her that (the dr.) doesn't have any other options. Though when my mother was diagnosed the dr. seemed like there were options, not to give up. I am now researching clinical trials for her. If anyone has any suggestions for our family we would be greatly appreciated. This is a very difficult time and the more information we can get and learn would be very helpful. 


"
"


							I'm sorry to hear of the diagnosis and failed treatment.

I was also diagnosed with cholangeocarcinoma last year, and chose the surgical treatment as the best option.  The surgeon (Dr. Selwyn Vickers - highly recommended) performed a Whipple procedure, where they removed the gall bladder, the head of the pancreas, part of the stomach, about a foot of intestine, and every lymph node they could reach.  They reattached things differently when they were done.  It took six hours on the table, and seven days in the hospital.  The surgery was successful, and the head pathologist at UAB Hospital said that it looked like they got it all, although there is never perfect assurance of that.

That was followed by six weeks, five days a week, of radiation of the affected area, and chemotherapy at the same time (using Xeloda), and then after four weeks off, two more courses of Xeloda by itself.  I am a week from the end of the last round of chemo.  The CT scan last week showed no signs of anything returning, so that is good news.

My point is that there are several ways to treat this, and that you need to investigate the other options.  Surgery is probably an option, and one worth asking about.  The Whipple procedure is so complicated that I would recommend that if you go that way, to make sure that the surgeon is experienced in this.  I can honestly recommend both the hospital (UAB Hospital in Birmingham, Alabama) and the team headed by Dr. Vickers, although there are several wonderful cancer centers spread around the country.  

Get a reference to a major cancer center near you and go.

							I am not the person to provide all of the options for you.  There are doctors who specialize in this sort of thing, and I would recommend finding one.  I am quite serious about getting a referral to a major cancer center and going there.  Because this is hard to treat, you need to find the best team you can to deal with it.  

Now, I must say this:  As I understand it, cholangeocarcinoma can quickly develop into pancreatic cancer, for which the expected lifetime is very short.  As such, do not delay to get this taken care of.

							Hello

Thanks for posting. Cholangiocarcinoma can be treated surgically if the disease is its initial stages. If the disease is more extensive, unfortunately surgery is no longer an option. Also, if the person if very debilitated, surgery carries a much higher risk.

In terms of chemotherapy, unfortunately there are not many options. I would agree that clinical trials could be the next step.

I am researching alternative treatments for my sister's cholangeocarcinoma, or liver cancer. She was diagnosed in April last year and was on the surgeon's table within two weeks having 30 percent of her liver removed. In December 2004, tests showed she was cancer free. But two weeks ago, she found out her cancer her cancer had returned. It is inoperable. She is pursuing conventional treatment - chemotherapy - with the best doctors in New York and Boston. I am in charge of researching possible alternative treatments that she can do in addition to chemo. She has three young children she plans to see reach adulthood so recovery is a must!

							There is a new treatment option available.  The drug is called DAVANAT and it is mixed with 5FU.  Before you move on - just listen.  5FU has got horrible side effects but when mixed with DAVANAT it has ZERO side effects.  The mfg is Pro Pharmaceticals.  You have to go to their website and look at the videos to understand.  There is a Phase II trial about to start but it looks like it will be super hard to get into the trial.  If you can get in and meet the requirements this is going to help.  We already know that 5FU kills cancer but the side effects are aweful.  With zero side effects what do you have to lose with trying the therapy.

By the way they have a 70% stabilization rate on stage III/IV patients.  Compare this to AVASTIN at 24%.  Just something to think about.  Dig through the website www.pro-pharmaceuticals.com

							I was diagnosed in 2004, a year after I had visited the doctor and told him I thought something was wrong.  When I was diagnosed they told me I was in Stage IV.  I went through chemotherapy from June of 2004 until Oct 2005.  I had Xeloda and ? (can't remember).  At first we had good results and the tumors shrunk..but it didn't last and the tumors started to grow again.  I was sent to UCLA to see if the tumors could be cut out and was first told they could do it.  Then that changed to ""no"".  And along the way I did have the 5FU and thought I was going to die!  It was pretty bad. I was sent to City of Hope to see about ablation.  They were scheduled to do and then my oncologist decided it was too risky.  Then in August of 2005 I was put on the transplant list.  The list at UCLA was very long and they thought I should go on a clinical trial while I waited.  However, there was a guardian angel dressed in ""coordinator's"" clothes who advised me to seek out another hospital with a shorter list.  I did just that and was transplanted in April, but before I was transplanted they injected chemo directly into the tumor through the artery.  So for everyone dealing with this disease I am here to tell you that miracles do happen.

							Since that last time I've posted there have been some advancements or not really advancements but things further along in the approval process.  DAVANAT approval looks to be a foregone conclusion.  They are meeting with the FDA to file their NDA to market the drug.  It is safe beyond all reasonable doubt.  This drug is the ""magic bullet"" for cancer.  It renders 5FU non toxic to our system.  

This chemo treatment you talk about right into the tumor makes a lot of sense.  I don't know why they didn't do that for people sooner.  I have also heard of an ultrasound that zaps the tumor.  It slightly raises the temperature of the cells and they are destroyed.  There is little collateral damage.  This treatment originated in China. 

So a lot more miracles are going to keep happening is my point.

							I have a few family members who have/had some sort of cancer.  I have a great aunt who is suffering from it and my mom pulled through some sort of neck cancer, and im really starting to get scared that I might have cancer as well.  For the past few years i have had tiny lumps appear every once in a while behind both ears, but i never thought much of it.  I few days ago a slightly larger lump formed at the back of my jaw, below my right ear, but it didnt get very big and didnt stay long, but several days ago and very big lump appeared under my right armpit and it is huge and hurts very badly.  For the past few days i have had trouble even showering and putting on deodorant because it hurts so bad to touch it, and it has progressivly grown slightly bigger day by day.  Ive told my mom about it but she wont take me to the doctor.. she just thinks its allergies and it will go away in a few days.

Is that a possibility or could this be cancer?  Im really gettin nervous about this.  On top of that i kno stress only makes diseases worse, but i suffer very very severly from social anxiety disorder as well (parents dont kno about it) so i naturally get easily stressed out of anything that could go wrong in any way.

							Hello Orionation,

You sound very scared.  It sounds to me that you are under the age of 18, is this so?  Both you and your mom need to stop doing home diagnosis.  You are worried and that needs to be addressed.  We are simply not equiped to play doctor.  An example might be that a headache can mean something life threatening or that we need glasses!  I do not know the relationship you have with your mom but, try to let her know (calmly) that because of family history you are scared and want to put your mind at ease.  Also, let her know that separate from that you have pain NOW and that needs to be looked into.

You can reach me here at any time,

							My Mother has just been diagnosed with rectal cancer and I am looking at surgical options for her. She saw a Doctor briefly today, he advised that because the cancer is close to the anus, she will need a colostomy bag permanently. She is more concerned about this than the diagnosis! The growth was too large to be removed at colonoscopy however, both an MRI and CAT scan show the growth is restricted to the bowel wall.

I have done a little research this afternoon, and understand that there is a surgery option that allows for the growth to be removed and then the colon connected to the anus to avoid the colostomy bag. Is this specialist surgery? Does anyone know where in England I can find out who carries out this surgery? She will pay for private surgery if necessary.

The doctor mentioned she may need Radiotherapy but he and other doctors are meeting at the Royal Marsden tomorrow to discuss the surgery and scans and will then come back to her. In the meantime, IF less invasive surgery is possible (I understand too that these tumours can be removed using a laporascope) I need to find out as soon as possible, as my own experiences with the NHS is that they dont necessarily explain all the opions to you, simply using the ones that are routinely performed.

Help please!

Thanks in advance.

Thanks for posting. Usually this type of surgery involves a colostomy, sometimes temporary, sometimes permanent. Also, at least with rectal cancer radiation is involved. Anal cancer is different, it is a completely different diagnosis. I understand that having a colostomy is not good news, but rectal cancer can be cured. Hopefully your mother can recover well and have a long life.

							Thank you Leo, but the news today was better. The Royal Marsden (UK London cancer hospital) had the case referred to them and a colorectal nurse called my Mother with a better outlook than the surgeon she saw yesterday. 

Basically, the cancer has affected both the anus and the rectum, making saving bowel function if relying on surgery very difficult indeed, but, strangely, (that?s me talking, it might be quite common), the anal cancer is squamous cell and the rectal is Adenocarcinoma. It appears to be confined to the bowel wall and has not spread anywhere else.



Next Wednesday, they will start both chemotherapy and Radiotherapy courses at The Marsden and will try to shrink both cancers. Apparently, the squamous cell responds very well to chemo and often having this combined therapy shrinks the tumours completely making surgery unnecessary. She will be scanned on a regular basis to monitor progress. If the tumours fail to respond to therapy or it does not shrink them completely, then obviously surgery will be the next step but hopefully it will improve surgical options at a minimum, plus I have located a hospital that carries out this sphincter saving surgery and they tell me there are several in the UK.

So, to sum up, the chances of surgery have diminished or at least been put on hold for now, and it was good news to me, as this fell in line with the hours of Internet research I did yesterday.

It is a pity the surgeon was not quite so helpful at the consultation, it would have saved a lot of stress.

I appreciate that when it comes to life and death, colostomy is not the end of the world, but it does concern me that newly diagnosed patients, many without acces to the Internet, are not necessarily having their disease process explained properly or perhaps not even being offered the best treatment options and in particular to this case, it should have been explained that a colostomy was the worse case scenario, not a given.

Thank you again Leo.

							Hi Angela - you really are in good hands with the Royal Marsden, but if you want a second opinion you might try St. Marks Hospital at Northwick Park, Watford Road, Harrow Middx, Tel: 0181 235 4046 - it is the only committed gastroenterology hospital in England and has some remarkable doctors. I contacted them when I was going through chemo for breast cancer as I also have panCrohn's disease and there was a problem with controlling the Crohn's. I had a quick reply from one of their Professors ( Prof. Alastair Forbes) and this helped sort out my treatment during the long months of chemo and radiotherapy. 

 You might also ring the National Association for Colitis and Crohn's Disease, (NACC) 4 Beaumont House, Sutton Road, St. Albans, Herts AL1 5HH. Tel: 01727 844296 since both Crohn's and Colitis carry a high risk of cancer of the colon and they may be able help you with surgical queries. 
Hope you get the best treatment you can for your Mum.

							Thank you Liz and Cake for your helpful replies.

Liz: I will add this hospital contact to my list, and how fortunate for you to get a swift response from a Professor.....it kind of restores ones faith in the system doesn't it, there are some amazing and dedicated people out there. I hope that your illness and treatment is now behind you.

Cake: This link was very interesting, as it was the Basingstoke NHS trust Bowel Cancer Specialist Unit that I contacted following my Mother's diagnosis, basically because there was tons of Internet stuff on the team that pioneered the surgery in the first place from that hospital, but this charitable trust, I wonder is it part of the same thing or a separate entity? The list of consultants appears to be the same but the contact details are different, perhaps they flit between the different units. I will certainly look into this.  Was the surgery successful?

Again, thank you both for taking the time to reply.

							Hi Angela

I don't know much about charity entity in Pelikan Centre (I know they got funds from people who want to give, but that's all).  During our journey there, I just saw the surgical part and was not ""called"" by a charity team, althought there were many ""advertising"" about it (i don't have the right word)

My writing was just about the surgery team, lead by Pr RJ Heald, who perform the surgery on my husband (very low resection , < 1 cm fom anal verge) and that succeed. Heald was the last reference for us (we found this on the Internet). We live in France, and there, 2 specialist told us that permanent colostomy was the only solution for us. 
Living all you life with this prothesis is psychology hard, and doctors don't say that ! It may cause suicide, because what is behind and controlled becomes forward, seen, not controlled, and noisy. the social and professional life is affected, deeply.

About NHS in Basingstoke, I can say we were well received. They were the only one to ask if - being the pateint's wife - I needed something on a medical point of view (to get less nervous in this period). In France, specialists take care of the patients, but not the relatives (at least the 2 that I saw). My advice is : if Heald tells you it's possible : he'll do the maximum for that.. He has more than 25 years (and statistics in return) about his surgical methods. He's not over the others one in the world for a small reason! And his collegues (Cecil  for example) operate with him.

I got nothing to earn by saying that, that's really our experience. And we came abroad for that. Even if we have some others problems (metastasis in lungs) we are happy to have done that. We don't have the hardness to live with such a prothesis.

Kind regards

							Angela,

I am glad you have excellent physicians. Your mother's case is not common, to have anal and rectal cancer at the same time. It is certainly a specialist's case, and I am sure there are no clinical trials for that given the rarity of it. But it sounds she is being taken care of, and I will certainly hope for the best.

							Hi Cake,

I am assuming thr Pelikan centre is perhaps the private clinic whereas The Basingstoke NHS trust is part of our health service. Did you have to pay for treatment?

Thank God you were able to find a Surgeon you felt comfortable with. No one can perform miracles but it is so important to feel you are in safe hands. On the subject of colostomy, it can cause great emotional problems for some people, perhaps a loss of dignity, some cope better than others, it is very personal.

I am so sorry to hear your husband has lung related disease....this must be very hard to cope with but you are clearly continuing to face this disease with immense courage. I thank you again for taking the time to relate your story, it cannot have been easy, but it is important to share experience with others.

Please take care,

							Hello

Thanks for posting. Being diagnosed with cancer can be overwhelming. CLL is not the most aggressive forms of leukemia, however advances stages can be difficult to treat. It is usually a slowly progressive disease, very difficult to cure, but people generally live for several years with this condition.

Sorry for jumping in on your thread but I must take Leo to task on his comments.

Leo.

CLL is incurable, 30% of people with CLL will live a normal life compared to age and sex matched controls (remember the avearage age of diagnosis is nearing 70), 30% will need treatment which is only palliative at best, 30% will need treatment at diagnosis.

The only stages of CLL that are treated are ""advanced stages"" and no treatment has been shown to prolong survival. 

CLL is cancer of the immune system (B-Lymphocytes) and the largest factor in morbidity is opportunistic infection. The body cannot mount an immune response and we die of pnuemonia not CLL   

CLL can also lead to heamatological auto-immune disease most commonly Idiopathic Thrombocytopenia Pupura ITP and Autoimmune hemolytic anemia AIHA

ITP is fatal you eventually bleed to death, this is after they have removed your spleen and platelet stimulating growth factors no longer work.

10% of CLL patients will go through Richters transformation and develop an aggressive leukemia.

Sorry to vent but I am sick of CLL being the ""Good Cancer""

							My dad was diagnosed with hepatocellular carcinoma in 75 to 80% of his liver in August 2004.  The doctor then said he had maybe a year to live, maybe less.  He's gone vegetarian, consuming a lot of fresh vegetable and fruit juices, but the lethargy is becoming more pronounced.  He's got a slightly yellow cast to his sking but his eyes are clear.  Last week he developed some peripheral edema which is persistent (he didn't tell my mom about it til yesterday).  I haven't been able to find any information on stages of cancer/liver failure so that we've got a general idea of how he's doing.  My sister lives in California and would like to make a trip home before he dies- we've been using the amount of jaundice as a sort of barometer (lacking anything else).  Does anyone have any better information for me?

The good news is that Dad feels good and while the edema is irritating it's not painful.  He's still working and in good spirits.

							Hello

Sorry to hear about his situation. Edema can be a sign of several things: malnourishment, low albumin in the blood (comes with liver failure and cirrhosis), but may also be due to congestive heart failure, blood clots affecting the legs or large veins inside the abdomen (inferior vena cava). 

My advice to you would be to take one day at a time. Take your father's functional status, i.e, what he can and can not do as a marker of how sick he is. Example: how independent is he ? Can he take care of himself, shower, eat etc ? Or does he need someone to assist him ? Is he mobile or is he confined to bed or wheelchair ? These are ways to estimate how well or not someone is doing.

							I am sorry to hear about your father. I lost a good friend April 15th to liver cancer. I hope I can help you by giving a short history of the last months of his life. 
For starters, he had no health insurance and was 61 years old. He had been losing weight since the fall of 2004. He had no explanation for the sudden weight loss and thought nothing of it. He made a trip to Europe for his birthday in January as he always did. When he returned he developed edema from the knees down. It was so bad that the skin actually broke open in some areas and bled lightly. Being a tool and die maker he was on his feet all day. At the end of February he became ill with what he thought was a cold. He slept a lot and was not eating much. Finally he went into urgent care when he developed breathing problems. It was March 15th.  He told the doctor he had pain under his ribcage on the right side. He was lethargic. He was developing jaundice, but not in the whites of his eyes. 
The doctor performed blood work and ordered an MRI, which was performed April 7th. The liver was riddled with tumors. He also had cancer in his bone marrow. He was told to see an oncologist, whic he did April 12. The doctor recommended calling Hospice. 
All during this time he was showing up for work. He drove for the last time April 11. The next day he was more tired. He was drinking a Slam Fast in the morning and nothing in the afternoons. Hospice came April 13. He was still quite tired and in pain. He was having a lot of trouble sleeping at night in the last 10 days. His abdomen hurt badly. Ascites developed which made his back sore. April 14th he never got out of bed. He had been groggy for the last week, and was getting more unresponsive. He also developed terrible hiccups. The increased pressure on the abdomen pushed against the phrenic nerve and causes uncontrollable hiccups that persist even while sleeping.
I called Hospice and we thought it best that he go to a care center. He woke up for a little while that day but was very dehydrated and had trouble speaking. He went into the care center that afternoon. He stopped eating. We gave him a morphine drip which made him even more groggy but took away the pain. You see, as the body dies, it dehydrates itself and also becomes malnourished. This causes the ammonia levels in the blood to rise to toxic levels which creates a sedative for the brain. It is the bodys way of dying peacefully.  
I saw him one more time. April 15th I went to see him around noon and he was breathing heavily. Short breaths with a rattling of fluids in the lungs. He was breathing though his mouth which he had been doing for several days. I knew he was close to death. I called his name and he woke for a moment then went back to sleep. I left and he died 15 minutes later. I did not go back in the room.
It was exactly one month before that he went to see a doctor. I found a diary beginning January 1st. He noted January 15th as the day his legs began to swell. It lasted about three weeks. He noted Feb 26 as ""not feeling good at all, body sore."" He was experiencing hot and cold flashes in the last month of his life. 
I look back and wish I could have helped him more, said more things. But we never knew it would happen so fast. He went downhill quickly in the last week. He never believed he was going to die. Many things were left undone. I feel sad; so sad, then I remember the great times we spent together and speak with our mutual friends about the past. I am so sorry that you have to go through this. It just isn't fair. Be strong because you will get through it. And when he dies you will experience a feeling of finality that is very refreshing. It is all over. I hope that I was of help to you. I would suggest calling hospice when the time is right and getting some literature about the final days. It helped me greatly. Alex

							I wish I had seen this forum before, It would've helped me a lot.
My mom, 52 past away last february 2nd 2005.   She died of liver cancer and it all lasted about 8 months, well, the sympthoms, because a liver cancer can be developed over years before even having any sympthoms.
It was so hard and painful to us all, and to tell you the truth there is not much you can do although you will always expect a mirracle to happen.  My mom just got 2 dosis of iv chemo and then she took oral chemo.  We read a lot on the subject and tried a lot of things, but what gave her a best living quality was accupunture and different herbs because chemotherapy has many side effects and it kills bad and good cells equally, so she had some uncomfortable side effects like soar hands and feet, to mention just one, she couldn't even walk or touch anything.
She started accupunture and herbs the day after she was told she had 2 weeks more.   She didn't live 2 weeks but 7 months more after that diagnosis, so you never know.      My dad and I read that in Europe, specifically in Germany,  they are quitting chemotherapy which has thousands of toxic substances and trying natural treatments to help people with cancer.
I think Leo gave you a great piece of advice by telling you to take one day at a time.  That's the best you can do.  That's what I kept telling my mom and she really tried to.    There will be better days than others.
here's still a long way for you and your family to go trough, but keep your faith and never give up.  Always respect your dad's decisions and do your best to keep him comfortable.  That will make you feel in peace after everything is over.   You'll always feel you could've done more, but I think it's a common feeling in this situations.
My mom died in her bedroom, she did'nt want to die in a hospital so we kept her at home.  My beautiful mom died painlessly as my dad, my sister and I held both of her hands.   During the last weeks she developed fluid in her lungs, the doctors told us to expect a series of traumatic events, such as asfixia to name one, but none of them happened.  She left peacefully surrounded by her loved ones.   I hope she's now in a better place.  
I sincerely wish the best for your you and your family, you might want to hit me in the eye for saying this but believe it or not sooner or later you'll find a good reason behind all this suffering.  We are just finding out ours.
I'm writing from Guadalajara, Mexico so my English is not that good. I hope I made myself understandable.

							I have had a mild to moderately atypical mole excised last april from my left middle toe. No melanoma, thank God. I have a regular checkup scheduled in about a month and was quite sure no similar mole appeared in the last year, but -    lo and behold: This evening I have discovered a dysplastic nevus that I do not remember having. It's fuzzy edged and weardly shaped, having at least 3 bands of different brown (apart on the edge almost black) and it's leveled with the skin too.
The only good thing about it is that it's only about 3.5x2.5mm in size...

While I have read most of what's available on the web and talked extensively with several doctors I know chances of a melanoma are so minuscule I might as well be hit by a passing-by black hole. I do not want to sound too worried... but, since my 30 year old friend just died of breast cancer a week ago... this is an extremely bad time for my skin to be playing tricks on me.

							A survivor's story - I was diagnosed with stage II Hodgkins 16 1/2 yrs ago at the same time that I discovered that I was approx 3 - 4 weeks pregnant. 
The Hodgkins was isolated to the nodes in my neck and a tumor in my chest (the size of a large orange/small grapefruit). 8 months later, after the birth of my 4th child (a healthy girl), and after 3 sessions (months) of chemo, and 20 days of radiation, the tumor disappeared. I am a 16 1/2 year survivor and now am very proud of it! At that time though, I was 30 years old with 4 children under 9, a good job, a great husband and a great life overall - but was very bitter about what was happening to me.

I have been associated with Relay for Life - a 12 hour walking marathon for teams of 10 people - for the past 3 years as well as this year. The event is all about the survivors and honors the memory of those that passed away because of cancer. 
My involvement over the 4 years has included walking as part of a team, walking in the emotional survivor lap that kicks off the Relay event, a reader during the equally emotional luminary ceremony, serving as team captain, serving as secretary (twice) for the Relay organizational committee and serving as luminary co-chair for this year's event. 
Being involved with this event to bring awareness to the fact that there are many, many survivors (I always heard about the many that died, but only knew very few survivors), and to raise funds for cancer research and programs, has helped me ""heal"" emotionally. I'm not ashamed to admit that I have (had) cancer. As a survivor, I know that the many dollars and time that are spent on research is a good investment - I'm here aren't I!
Hodgkins has a very high treatment rate (can't say cure - I was told we are never ""cured""). 
Best wishes to all of you that are fighting the ""monster"". 

There is a sad twist to my story though - my oldest daughter was diagnosed with an adenocarcinoma of unknown origin (the original location of the tumor was never found) and passed away at 21 years a few years ago. She fought hard to the end. Unfortunately, even though she was losing weight, she felt fine and did not go to a doctor until it was too late for treatment to be effective.  Early detection is important!
Take care everyone!

							Dear Angel's Mom,

I was diagnosed with NHL last January, which came as a complete surprise to me since I'd always been healthy, but I guess this is of the sneaky cancers.  I'm a teacher and had no symptoms other than what I thought were those of the beginning of the flu.  After the usual tests I began chemo on my 57th birthday in February and have completed 5 out of six now.  I hope the sixth will be the last...and that nothing will come back.  I'm very positive, eat well, do all the ""right"" things, and keep my sense of humor.  Would love to hear from others out there in the same rocky boat.  I'm so sorry about your daughter; I have a friend here who lost her son in a similar manner.

If I may ask, how do you get over the anger and bittness, and do things ever return to normal?  When is a head ache nothing more than a head ache.

							Hi Bill
As for things returning to normal - they basically did when I returned to work after my treatments - life went on - kids were in school, and we all had extracurricular activities that kept all of us busy over the years. The only thing out of the ordinary was the regular check-up trips I made to the city, but even those dwindled to nothing. 

After my daughter's passing, normal may never return - because she is not present at family events such as Christmas, etc. and I don't get to hear her voice at the other end of a phone call. 
The lack of her presence was so noticable only 2 days after her passing. Our 2nd oldest daughter graduated from a post-secondary school 4 hours away from our home. We attended the graduation (making funeral arrangements and phoning prospective pallbearers, ushers, memorial book attendants while traveling) and had our picture taken with her in her cap and gown. There were only 5 of us instead of 6. To every other family nearby we looked like a ""normal"" family, but we knew otherwise and it definitely felt different. It would have been one thing if she couldn't attend because she was working, but the realization hit that our family photos would never be the same. 

As for anger - it eventually disappeared - when I don't even know.

Bitterness - that may never go away - I was bitter that God let this happen to me of all people! 
I read somewhere that some people when faced with a life-threatening diagnosis lose their faith, while for others that faith is strengthened. My uncle was one of those people - his faith strengthened. 
But for me it was the opposite - I attended church and took part in the mass as a reader, and served on the church board before my diagnosis - after the diagnosis I haven't been back to church since other than to have my baby daughter baptized and to attend funerals. 
I lost my faith - and when my daughter passed away we didn't have a religious funeral in a church - it was a celebration of her life without the religion. I did permit a minister friend to say one small prayer just for the sake of my parents and in-laws who are devoutly religious. Needless to say, they were not impressed with our choice of a non-religous funeral service. 

I think that part of my feelings stem from people wanting to help after my diagnosis - not the type of help to run errands etc - I was grateful for that type of help. It was people praying for me, holding mass in my name, that made me feel like I was up on some pedestal - I was ashamed that I had cancer - that I had somehow ""failed"" - and despised the negative attention that this gave me. I would to out in public with my kerchief, and a hat - and felt that everyone who looked at me ""knew"" exactly what had happened to me and how I had failed. I know - because when I see people with kerchiefs etc I know what they are going through - it is so noticable. 

As for when a headache is only a headache - that is the fear of the unknown - for several years I would become very anxious shortly before my checkups - and then relieved when the x-rays etc showed no signs of recurrance. I don't know if that feeling will ever go away totally. I think it becomes less and less fearful, although each time I feel a lymph node that seems a little bigger than maybe it should be, I still get worried and its been 16 1/2 years. 

I was recently interviewed by the local newspaper in preparation for the upcoming ""Relay For Life"" event in our community next weekend. I was asked why I ""Relay"" - I became involved with the event after my daughter's passing and feel that it has helped with the healing process - I don't feel so ashamed anymore. 
Also, the outpouring of emotion and help that we recieved during and after my daughter's diagnosis and passing was overwhelming and I realized for the first time that people really do want to be helpful - and since then I don't feel so upset with the people that prayed for me (etc) 16 years ago. 
My daughter did not like the extra attention either when she learned that a trust fund was set up for her and a fundraiser was planned to assist us with our travel expenses and her living expenses since she couldn't work (we live in Canada so her medical expenses were covered by the provincial health plan). 

I've rambled a fair bit, and I don't know if I've made you feel any better, but at least you know that if you feel the same way you'll know you're as ""normal"" as you can be with your feelings. We're all so different - and it might not affect the next person at all. 

Take care

I had non hodgkins lymphoma at age 6 and had a less than 10% chance of survival, yet here I sit typing away.  I give all the credit to God, the doctors told my parents to plan for my death.  I coded 3 sepeate time during my treatment, to me, unbelievable for my partents to deal with.  I can't say I blame my dad for his views.  However, I am unexplained.  I should be dead. even with medical intervention.  But here I sit A merical, I say, no other way to explain it.  Everything has reason, even if we don't understand it.  My dad says it was me, I cured myself, my inner strength.  I say no one has inner strenth like that. I thank God for my life as offten as I can.

What kind of cancer do you have?

							The initial approach to using radiation postoperatively to treat brain metastases, used to be whole brain radiation, but this was abandoned because of the substantial neurological deficits that resulted, sometimes appearing a considerable time after treatment. Whole brain radiation was routinely administered to patients after craniotomy for excision of a cerebral metastasis in an attempt to destroy any residual cancer cells at the surgical site. However, the deleterious effects of whole brain radiation, such as dementia and other irreversible neurotoxicities, became evident.

This raised the question as to whether elective postoperative whole brain radiation should be administered to patients after excision of a solitary brain metastasis. Current clinical practice, at a number of leading cancer centers, use a more focused radiation field (Radiotherapy) that includes only 2-3cm beyond the periphery of the tumor site. This begins as soon as the surgical incision has healed.

Many metastatic brain lesions are now being treated with stereotactic radiosurgery. In fact, some feel radiosurgery is the treatment of choice for most brain metastases. There are a number of radiation treatments for therapy (Stereotatic, Gamma-Knife, Cyber-Knife, Brachyradiation and IMRT to name a few). These treatments are focal and not diffuse. Unlike surgery, few lesions are inaccessible to radiosurgical treatment because of their location in the brain. Also, their generally small size and relative lack of invasion into adjacent brain tissue make brain metastases ideal candidates for radiosurgery. Multiple lesions may be treated as long as they are small.

The risk of neurotoxicity from whole brain radiation is not insignificant and this approach is not indicated in patients with a solitary brain metastasis. Observation or focal radiation is a better choice in solitary metastasis patients. Whole brain radiation can induce neurological deterioration, dementia or both. Those at increased risk for long-term radiation effects are adults over 50 years of age. However, whole brain radiation therapy has been recognized to cause considerable permanent side effects mainly in patients over 60 years of age. The side effects from whole brain radiation therapy affect up to 90% of patients in this age group. Focal radiation to the local tumor bed has been applied to patients to avoid these complications.

Aggressive treatment like surgical resection and focal radiation to the local tumor bed in patients with limited or no systemic disease can yield long-term survival. In such patients, delayed deleterious side effects of whole brain radiation therapy are particularly tragic. Within 6 months to 2 years patients can develop progressive dementia, ataxia and urinary incontinence, causing severe disability and in some, death. Delayed radiation injuries result in increased tissue pressure from edema, vascular injury leading to infarction, damage to endothelial cells and fibrinoid necrosis of small arteries and arterioles.

Even the studies performed by Dr. Roy Patchell, et al, in the early and late 90's have been recognized incorrectly, sometimes, in the radiation oncology profession. The studies were thought to have been the difference between surgical excision of brain tumor alone vs. surgical excision & whole brain radiation. It was a study of whole brain radiation of a brain tumor alone vs. whole brain radiation & surgical excision. The increased success had been the surgery. And they measured ""tumor recurrence"", not ""long-term survival"". Patients experiencing any survival could have been dying from radiation necrosis, starting within two years of whole brain radiation treatment and documented as ""complications of cancer"" not ""complications of treatment"". There may have been less ""tumor recurrence"" but not more ""long-term survival"".

Patchell's studies convincingly showed there was no survival benefit or prolonged independence in patients who received postoperative whole brain radiation therapy. The efficacy of postoperative radiotherapy after complete surgical resection had not been established. It never mentioned the incidence of dementia, alopecia, nausea, fatigue or any other numerous side effects associated with whole brain radiation. The most interesting part of this study were the patients who lived the longest. Patients in the observation group who avoided neurologic deaths had an improvement in survival, justifying the recommendation that whole brain radiation therapy is not indicated following surgical resection of a solitary brain metastasis.

An editorial to Patchell's studies by Drs. Arlan Pinzer Mintz and J. Gregory Cairncross (JAMA 1998;280:1527-1529) described the morbidity associated with whole brain radiation and emphasized the importance of individualized treatment decisions and quality-of-life outcomes. The morbidity associated with whole brain radiation does not indicate whole brain radiation therapy following surgical resection of a solitary brain metastasis. Patients who avoided the neurologic side effects of whole brain radiation had an improvement in survival. There is no survival benefit or prolonged independence in patients who received postoperative whole brain radiation therapy. There may have been some less tumor recurrence but not more long-term survival.

Had fatigue, memory loss and other adverse effects of whole brain radiation been considered, and had quality of life been measured, it might be less clear that whole brain radiation is the right choice for all patients. These patients do not remain functionally independent longer, nor do they live longer than those that have surgery alone, said researchers in a report in an issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association.

Even M.D. Anderson Cancer Center, noted in their OncoLog, that whole brain radiation may still be the standard for ""four or more"" brain tumors, however, there are a variety of effective treatment modalities for people who have fewer than four tumors, and in particular for a solitary brain metastasis. The UCLA Metastatic Brain Tumor Program's goal is to treat metastatic disease ""focally"" so as to spare normal brain tissue and function. Focal treatment allows retreatment of local and new recurrences. This treatment delivers a single, large dose of radiation that is precisely targeted to the tumor and causes minimal damage to surrounding brain structures.

The results of a recent study at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine reported that treating four or more brain tumors in a single radiosurgery session resulted in improved survival compared to whole brain radiation therapy alone. In the study, patients with primary malignancies that had metastasized to the brain underwent Gamma-Knife radiosurgery and the results indicated that treating four or more brain tumors with radiosurgery is safe and effective and translates into a survival benefit for patients.

Sometimes, symptoms of brain damage appear many months or years after radiation therapy, a condition called late-delayed radiation damage (radiation necrosis or radiation encephalopathy). Radiation necrosis may result from the death of tumor cells and associated reaction in surrounding normal brain or may result from the necrosis of normal brain tissue surrounding the previously treated metastatic brain tumor. Such reactions tend to occur more frequently in larger lesions (either primary brain tumors or metastatic tumors). Radiation necrosis has been estimated to occur in 20% to 25% of patients treated for these tumors. Some studies say it can develop in at least 40% of patients irradiated for neoplasms following large volume or whole brain radiation and possibly 3% to 9% of patients irradiated focally for brain tumors that developed clinically detectable focal radiation necrosis. In the production of radiation necrosis, the dose and time over which it is given is important, however, the exact amounts that produce such damage cannot be stated.

Late effects of whole brain radiation can include abnormalities of cognition (thinking ability) as well as abnormalities of hormone production. The hypothalamus is the part of the brain that controls pituitary function. The pituitary makes hormones that control production of sex hormones, thyroid hormone, cortisol. Both the pituitary and the hypothalamus will be irradiated if whole brain radiation occurs. Damage to these structures can cause disturbances of personality, libido, thirst, appetite, sleep and other symptoms as well. Psychiatric symptoms can be a prominent part of the clinical picture presented when radiation necrosis occurs.

Again, whole brain radiation is the most damaging of all types of radiation treatments and causes the most severe side effects in the long run to patients. In the past, patients who were candidates for whole brain radiation were selected because they were thought to have limited survival times of less than 1-2 years and other technology did not exist. Today, many physicians question the use of whole brain radiation in most cases as one-session radiosurgery treatment can be repeated for original tumors or used for additional tumors with little or no side effects from radiation to healthy tissues. Increasingly, major studies and research have shown that the benefits of radiosurgery can be as effective as whole brain radiation without the side effects.

Cerebral radiation necrosis is a debilitating, potentially life-threatening and increasingly frequent problem in patients with brain tumors. These symtoms can be from progression of cancer or it can be caused by the side effects of whole brain radiation. However, the FDG-Pet Scan can provide a reliable technique for diagnosing tumor recurrence from necrosis. Until the new millenium, the only treatment for patients with confirmed symptomatic radiation-induced necrosis was pentoxifylline or heparin therapy, and it was almost always unsuccessful. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy (HBO) is now a useful terapeutic option for patients.

The most common condition treated at some Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy Centers is tissue injury caused by brain radiation therapy for cancer. Wound healing requires oxygen delivery to the injured tissues. Radiation damaged tissue has lost blood supply and is oxygen deprived. Chronic radiation complications result from scarring and narrowing of the blood vessels within the area which has received the treatment. Hyperbaric Oxygen Therapy provides a better healing environment and leads to the growth of new blood vessels in a process called re-vascularization. It also fights infection by direct bacteriocidal effects. Using hyperbaric treatment protocols, ""most"" patients with chronic radiation injuries can be cured.

Hyperbaric oxygen therapy is administered by delivering 100 percent oxygen at pressures greater than atmospheric (sea level) pressure to a patient in an enclosed chamber. Hyperbaric oxygen acts as a drug, eliciting varying levels of response at different treatment depths, durations and dosages, and has been proven effective as adjunctive therapy for specifically indicated conditions.

Oxygen is a natural gas that is absolutely necessary for life and healing. Purified oxygen is defined as a drug but is the most natural of all drugs. Oxygen under pressure is still the same gas but is more able to penetrate into parts of the body where the arterial flow is hindered, producing ischemia (loss of blood flow) and hypoxia (lack of oxygen). When oxygen under pressure is breathed by a patient in a sealed chamber, it is termed a hyperbaric oxygen treatment (HBOT).

In addition to raising the arterial levels of oxygen 10 to 15 times higher than that produced by normal atmospheric pressure, the pressure exerted within the body can and does exert therapeutic benefits on acute and chronically traumatized and swollen tissus.

							Treating four or more brain tumors in a single radiosurgery session resulted in improved survival 

Medical Study News Published: Tuesday, October 18, 2005 

Treating four or more brain tumors in a single radiosurgery session resulted in improved survival compared to whole brain radiation therapy alone, according to a study the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine presented at the 47th Annual Meeting of the American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) in Denver. 

""Cancer patients with multiple metastases to the brain face very grim prognoses and limited treatment options,"" said John Flickinger, M.D., senior author of the study and professor of radiation oncology at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. ""In the past, these patients were not considered candidates for radiosurgery. The results of our study indicate that treating four or more brain tumors with radiosurgery is safe and effective and translates into a survival benefit for patients."" 

Two hundred and five patients with primary malignancies that had metastasized to the brain underwent gamma knife radiosurgery for four or more tumors during one session. Gamma knife is a non-invasive, computer-driven, bloodless brain surgery that uses cobalt 60 to destroy tumors and vascular malformations and requires no surgical incisions. The average number of brain tumors for patients in the study was five, with a range from four to 18. Radiosurgery was used alone, in combination with whole brain radiation or after failure of whole brain radiation. 

Radiosurgery patients with the most prognostic factors associated with survival from brain metastases (defined as class 1 according to the Radiation Therapy Oncology Group classification system for patients with brain metastases) survived an average of 18 months, compared to a reported historical average of seven months for those who received whole brain radiation alone. Patients defined as class 2 who received radiosurgery survived nine months compared to the historical average survival of four months for patients who received whole brain radiation. Patients with the least prognostic factors associated with survival (class 3) who received radiosurgery survived an average of three months compared to the historical average survival of two months for patients who received whole brain radiation. The average overall survival for patients who received radiosurgery was eight months and the average time to progression and new brain metastases was nine months. 

""The study also found that the sum of the volume of all treated brain tumors was a more significant predictor of length of survival than was the total number of brain metastases, indicating that tumor volume should be used as a criterion for radiosurgery rather than number of brain metastases,"" added L. Dade Lunsford, M.D., Lars Leksell professor and chairman of the department of neurological surgery at the University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. 

""Typically, only patients with one to three brain metastases are considered candidates for stereotactic radiosurgery,"" said Ajay K. Bhatnagar, M.D., study presenter and resident, department of radiation oncology, University of Pittsburgh School of Medicine. ""However, based on the results from this study, we conclude that the number of brain metastases should not necessarily preclude patients with multiple lesions from this potentially life-saving treatment option."" 

Also involved in the study from the University of Pittsburgh's departments of radiation oncology and neurological surgery was Douglas Kondziolka, M.D.

							Hello,

I have been diagnosed, at the VA hospital, La Jolla CA, with a squemous hypophargeal cancer (1.2cm) T1 near the base of my tongue.  I have been given two Tx options:  Radiation x 38, covering an area from the lower jaw down to the clavicle.  This Tx will result in a permanent dry-mouth condition, which will lead to removal of all teeth and preclude the wearing of dentures.  The second option is surgery; The procedure would require removal of all lymph glands from the ear down to the clavicle, require a week stay in hospital with feeding and breathing tube and run the risk of damaging control of the facial muscles wherein smiling is out and drooling is in.

I am a (poor) 60 yr old male looking to manage this disease with as little trauma and risk as possible.  So far, Tx looks like killing a gnat with a sledgehammer.   What are you thoughts and opinion?

							Hey everybody.  Sorry I haven't posted anything lately.  My mom had her lymph node biopsy 2 weeks ago, they took out 2 nodes, one came back with a very small cancer on it. She went last thursday and had her mast. reconstruction and they took out a lot of her other lymph nodes.  She was pretty sick after surgery but got to come home 2 days later.  She's doing much better. We went this past wednesday (the 6th) and got a good report.  The cancer had not spread to any of her other lymph nodes except that one.  Her cancer is also estrogen receptive positive.  
She starts chemotherapy in about 3-4 weeks.  She's not looking forward to it, but we will get through it.  She will have 4 treatments over a period of 12-16 wks.  I know some people do ok with it, but some people don't.  She is having second thoughts b/c she believes by what the docs said that they got all the cancer, but we hate to take that chance just in case it had spread somewhere else.

							Hi,
Every step of this disease and treatment is scary.  Most people tolerate chemo well.   If she has nausea, they have better meds now then they did even 3 years ago when I was going through it.  The main side affect is she'll be tired more and get tired easier.  She needs to listen to her body and rest when she's tired.  Most also have very good days in between treatments.  I don't know what kind of chemo she's going to be getting, but I got 3 at the same time and I was tired and didn't feel good for several days after, but then there were days that I didn't feel any different then before I started chemo.  The hardest part for me was losing my hair.  I had always had it long and when it didn't come out in the normal 12-14 days and I still had it all after 3 treatments, we thought I might be one of those very few that don't lose their hair, but right before the 4th treatment, it started coming out.  I was devistated, but you accept that too and then you celebrate your first bad hair day... lol  I looked like alfalfa (sp) all over and I didn't even comb it down, I was proud of it..... lol
She'll do great and with you there to support her, that will mean alot.

							So glad to hear your Mom got through this phase of her  journey.Remember you can only live one day at a time there are alot of different things to cope with just try not to get overwhelmed.You will both get through this.It's a scary time for everyone-I remember thinking the same thing.Should I go through the treatments or not then I looked at my Family they were suffering right there with me,I wasn't ready to give up on life,not seeing my children through there lifes challenges or triumphs.I thought also that they may have gotten it all with surgery , but what if they didn't! And because I was scared I didn't take the treatments and it came back and took my life-I wouldn't have done all that was possible to make sure that I was here for my family .Life is short enough,it really makes you look at what's really important-and I'm not ready to give it up.
It's probably not going to be easy,there are alot of unknowns,but it makes a world of difference when your family and friends are there for you-you may even find out who you're true friends really are,I know I did.But things are so much better these days than in the past.She needs to get lots of rest and a proper diet,lots of fresh untainted fruits and vegetables.

 My dad was diagnosed with follicular lymphoma about a month ago. I Think we are still in the staging part of all this. 
Yesterday, he showed me his bone marrow biopsy results : "" a few clusters of hematropoietic components with 3 cell lineage maturation;
Erythroid cells appear hyperplastic;
Lack of cellularity precludes further evaluation""
He didn't understand it. His Doctor has suggested daily radiation for a month, and discussed that with him, but did not explain the biopsy. Does anyone know if these results are 'normal', or expected or not? My dad is   77, and seems in fairly good health otherwise.

							Hello

Bone marrow biopsies can be very tricky to interpret. Usually only very specialized pathologists read bone marrows. 

Anyway, what it means is that further evaluation could not be done due to the specimen not having many cells to evaluate. The three cellular type were present there: red cells, white cells and platelet precursors. And that the red cell precursors were hyperplastic, i.e. larger. This is nonspecific.

I had a full MUD BMT for ALL p+ last year (when I was 29).
10 months in hospital I almost broke their record !
I didn't leave until day 150 of my transplant..

							Dear Sir,

Thanks for posting. I am the webmaster here, and would love to try to help you.  As you now realize the type of leukemia you had is very difficult to cure with chemotherapy alone. Since you are young and otherwise healthy (I presume), BMT was the right thing to do, and I am glad to know that you are doing well.

I assume such a prolonged hospitalization means also a long recovery period. I hope you make daily progresses.

Please let me know how we can try to help you. One thing is that we can stimulate other people to post here and form a great community.

							The thing I'm trying to get over is the physical and phsyhological damage that is done. I was a complete criple mentaly and physicaly for about 8 months post transplant , after another 8 months crawling back to normality I'm feeling pretty good.
The treatment here in the UK seems pretty good, I've heard other places (possibly Oz still call ALLp+ terminal)...
The hard thing about Leuchaemia and others is that sometimes your just not going to make it.. and thats a hard thing for a forum to help with.
And as for the age thing, thank god I was only 29, My hospital said they don't normaly do a full MUD transplant after 35... And now I know why....
The other problem is that everyone has a different type and its hard to find someone whos been through the things you have personally....
Anyway if someone reads this they can post....

							You're not alone age-wise.  I was 28 when I was dx with acute myeloid leukemia.  I have not had to go through with a bmt (yet), and so far, chemo-only has been effective.

However, I was put into a drug-induced coma for 18 days, and I had some severe physical and mental issues to work through.  I started out in a wheelchair and had to learn and train my body to do everything all over again.  I had to be trained in how to swallow again, even.  I was not all there mentally, either.  My memory for certain time periods is just gone, and really fuzzy for others.  My reasoning skills were off, too.  I suffered some degree of brain damage because of some brain stem swelling I had (most likely the cancer spread to my brain), and the doctors compared its effects to severe trauma.  There will probably be long term brain damage issues for me to deal with.

But, I fought through it.  A positive attitude makes a huge difference, and so does a supportive family.

I'm not terribly sure what you're able to do yet, but the physical therapist I was seeing encouraged the use of a Nintendo Wii in my hospital room as well as typing on the computer and other repetitive low impact activities.  My doctors wanted to see me stimulating my brain in whatever ways I could, and using the computer was an approved activity.  Reading was approved, too, but my eyesight was such a wreck because the leukemia was in my retinas, too, that I couldn't read small print.  I could at least make text on the computer screen big enough to see.

							Dear Users,

I just read an article about a test known as CellSearch, which measures circulating tumor cells in the blood. It seems when more than 5 circulating tumor cells (CTCs) in 7.5ml of blood, the prognosis is not good. Whether this should be standard of care and if therapy should be changed after high levels of CTCs are detected are not well-defined.

Just to let you know that this option is out there, and that in my view it may eventually be incorporated into the follow-up routine of breast cancer patients...

There is no data about when it is useful. All we know comes from the studies that were done early after treatment. Still, this can be used at any point, even several years after.

A lump in the anal area can be a sign of cancer, however this most likely represents a hemorrhoid, which is by far more common than anal cancer. Regardless, you should be examined by a physician and have this evaluated.

About the higher risk of anal cancer with anal intercourse, it is because of infection by HPV.

							My 72 yr old Mom was just diagnosed with lung cancer after a year of trying to find out what was causing her dizzy spells and slurred speach. 
One Dr. even gave her a sea sickness patch! The cancer has caused brain tumors and swelling which caused the symptoms. She is getting radiation, but at this stage, do you think chemo would do any good? Of course, her doctors suggest it, but  her 1 yr survival chances appear very small. Is it better to try everything despite the quality of life issues, or let her live out her time in peace?

Thanks for posting. There is no right or wrong answer for this. It all depends how sick she is and how toxic the treatments would be to her. Also, if she is still capable of making decisions, the doctors could lay out her options and let her decide. It is true that at this stage chemotherapy can not prolong her life very much. Balancing the benefits and risks will be the most important thing here.

I read your post and wondered just how YOU must be feeling?  I have never had cancer but, I have had several loved ones face this most difficult of decisions.  I also have had many patients work through grief issues.  Please remember to take a little time to take care of yourself.  This goes for any small ones that you may have.  If you can find someone to see in your area do so. Surround yourself with all the support you can.  If anxiety or sadness appears to be taking over your days see your family Dr. He/she may be able to help you on their own or provide you with a referrral. Take a walk, a hot bath, treat yourself to some small thing.  Most of all remember this is far from your "" best of times""  but you will face this in your own special way.

							My mom was diagnosed with lung cancer on 1-20-05 at the age of 63.  Her prognosis was given as 8-10 months with no chemo and 1-2 yrs with.  She opted for chemo and after her first treatment of ""taxol"" her blood sugars were so high she was hospitalized for 1 week.  She bacame very weak and developed tingling in her feet.  Her oncologist then changed her to ""GenZar"" and she became unable to walk more than a few feet at a time because her jojnts were so painful.  At this time we decided no more chemo and began to look into Herbals, unfortunately we did not get a chance to see if the herbals worked because she developed pneumonia and passed away on 4-7-05.  Hindsight being what it is I believe towards the end she wished she had never taken a chemo treatment and just take the quality of life she could have had for the ""8-10 months"" and she may have been around to see 2 of her grandchildren graduate from high school.

							I had some questions so I thought I would try posting them here.  My grandfather has a tumor that is in between his stomach and pancreas- so it is not really any certain type of cancer. They were holding off on surgery bc it's a major operation, a lot of people they say don't even do it, but my grandpa is tough and won't allow himself to give up.  Radiation and chemo were never an option, but they upped his dosage of medicine he was taking (which basically eliminated his colon cancer he had before). He was 4 years cancer free then this. Now his tumor has grown, he has surgery on Monday.  He is very hopeful, but I wonder what really the odds are I guess.  Anything can happen and he has the right attitude about it, but I guess I would like to know what to be prepared for if anyone has been through similar experiences, both good and bad.  Thanks.

							Dear Kristy,

Thanks for posting. It is very hard to tell what the risks of surgery are, knowing what you've told me. First of all, I think the major problem here is that they do not know what type of cancer this is (maybe it is not even cancer, maybe it is an infection). Knowing the type of cancer would guide further treatment. Having stomach cancer, for example, is very different from having pancreatic cancer, in terms of treatment options. 

So the best for now is not to try to imagine all the complications and problems that may arise, but to focus on success and how the surgical findings are going to affect the next steps. If the team has done their best to figure this out and this is their best plan, it is off your or his hands, and now it is just a matter of time to know how to proceed after the surgery.

							Hello all my name is Rachelle and found this site by searching about Breast Cancer. I am 29 and I have been having chest pain on my left side for about 6 months. My PC has been doing EKG's and nothing. Well yesterday I had shortness of breath and the pain that comes and goes and she sent me to the ER. Well they have been the first to do a breast exam and found my lymph nodes all swelled under my armpit on my lfet side and up onto my breast. No lumps were found. They did do a chest xray and saw a mass above my heart that they said it could be from my ammonia I had 6 months ago. So they told me that my pain can not be handle in the ER and that I must make a appontment with my PC ASAP and get a mammogram done. They gave me some bactrim DS for the inflamation and muscle relaxers. They told me that they are not equipt in the ER to take care of the lymph nodes and that my PC will probably send me to a breast specialist to get the lymphs checked. My blood work was fine. I am so lost and confused my Aunt had breast cancer and I am afraid that this is what it is and that is has already spread becouse no one listned to me 6 months ago. I have checked on line and I know it states that after 50 is usually when people get breast cancer. I am 29 but I had a hysterectomy 2 years ago and have been on estorgen and also started by period when I was ten , also I have endometrosis. I have noticed that this all takes a factor in this. Can anyone make me feel better. I see my PC in two days.

							Hi Rachelle,
I am glad you found the site, hopefully someone will be able to share helpful information for you.  I am not positive, but I thought I heard someone say once that breast cancer usually is not painful, however I could be wrong.  Either way, its a good thing to get it checked out by your PCP.  You may need to be forceful and insist on further testing....like and MRI. For some reason some doctors will order any tests, like MRI, CT scan ...etc...but others you just have to nag and insist...... Usually young women have dense tissue in their breast and a mammogram does not always ""see"" through it.  I have dense tissue and in addition to the mammogram, I get an MRI every year.
Breast cancer really does not know an age. Although I know typically it is rare for one in their 20's.   I know so many young women that have had breast cancer, myself included (OK so I think 42 was young..lol)  Actually I know more women in their early 30's and 40's than over 50.
Your swollen lymph nodes could be just a sign of infection which the Batrim may take care of. 
I hope everything works out for the best for you, please keep us updated!
Kristen
						

"
"


							Kristen said it as well as anyone could.  Breast Cancer knows no age, I was 43 (and yes, that is as young as 42... lol).  Not to scare you, but my mammogram missed my tumor that I found and it was 5.5 cm which is large and I had positive lymph nodes as well.  I didn't have any pain in my lymph nodes, but 9 were positive for cancer.  I wouldn't stop at a mammogram, even if it says you're fine.  Mine said I was fine and needless to say, I wasn't.  If anyone says, ""let's watch it for 6 months"", find another doctor.  If the antibiodics take care of it, then I would say chances are extremely good it was some type of infection.  I think all the ladies here will tell you, not knowing and the waiting is the worst part.  Don't wait, get an appt. and get the ball rolling.  Chances are in your favor it's not BC, but you won't know until you're checked out and like you should be.  If it comes back, not breast cancer, you can breathe a sigh of relief and put this scare out of your mind, but always do self examines.  IF by chance, and I'm saying IF, it is, the sooner it's taken care of the less treatments will probably be necessary and of course the better the chances are you'll do great.  I had no family history of cancer of any kind.  Because your aunt had it, doesn't mean you will, but you need to be doing what you're doing and that's getting things checked out.  BC isn't a death sentence anymore.  I was dx Stage III and there are only 4 stages and 3 years+ later, I'm doing great.
I know of one lady that had no lump in her breast that could be found, but her lymph nodes were positive for breast cancer and she's the only one I've heard of like that.  I would say get an appt. and if the swelling and pain hasn't gone done and gotten better, I personally would tell the doctor you wanted a biopsy done on one or all of the nodes.  That would be something they would know better then me, since it's happening in the nodes only.  The American Cancer Society sent me literature AFTER I was dx and it said that mammograms miss 45% of all breast cancer in women under 50 and 35% in women over 50.  They are great tests and have saved many lives, but don't but all your trust in the mammogram, take it further.
Hugs and prayers and keep us posted.

One more thing.  I think it's 80%, but it could be higher, someone else I'm sure knows, but 80% of all breast cancer feeds off hormones.  With a family history and the problems you're having now, I personally would throw those hormones you're taking down the toilet.  I'm sure not everyone would agree with me, but I'm taking medicine to kill my hormones in hopes of preventing a reoccurence because my cancer was estrogen and progestrine positive, meaning, my cancer fed off hormones.

							Hi Rachelle. 

You are doing your best in continuing to get this checked out.  You are younger than most, but yes, there are some women who are only in their 20's who do get breast cancer. The vast majority of women are also not aware that some forms of breast cancer are especially difficult to detect. Science has created some ways (like mammograms) to look for breast cancers, but there are different kinds of breast cancer and some don't show up well even on mammograms. Going through the uncertainty while you are being tested is hard, and it is harder still if you complained some time ago about it to begin with. But even so, all you have to work with is the present. ***Doing your own research is your best protection***. Lymph nodes do swell up for other reasons besides breast cancer, but I have 2 books to recommend to you if it turns out to be breast cancer. One is Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book. The other is Take Charge of Your Breast Cancer, by Dr. John Link. One other recommendation I have is that you continue to participate in sites like this one. You will learn an awful lot whether or not you are diagnosed with breast cancer, and maybe avoid making many of the mistakes some of us have made as we stumbled around ourselves.

Why were the hormones prescribed for you?

							Hello

Thanks for posting. Like people mentioned above, there are other reasons for swollen axillary lymphnodes. If you have a chest infection or a pneumonia that is already a good reason to have it. Regardless, you need to be evaluated for this, and you should talk to your physician about this. It is my understanding that you are on hormones because of your histerectomy and oophorectomy. While this is what it takes to avoid menopausal symptoms since you have no ovaries, there are risks associated with it. I would not just stop taking the hormones right now, talk to your doctor and explain your concerns first.

As an aside, the participants here are affected by breast cancer, so you are not ""seeing"" people that had swollen lymphnodes and did fine. 

Again, most likely this is just reactive from the infection, but you need to be evaluated.

Please do keep us posted.  Also, I feel like a hypercrite (can't even spell it) because I hate when doctors automatically chalk women's chest pains to anxiety/stress.  I've had a problem with anxiety and take medicine for it and have for several years since my dx.  Since you have been checked out and they have ruled out any heart problems, like the cardiologist that I was sent to did, it could be anxiety causing the chest pains.  Also, I won't even attempt to spell it, but E........ Reflux can cause horrible chest pains.  I have that from time to time, but don't have the burning from acid in my throat, but have chest pains.  My mother has it so bad, she's actually in the Medical Journals and has gone to Shands in Gainseville, FL and has tried every medicine made.  She does have the burning from the acid backing up and bad chest pains.  The doctor told her that the symptoms are very similiar to a heart attack and if she notices anything different from another attack, to get to the ER.  I just wanted to throw those up as possiblities and hopefully your doctor can figure out what's causing your chest pains too.  They are definately scary.
Talk to you tomorrow when you get back from the doc.

							I was diagnosed with Basal Cell Carcinoma (BCC) and I went in yesterday to have two spots removed.  I really didn't feel it until the end when the anestetic began to wear off slightly and I could feel some of the stiches.    Overall, this procedure was pretty intense.

							Hello

There are other methods for this, but Mohs surgery is good at taking the disease out while taking minimal healthy tissue out. So it is a good technique. I would think more aggressive methods would take more tissue and therefore leave a worse scar. Plus, other methods rely on the surgeon's vision only, while with Mohs the surgeon is always evaluating the tissue with the microscope and then adjusting the next steps during surgery.

How lucky she was as she doesn't go through any surgery.

Unless halted, this error-generating process leads to an accumulation of mutant genes in the cell and, eventually, cancer.

In 1996 I had the same type of cancer in the upper right lobe and a lobectomy was performed. I have had a cat scan, a Pet scan and a Bronchoscopy. The final diagnosis is that the cancer has not spread form its original site. It is completely enclosed. 
My surgeon says he cannot operate because he would have to remove the 2 remaining lobes on my right side and my lung function test shows I would not be able to function with just 1/2 of my lungs.  His reason for removing the bottom lobe  is that it would not function in all that empty space.

							Can anyone help me understand a little more about tumor markers?  Last fall I had 4 treatments of A/C followed by 30 rads and now have completed 2 of 4 Taxotere.  The onc is extremely good about monitoring everying with blood test, WBC, etc each treatment which is reassuring.  I just learned that the onc has been  looking at tumor markers since the first treatment last fall and I was able to see the results.  In trying to help me understand, he indicated they like it to be below 39.  When I started first chemo I was at 27 then next blood count it was 35 and then has continually reduced now down to 14.  I've read all the reports and studies and understand that by itself tumor markers are not necessarily reliable but ""perhaps"" only an indicator of how successful treatment is.  And having looked at the studies I see it is only 50%+ accurate and can give false positives.  Knowing all that, perhaps the doctors can help me understand:
1)  what would have caused the spike from 27 to 35 in a two week time period from the time of first treatment to the second treatment -- would that be because the chemo started and basically ""disrupted"" all the cancer cells into a frenzy?
2)  if I was at 27 and now down to 14 does that indicate that at least the chemo treatment is working and doing what they expected and 
3)  is the idea to get it to 0 or just low and then to watch for a change upward that could indicate something in the future?

In any case, I take it as reassurance that the onc is watching and testing all things for my best treatment and it is a positive sign that things are progressing in the proper direction -- always looking for the encouragement to wake up to another beautiful day!

							Hi Marion,
I've written you 3 times and then deleted them.  TM's and oncos go from one extreme to the other.  A friend of mine before she had her biopsy, had the CA 27-29 done and it was normal, but she had a 9cm tumor and 11+ nodes.  Needless to say, they didn't do anymore tumor markers on her.   I think they are better at detecting reoccurences then initial dx.  I didn't have my 1st one until I was NED a year and my onco did them at each of my 3 month check ups for a year, to see what was normal for me.  My last one was in Oct. and my next one will now be in Oct.  I'm definately not a doc and I'll let one answer you with more definate answers but wanted to give you a little info that I learned based on my onco's views of TM.  He said he would not do any on me during treatment as so many things can cause false positives, as well as false neg. and with the chemo, which is obviously a foreign body going in, he just wouldn't do them.  The reason he waited a year was he wanted to be as sure as humanly possible that I was NED, then he could see what the norm was for me.  The labs they do, tell a big picture, more then I even realized until recently.  Of course the liver enzimes obviously keep an eye on the liver.  Calcium levels, tell a lot about the bones, as far as mets go.  Some oncos never do any TM.  Mine doesn't do the CEA because everything can cause those to go up and down.
I know easier said then done, because I freaked when mine went up 5 points and it was still in the low normal and the next time went back down.  I was running a fever and that's more then likely what caused the slight change, but to me it was a huge change since they had always been almost identical each time.  Try not to think about the TMs, especially at this point.  You're getting the chemo regimine that your onco feels is best for your type of cancer and radiation and getting good care.  I think a good onco is half the battle and it sounds like you've got one that is very good and truly cares about you as a person, not a number.  You're already considered NED because the obvious cancer is gone and this is to get any stray little suckers that might be floating around, so you're on your way and before long, you'll be celebrating your 1 year NED.  I don't know what is standard after treatment care, but mine did another CT Scan of my chest after treatment and a year later, did a bone scan (that was because I was hurting in places I hadn't hurt before) and that was fine.  The way mine told me was if my tumor markers went up and continued to go up, he'd start checking to see IF it meant the cancer was back somewhere and on the other hand, if I was having problems, like I did when my lower back hurt so bad, that I just knew I had bone mets (he said it was a disk) and even though the TMs were normal, he did an MRI of my lower back and it was a herniated disk thank God.  I hope this makes sense because I can confuse myself sometimes.....lol
Hang in their girl, you're doing great and before long, you'll be done with treatment and starting your new life after cancer.

							Hi, Nancy.  Thanks for the information.  To be honest, the TM are not a concern for me.  Just trying to understand what role they play.  I look at them as just another piece of the puzzle, and the more knowledge that I gain the more I'm in control of this battle.  It also offers me the ability to  ask intelligent questions of the onc.  I find the more knowledge I have and can ask relevant questions about my own treatment, the more likely he is to not treat me as a number.

							Hello

Tumor markers are well established for following prostate, colorectal and ovarian cancers. For breast cancers the tumor markers are not so well studies that they can be relied upon as it is with the above-mentioned tumors. That's why there is so much variation as to why some doctors follow them whereas others don't. 

Personally, I would rather not use them since it does not add any information, but some (including many that know much much more than I do) prefer to use it, so basically it is up to the particular physician.

She doesn't go to get regular checkups, and missed her 6 month checkup because section 8 wouldn't pay the bill for it.  Now there appears to be spreading to under the arm.

							Hi,
First thing is get to a surgeon and have your mom's lump removed and biopsied.  If it is cancer, she will have a choice of lumpectomy or mastectomy.  I was 43 when dx and I opted for a mastectomy, I wanted to make sure there were no lingering cancer cells in my breast.  When they do the lumpectomy/mastectomy, they will check her lymph nodes to see if it has spread there.  If they have gone to her nodes, it's not a death sentence nor does it mean that she won't respond well to treatment.  I had a 5.5 cm tumor, which is large (mammogram missed it and I had mine every year) and 9 positive lymph nodes out of 16 that were cancerous.  It's been over 3 years and I'm still NED (No evidence of disease) and there are MANY women that have positive nodes that do great.  They will, or should do a bone scan to make sure it hasn't gone to her bones, probably a CT Scan of the chest to make sure it's not a local matastises (sp) to her chest wall etc.  They will run a complete metabolic profile for her labs and this way they can tell if it has spread anywhere else in her body.  Since the lump has been there for 2 years, she needs to get it done now.  I have several friends in NY, but not that familiar with different areas, but I will ask them if they know of any cancer centers that they would recommend.  Right now the most important thing is get her to a surgeon and get that lump REMOVED and biopsied.  The only good lump is one in a jar.
Please feel free to e-mail me anytime and I'll let you know what my friends say in NY.  I know I'll talk to one later today and I'll call the other one.  They also know of other ladies in the general area who could hopefully also help, but again, you need to find out if it's cancer and get it out of her body.
I know you're scared, it's a scary disease, but again me and so many I know are doing great even with node involvement, one had all positive nodes and she is 7 years out, so try to relax until you know what's going on, but I wouldn't put it off since it's been there 2 years.  If it's cancer, it's continuing to grow.

Also talking to a medical oncologist before surgery is a good idea. Sometimes chemo can be done first to shrink tumors and lymph nodes before the surgery. If you can get a surgeon and oncologist to agree on a treatment plan, then it's a good sign.

Come to October 2004, my father noticed a swelling in his neck, he went back to this ""doctor"" who told him it was just a muscle and sent him home...3 WEEKS go by...my father started to get what his ""doctor"" said was acid reflux...sent him for a test where they put the tube down his throat with a camera to determine it was indeed Acid Reflux...they said he had VERY bad acid reflux (all of a sudden) and ever since they put that camera down his throat, he had his left vocal cord paralyzed...he went back to this ""doctor"" and my father very diligently demanded that he go to an Ear, Nose Throat Specialist...and this ""doctor"" said ""For what? the muscle? okay, if it will make you feel better....""  The ENT sent him for a CAT Scan...

The result of the CAT scan...Adenocarcinoma of the Lung  (Left Lung & Lymph Nodes) listed as Metastic Lung Cancer on the pathology report....STAGE IV....now he finally went to a reputable doctor who sent him for chemo....for 3 months he went and last week he went for a CAT Scan and PET Scan, it showed that the chemo did nothing, there are more tumors on his left lung and the ones he had grew dramatically...and it went to his liver (""innumerable masses"")

Can someone please help me?  Is it possible that it went from the Prostate to the Lung? that this doctor neglected to advise my father on the proper procedures?

I am really upset over this...I am the oldest of 4 children, and I am pregnant with my 2nd child...I am losing so much sleep over all of this.. My mother says that you can't go back in time, don't dwell on what we could have done...I just feel the ""doctor"" should have done more, maybe they would have caught this in time?  

He is only 52 years old (his father, my grandfather died from Lung, Brain Cancer 21 years ago)..I am scared that now it's just going to pass along to me and my 2 brothers and sister....I am so close with my Dad and it's killing me to see him like this...I am sorry if I am babbling, but I have been researching every day and night, trying to find some hope for a miracle or something that could work for him...My mom is so depressed, b/c she's seeing her husband waste away, he lost 60 lbs already...it's so sad...someone told me to get Milk Thistle for him....the doctor's are giving him Tarceva now, b/c the last chemo didn't work...he has to take pain killers in order to eat b/c of the pain in his stomach/side....I won't give up on trying to find some kind of hope for him.....can anyone help me?

I am sorry again for rambling like this...this is my first time I have ever posted anything....

							Christi620, I read your email with sadness and some empathy, I am 54 years old, a married man and have also been diagnosed with lung cancer and heart failure, I am terminally ill and have been told I have only a short time left.  I felt your post deserved some kind of response, even if it's not what you had hoped to hear, though I do hope you will try and get some comfort from this. 

From what you have said your Dad has been having a very hard time of things for a long time. It's possible his doctor could have been more vigilant, though it's always hard to say exactly what goes on when we are not party to the doctor patient relationship. 

Loosing a loved  one is always hard, but it can be that much harder for the families that have to deal with a terminal illness. Your desire to help in any way possible is an illustration of the love you have for your father and how the pain that he suffers is shared by you and your family. However you have choices, you can chose to use this time with your father as a time to say the things that need to be said, and to do the things that need to be done for your entire family or you can spend the time trying to find a cure or treatment that your current doctors should already be doing on your fathers behalf. 

No one would want to take any hope you have away from you or your family, but there is a level of denial that can become destructive, if your father has been diagnosed terminal, your time and efforts might be better placed in finding ways of making his last days memorable, if he believes you are in distress and he sees this, it can make his situation more difficult. We must remember, stress is contagious, and more stress is probably the last thing he needs. Even if you are doing your best to hide your stress, it's likely he will be aware of your feelings and pain. The best thing that many cancer suffers can be given is a sense of calm and peace, it's something I know I crave for on a bad day.  

There is a level of denial we need to find in order to deal with a terminal illness. Each of us have our own level but we can say that it should not extend to using the remaining time we have together on false hopes or additional disappointments. When we accept that death is a possibility we can then get on to those things that really matter. The denial should be in the thought that death cannot place it's cloud over us, in short we need to ignore it's presence in order that the love we have to give is not tainted by premature grief. 

Finding your own place of peace during these very hard times might be the best investment of time, I sure if you are at peace your father will feel this, and this will help him deal these hard times.


I wish you and your family well and hope you can find some peace and calm in your life.

							Dearest Christina,

I want you to know, as the mental health person on this site, loftus75 gave you sage and healthy advice.  I will only add a few things to the mix.  YOU need to take care to do all the wellness steps for a mother to be. This will save your father and mother any additional concern over YOUR immediate health. 

You have had a loss of faith in your father's early care (or lack) providers. You have had a loss of your personal peace of mind & ,in general, a loss of the comfort structure of your life. We grieve many changes  throughout our lives, many of which  have to do with our lives being turned upside down.  I get the sense that you feel as though you have had the ""wind knocked out of you"".  Following that, let me suggest that you check into a copy of James & Friedman; The Grief Recovery Handbook.  It is simply a bit of help with life. I have given it to many patients that  have loss and change happening and have had very positive feedback.

Please know that you were not ""rambling"", you just had a lot to say.

My Very Best,

							Dear Christina,

Thanks for sharing your story with us. While it is possible that prostate cancer metastasizes to the lung, it seems that the biopsies revealed lung cancer. Therefore your father unfortunately had a second cancer, which is totally separate from the prostate cancer. Unfortunately he did not respond to the initial chemotherapy regimen... still, I am glad he is under the care of a good physician. 

As Pat mentioned, please make sure you take care of yourself. We will be here if you need to talk, ok ?

							I am 8 months post double-mastectomy and looking forward to my reconstruction.  The PS said my pectoral muscles seemed thin and he wasn't sure how the implants will work on me.  He's not going to use tissue expanders, just implants.  My original surgeon left a lot of skin.  I am not a canidate for other surgical reconstruction options, only the implants.

My question is ... can you build up pectoral muscles?  Two PS have told me no but then you see these body builders with large pectoral muscles.  If weight lifting or some kind of exercise would improve my outcome I am happy to do it but having had two PS tell me the same thing ... I'm confused.

This is just from my personal experience with attempted reconstruction, but my pectorial (sp) muscle went into a constant spasm for 24 hours.  Let's just say I woke up for the 1st time in the recovery room and I wasn't the nicest person when asking for pain meds.  I am now very concaved (reconstruction failed big time) and I've cracked 3 ribs just from how tight the tissue is because the pectorial didn't bounce back.  I would think that if they could be built up, my PS would have had me doing something to accomplish that, because it's no better and that was over a year ago.  The only option I have now and they said there were no guarentees would be to have a bilateral LD Flap.  8 surgeries in 3 years, I'm done.  I have officially retired from being a surgery patient and I will be happy being boobless...... lol

							Thanks so much for mentioning that surgery.  I am aware of the abdominal and back surgeries that give you more natural feeling breasts.  Unfortunately. because of some previous surgery and my weight I am not a good canidate for the abdominal one and I have a handicapped sister who needs  occassional lifting and I don't want ot chance any suregery, such as the back one, that would hinder my ability to lift her if needed.

I had the reconstruction with the lat flap (the back surgery) and have no trouble lifting heavy objects. I continue to work with horses and regularly lift 50 pound bags of feed and heavy bales of hay. It does take a little time to work back up to the norm immediately following the surgery but long term effects have been minimal as far as my ability to lift things goes. Albeit, it does give a strange sensation that takes a little getting used to.

							Hi, I'm new to forums so not sure if this is right or not but i'm just looking for some general feedback, no diagnosis or whatever.
In late Jan i went to the docs cos i had symptoms of: blood/mucus in stool( lots of it and very dark), weight loss (hips and ribs are protruding),some constipation, not sure if its a lot cos ive suffered with that constantly since i was a baby, left side of my stomach absolutely doubles me over in pain, left knee hurts a lot and so does my left elbow.

After being sent to hospital in Feb the doc told me its possibly Crohn's and scheduled me for a colonoscopy, which i'm finally having on Wednesday.
Since Feb right up until the present day ive been suffering with the constipation that lasts for about 3 weeks then miraculously disappears for about a week then comes back full force again. Also, in the last week or so ive discovered a lump in my abdomen, it doesnt feel very big but it is noticeable, its just above my navel and over to the left slightly, not sure what this could be.

I'm not saying it could be Cancer cos i'm only 22yrs old, i realise how unlikely it is but i must admit, with the symptoms i have and the lump appearing i am getting quite worried and the thought has crossed my mind that i could have cancer. I'm probably being very silly for thinking like this, my mind is probably going lol.

My diet is fine, i'm quite picky like that, everything has to be right so i dont know, maybe it could do with changing but ive always eaten the same as i always have since i was little and i only started feeling ill in Jan.

Well, Thank you for taking the time to read this, Sorry its long, guess i needed to get that off my chest..Fingers crossed the colonoscopy will turn up some results on Wednesday and i will finally know what im battling. Thanks Again

							Hi, My father-in-law was diagnosed with throat cancer in Oct.  He was not a candidate for surgery, but had chemo and radiation. (He is 67 years old).  The tumor was 5cm and too close to his aorta.  At that time, 2 spots were noticed on his lungs.  Drs. said if it was cancer, the chemo would get it.  Jan. - treatments were finished.  Scans repeated.  Throat cancer gone (they think), but spots still on lungs.  Drs. comfortable watching.  A couple of weeks ago, he went for more scans, and was told he has 10 new lesions on his lungs. and that he has an aggressive form of non small cell stage 4 lung cancer.  Months to live.  He has not bounced back from his chemo that ended Jan. 1.  Sleeps most of the time.  Has next to no energy.  Has had GI tube from the beginning and is still unable to take food by mouth.  He has lost a good bit of weight.    He is to start Tarceva this week.  
We have no idea what to expect.... should we get hospice? will this really improve the quality of his life?  if he is still smoking, is it worth taking meds? what is the median survival rate for this type of cancer?  

The throat doctor told him not to worry, he is not on his death bed.  While we hope this is true, we want to be prepared for what the future holds.

They are not good at asking questions or allowing people to go to the dr. with them.  They fear being an inconvenience.  We want to help.

I know this is a lot of questions, any you can answer will be much appreciated.

One more, he has had a low grade fever for the last week.  Always below 99.5.  Is this something we should be worried about?

Thanks, Cindy
						

"
"


							Dear Cindy,

Usually metastatic lung cancer has a poor prognosis as you probably know, but the one of the most important things is how he is doing in general, how mobile he is, if he needs assistance for his daily activities, etc.

Hospice is something that people can use to provide comfort. If he is still on active treatment for his cancer then hospice is probably not the best option right now. If he can quit smoking it would help to clear his lungs, as smoking impairs that ability to clear secretions, and therefore infections are more likely to happen if one is smoking.

Also, fevers are always a concern. He has multiple risk factors for infections, so he should seek medical attention for his fevers.

best regards,

							Researchers at The University of Texas M. D. Anderson Cancer Center have developed a way to test whether the new targeted therapy Tarceva and the widely used chemotherapy drug Taxol are effectively killing tumor cells. They say that with further refinement, the test may make it possible to accurately assess whether patients are responding to these agents, as well as potentially others, within days of beginning therapy.

							Hello Pat,

At diagnosis I was given the understanding that chemotherapy is used to delay recurrence and reduce the number of recurrences, but in essence does not extend survival. My interpretation of this is that most breast cancer survivors will eventually have recurrence with or without chemo. My first question is, is that understanding basically correct, or not?

Cancer doesn't scare me half as much as chemo does. I completed the chemo recommended for me and am NED and over 2 years out, but continue to be ""stuck"" about chemotherapy. When I asked my oncologist questions before doing chemo he avoided answering them, telling me that ""it was academic"". Prior to chemotherapy I never was given any information about recurrence or survival percentages as they applied to me.

I started out with a surgeon who advertises herself as a ""breast care specialist"" but failed to follow up on me and compounded that by not even reviewing her own clinic notes when I called her to try to get her to biopsy me. I don't even feel dislike for her; I just feel she doesn't know her job well enough to be doing it.

I am inspired by the dedication and integrity of some of the doctors I work with, but out of the 5 doctors I had at time of diagnosis not one of them (even the ones with female breasts) said anything at all about chemopause. They just said that it was likely I would go through menopause because I was over 50. Why on earth wouldn't any of these people that I feel some real love and respect for, provide any pre-chemo couseling at all for that? The youngest female one actually said to me ""Well, the average age of menopause is 52 so you are going to go through it anyway.""  How can I get back to feeling confidence in what they know and what they advise me to do? I'm ER+PR+ so they are recommending an aromatase inhibitor for me. But both my internist and my onc simply stare at me when I want them to help me deal with chemopause, which started for me within 2 weeks after I followed their recommendation and started tamoxifen. In fact, my onc actually laughed at me when I said that I'd heard it causes vaginal dryness, and said that it does not. 

I feel like they are the ones who need the reality check. Do you have any comments?
						

"
"


							Hello there,

You do not need the reality check!  You are right faith in your proffessional team is very important. There is a book by Greg Anderson called, 50 Essential Things  to Do.  I suggest that you give it a try.  You should be an active and equal part of your team, treated with seriousness and respect.  If you have trouble reminding them of this underline passages in the book that apply and take it with you.  Give a chance for all  of you to work this out.  If not, remember they should be working with you and for you.  Many people have needed to replace team members because it simply was just not healthy.

Any of your medical questions can be addressed by either one of both Dr. Leo & Dr. Jay.

Try, to make one calm, complete statment of your concerns and ask if they can provide that, then do what you need for your health and peace of mind. Let me know what you decide. I am here for you.


Best of Luck.

							Hi Alaska Angel...  I agree with you that there needs to be more counseling support as we go throught this process!!  I was 39 when I was diagnosed, and honestly, being told I would go into menopause (chemopause) was shocking and devastating for me.  I was not prepared to hear this, and given no support in processing this bit of info and major change in my fertility status!!   I was childless and single.  This was a big deal.  And no, I did not go into menopause afterall, and still have my monthly periods.

You asked for comments...  My best advice would be to find another oncologist and internist.  One who has compassion and has a clue about the symptoms of menopause (vaginal dryness being near the top of the list after hot flashes!)  I,  too, would have trouble putting my confidence in these people.  Medical skill aside, their ""bedside"" manner needs some work.  I am so sorry to hear you encountered such insensitivity during such a difficult time!!  Hope by now you've found some support around the chemopause symptoms!!

							Hi Alaska,
 This is the first time I read the coping and support posting.  
I think I have found that I need more support now than I did two years ago.  I have some doctor issues too and one of them is about the chemopause like you.  Also as you may remember reading in previous posts of mine in the bc room that my HER2+++ was never even mentioned to me.  Another issue I have is why the heck they don't inform you of lymphedema?????  I found that every time I tried to address lymphedema they all totally disregarded my feelings.  I wanted to know what I can do to PREVENT it...blah blah blah..
Ok back to chemopause.,...I am 43 and went into it after starting chemo...ok so no period and some hot flashes...but then they also forgot to tell me that because of my age I could get my period back...and I DID...so where does that leave me now....it leaves me in limbo in premenopausal state of not knowing when my period is going to come and go.  Also nobody seems to really be able to answer the question about getting your period back and our concerns being ER and PR positive???
OK...sorry I have some issues....didn't mean to rant!! LOL
I think part of the problem is that at the time of dx and surgery and chemo ...you really don't have the time to stop and think and you really don't know what questions to ask.  I think there are a lot of good books, but you really don't have time read them at the time of dx...
I am reading a really good book now...Life After Breast Cancer..(I think)  I am trying to get on with my life, but it is tough!!!

I'm in remission but I had cervical cancer.  My treatments were Chemo, Radiation, and 2 radium implants.  I've had complications because of the Radium Implant.  I used a dialator for awhile until the pain became unbarable.  I went to the hospital and the pain was caused from the scar tissue.  So I was then put on some powerful pain medication  that ACTUALLY WORKED(Oxycontin 20mg).  After 2 or so years I'm back in pain once again.  I know it's source---the scar tissue is on a nerve therefore UNBARABLE PAIN.  I've asked my doc what could we do about this and he told me there was just one more thing that could be done but it was VERY DANGEROUS.  The solution is cutting the nerve.  He told me that he wasn't sure any doc would touch me considering I'm 36 yrs old and my history with cancer AND I'd have to wear a bag or diapers because that nerve controls the bladder and the bowel.  I'm SOOOO FRUSTRATED and SOOOOO UPSET!!  I feel helpless because noone has given me any other alternatives PLUS I want to get off the pain medication.  When the pill wears off I feel HORRIBLE!  I don't know what to do PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE can ANYONE help me or even direct me to someone who can give me answers???  THANK YOU SO MUCH for taking the time to read my topic!!

							Hello

I feel sorry for what you've been going through. While medications can help, sometimes the only way is really to cut the nerves. Another more recent strategy has been a spinal cord stimulator, that is a device that can control pain in people that have no better options. While this may not be offered by the physicians in your case, I think it might be worth to ask about.

							Hi. I recently heard about a nationwide study opening for patients in pain related to or associated with cancer. To participate, you must be between the ages of 18 and 80, experience an average of 1-4 flares of pain per day.  These flares of pain are commonly called breakthrough pain.  You also need to be taking daily opioid medication to control your regular/persistent pain.  Some examples of opioid medications are below:

?	Morphine
?	Transdermal Fentanyl
?	Hydrocodone
?	Oxycodone
?	Hydromorphone

							I recently was having some abdominal pain in the center of my abdomen as well as slightly elevated liver function tests.  My doctor said if it would make me feel better, he'd have a CT scan run.  On the CT scan they found a tiny (3mm) lesion on my liver that they couldn't characterize but statistically considered a cyst.  The lesion was undoubtedly accidentally found and nothing to do with my pain which has since subsided.

But, how do I know it's not the beginning of a tumor.  Are cysts dramatically different in appearance than tumors on a CT scan?  The doctor said he didn't see any reason to worry, but should I insist on a follow-up CT and if so how soon?  Or are there other tests that would be prudent?

							Protective effects of calcium on colorectal polyps persist

ANAHEIM, California (Reuters Health) - The protective effects of calcium supplementation on colorectal polyps appears to persist for up to 5 years after people stop taking the supplements, according to a study presented this week at the 96th annual meeting of the American Association for Cancer Research. 

""There is ample epidemiological and experimental data suggesting the a high intake of calcium may decrease the risk of colorectal cancer,"" Dr. John A. Baron from Dartmouth Medical School in Lebanon, New Hampshire said during a briefing with reporters.

In 1999, data from the Calcium Polyp Prevention Study involving 930 adults randomized to placebo or 1200 milligrams calcium daily for 4 years showed a 20% reduction in the risk of all colorectal adenomas with calcium supplementation. At the AACR meeting, Dr. Baron reported data on 822 of the original subjects who were followed for at least 5 years after the end of the treatment phase.

""Within the 5 years after the end of randomized treatment, there was a marked effect of the initial treatment assignment on hyperplastic polyps and all adenomas,"" Dr. Baron reported. 

After adjusting for the use of calcium supplements after the primary study was over, there was a 41% reduction in the risk of hyperplastic polyps and a 35% reduction in risk of all adenomas during the first 5 years after the study. ""These were more pronounced reductions than were seen during the treatment phase,"" Dr. Baron said. 

This reduction in risk did not persist beyond 5 years since cessation of active treatment. 

These data, Dr. Baron said, indicate that ""calcium is effective in reducing the risk of colorectal adenomas and, after the end of the supplementation, there is no rebound in risk at all. In fact there appears to be a delayed more pronounced suppression of colorectal neoplasia during the 5 years after treatment.""

							I am 49 y/o and  have Stage IIA breast Ca diagnosed 12/04 with a routine yearly mammogram. Had  bilat mastectomies 1/05. Results: 1 cm, E+, P+, 2 sentinel nodes +, 22 axillary nodes negative, HER/neu negative. Started dose-dense cehmo with A/C 1/26. On second dose had fever and cellulitis around expander, so was cancelled, hospitalized anf given antibiotics, all cultures negative. Had 2nd dose and it was changed to FEC. I went for second opinions and was told to stick to dose dense. Well, after FEC I had to wait 21 days for the second dose-dense (which really would be the third total dose of chemo). Had 2 more A/c every two weeks with Neulasta and EPO support. Normal ECHO after A/C. Had Taxol #1 on 4/6 and was told not to do Neulasta because my WBC was 8.8 with ANC 7.9. A week after Taxol my WBC was 2.5 with ANC 1.69. Went for Taxol #2 but was postponed bec WBC was 1.0 and ANC 0.56 (monocytes 0.14). At this point I am not sure that bI ever really received dose-dense chemo and it does upset me some as it may lead to a lower response rate and cure rate.
Also, the oncologist told me that my initial CA 27-29 was in the upper levels of normal. I went to 40, then 52 and then back to 44. He repeated it today and wants to do a bone scan if it goes up again. I have been on Prozac 40 mg since the diagnosis of ca in 12/04. I also take MVI, Calcium, Bcomplex, Folic Acid (hx of colon ca in family), B6, Coumadin and Sonata.

I would appreciate some advice, opinions and suggestions as I am quite concerned.

							Hi,
Onco's have different opinions of CA 27-29 because of their unreliability.  I never got my 1st one until I was 1 year NED (No Evidence of Disease) and he did them every 3 months at my check ups for 1 year to see what was ""normal"" for me.  The last one I had was in Oct. and I won't have another one now until Oct.  A friend of mine had the CA27-29 done prior to her biopsy and it was in the normal range, but she had a 9cm tumor and 11 positive nodes.  Some oncos never do tumor markers and some put a lot of faith in them.  Mine checked them again to see what was normal for me once I was done with treatment and NED, but if I have pain somewhere that doesn't go away, even if my tumor markers are normal, he's going to trust what my body is saying over them.  On the other hand, if my tumor markers start going up and continue to go up, he'll start running scans to see if anything is going on.  My onco also did a CT Scan of the chest, chest x-ray and bone scan before I started treatment to see if it had spread to any place else, and of course mega bloodwork.  Did you have a bone scan prior to starting chemo?

I was given FEC for 6 treatments and I'm 3 years out and as you can tell by my bio, I was Stage III.  I go to a cancer institute where all the oncos get together and discuss all the new patients and decide what treatment they feel will work best on the individual person and the kind of BC they have.

This whole disease is very confusing to say the least.  I had labs done 2 weeks after chemo to see if my white count was rebounding because they expect it to bottom out, but want to make sure they can rebound on their own, if not, there are shots they give, like you took to boost the white count.  I then got labs again before my next chemo to make sure my counts were back to where they should be.  I never had to take any shots because mine bottomed out, but not lower then expected and then came back up on their own.  Some ladies have to get the shots with every treatment.  Some oncos give the shots whether you need them or not.  Mine only gave them if needed.

I don't know if I helped you at all, but a lot of this is what the onco feels will work best for you.  If you have doubts or don't feel 100% confident that you're getting the best care possible, I would get a 2nd opinion.  You really do have to be your own advocate when it comes to this disease and your health.  It's your life and usually what your gut says, I would go with.

I was told my mammogram was normal, no signs of cancer and my ultra sound showed B9 cysts.  I had no idea that they couldn't tell if something was B9 or not without a biopsy.  I knew I felt a lump/mass and my gut said something wasn't right.  I went with my gut and say a surgeon.  It wasn't what I wanted to hear, but thank God I went with my gut, since I was already Stage III and only 43.

If I can help at all, please feel free to e-mail me anytime.
Take care and kick some cancer butt

							Hello

While CA-27-29 can be used, the guidelines published by the American Society of Clinical Oncology do not recommend using it yet, since there is not enough data available to indicate that this markes is useful. As a matter of fact, there are studies showing that there were patients whose markers started to go up, by there were no metastases. This is an area where there is a lot of research effort, so that we hopefully can detect recurrence earlier and with that achieve better outcomes.

							Thank you for the replies. The new marker was 47 and they want less than 37, so I will be getting a bone scan. I am pretty scared. He did tell me to wean myself off the Prozac because I asked him if it could be contributing to the levels. It is easier said than done because it does help me cope. I may need a different type.
No, I didn't have any bone scans or CT scans. I was puzzled but I called a friend t Memorial Sloan Kettering in New York and she told me that they also don't do them in early stages. I can't help but think about the cases discovered because of distant mets but not because of breast massses...
I will follow the recommendations and take it from there. It's all very frightening.

							Hi Mia,
I know easier said then done, but remember that alot of onco's don't do CA27-29 at all and alot  more of them don't do them while you're getting treatment because they aren't reliable, moreso during treatment then after.  
I would definately ask for something else to help you get through this.  My onco put me on Paxil which helped a lot and effexor is another popular one that ladies are put on.
I've never heard of someone not getting a bone scan, CT Scan and all those prior to starting treatment so they can stage you correctly, if for no other reason, but that's another reason we all stay confused is because things are done so many different ways, depending on where you go.
If you are able to see the screen as the bone scan is being done, degenerative (sp) chances, arthritis and other things will light up on the screen, so don't panic if you see those.  The radiologist will read it and he knows what to look for.  The tech that did mine saw me quietly freaking out during it and told me what I saw weren't mets.  They aren't suppose to do that, but my sanity was extremely grateful.  Also, since you've never had one, more then likely if anything shows up like degenerative chances, the radiologist to cover his butt will say something like it doesn't appear to be mets but the only way to rule them out is a PET Scan.  He has nothing to compare this one to, so he'll have to say something like that, they did on mine.  I've had 2 other ones and on those the radiologist said, no signs of mets period, because he had the ones before to compare.
I really feel that you're going to be fine and it's just false readings because you're going through treatment.  I know that doesn't help since it's you that's so scared, but all of us have been there so we do understand.
We're here anytime you need us.  Remember, you're talking to a Stage III 5.5 cm tumor w/ 9+ nodes out of 16 and the cancer hadn't spread anywhere else prior to treatment and I'm 3+ years out with no signs of it being back

							Thank you Nancy and Leo. I am devastated today because I went for Taxol #2 and my WBC was 1.2 but my ANC dropped to 0.2. Now I am on Levaquin for protection against infections.
I am also puzzled because after the first Taxol, which is not supposed to drop your white counts, I was told not to do Neulasta (my WBC was 8.8 and my ANC was 7). A week later they had plummeted to WBC 2.5 and ANC 1.7 I asked about Neupogen but they thought I would recover by myself. Well, it is obvious I didn't. Now they tell me that Neupogen is contraindicated and I have to wait til the BM recovers by itself. So, I am truly upset bec supposedly this is dose-dense and it should be given every two weeks. This is the second time I have had to go to the third week. What will this do to my chances of response and cure? I am crying as I write this. I have two small children 3 and 9...sorry
Any reassuring thoughts, besides all you have given me?

							Hi Mia,
I'm sorry you're having such a rough time.  Have you considered a 2nd opinion?  We are in such an emotional roller coaster with this disease as it is, but it seems like you are being put on an extra long one.
There isn't a cure for BC, but treatments sure can make us stay with NED, which is great until a cure comes along.  I honestly don't think that it will make a difference in the success rate of your treatment by having to skip a week, many do.
I'm confused as to why they are saying they can't give you the shot to boost your white count?  I never had one, so I don't know a lot about them, but many ladies have to get the shots and some even get them for days prior to their next chemo or before their chemo.
It's hard enough emotionally and physically to go through this without all this added confusion.  I think I'd seriously consider a 2nd opinion and see if there is someone else, outside that practice that makes me feel more at ease and more confident in your treatment.
I'm hear anytime, just an e-mail away.
Hugs

							I really, trully appreciate your help because I don't know where to turn. I am angry and upset because I had the silly Neulasta shot in my refrigerator two weeks ago and believed them when they said that most patients (over 80%) don't need it. But a week later my counts were much lower, red flag as far as I am concerned. And now there is nothing we can do. I accepted the dose dense convinced that everything would be done to preserve the every two week treatments. I have two small children and I will do whatever it takes to be alive, no matter what the effects, fatigue, bone pain I don't care. They wanted to save me from more bone pain and from another shot. But I am not sure this is what Memorial Sloan Kettering had in mind with dose-dense. They are pretty aggressive.
I am seriously thinking of changing doctors but I wanted to dothis after the chemo and not make hasty decisions during it. Nothing I can do about this episode now.
What do you think?

							You can always get a 2nd opinion without leaving the onco you are with now.  I'd check and see who other people used regardless of what kind of cancer they may have had and get a referral that way.  Word of mouth is usually the best way to go.  If you can't find anyone, look and see who else in your area has oncologists and make an appt.  You can have a copy of all your records faxed over there and no doctor should have a problem with you getting a second opinion.  If they do, then that to me would be a red flag.  You have to be an advocate in your own health care and like me and most of us, you'll do whatever it takes to give you the best possible chance of never having to deal with this beast again.  Just my opinion but as upset as you are, I don't think you will rest until you get a 2nd opinioin and that is definately your decision.  I have no doubt if I wasn't completely satisfied in the care and treatment I was getting, I would have gotten a 2nd opinion.  Friends referred me to my onco, plus I had heard a lot about him, and it was all good and in a city this big, that made me feel good.  Him being head of oncology at the cancer institute made me feel good too.  I always felt that he had my best interest and he was determined for me to be a survivor.  I know there are no guarentees and never were, but if mine comes back, I know it's not because of anything he did or didn't do and that to me is the way everyone should feel about someone who's treating them for something as serious as cancer.
Hugs and prayers and keep me posted.

							I also feel that a second opinion sounds like the best option for you.  I had dose dense chemo a year ago, and my onc said from the start that in order to do dose dense you need the Neulasta shot the day after chemo to bring your counts back up in time for the next treatment.  Mine did bottom out in the 1-1.5 range, but were always back up by the second week for the treatment.  I was surprised to hear that some people get through dose dense on their own without the boosters.  Also don't understand why your dr says it's too late now to start with the boosters.  It's clear you need some more definitive answers to your questions, and if your present dr won't give them to your satisfaction, seeing someone else is your right.  Good luck!

							Dr. Leo - you have been very kind in the past answering my queries about a long ropey lump I found in the breast where I had invasive ductal cancer. I was seen this week by the Breast Care Centre where I was initially diagnosed - a surgeon, a radiographer, a radiologist and finally by the Director of the Centre herself, a Consultant Radiologist. Her opinion, after doing mammogram and ultrasound is that I have a thrombophlebitis in my upper breast, caused by radiotherapy. It has only taken some 9 months to get this seen but I am so relieved now that it is not a recurrence of cancer. Thank you for being there for all of us with cancer.

							Greetings to all breast cancer survivors and friends! 

I have posted photos at www.fotki.com/BCSurvivor so that other women with breast cancer can see what breast reconstruction looks like. Hey, don't get frightened, it's not finished yet! It is a work in progress. 

I know that to those of you who are not intimately familiar with the process, the sight of a breast without a nipple is a shock. Try to see beyond that. 

I had a mastectomy on March 3, 2004 with expander reconstruction at the same time, at age 50. I then had dose dense chemotherapy (4 A/C, 4 Taxol, every 2 weeks) which ended July 1, 2004, and 28 radiation treatments (ended September 2, 2004). On November 22, 2004, I had surgery to replace the saline expander with a silicone implant. 

At this point, even though it is not perfect, I am quite pleased with what I have and my progress to date. In a bra, my breasts look symmetrical and even. The silicone implant feels soft to the touch, and I don't feel it in my body. My scar is great - thin and fading (I have used scar gel religiously throughout the whole process). I am 51 now, and small, just 5 feet. I will be a B cup on both sides once this is all done, and the silicone implant is about 220 cc's. 

I am going to have additional surgery, probably in Fall of 2005, for breast symmetry. The surgeon will do an uplift/reduction to the real breast, and use the extra skin to fashion a nipple on the implant side. In addition, he will replace the existing silicone implant with a slightly smaller one, which should give me a better size match with the real breast, and also give me less volume on the top of the breast. He will also do some contouring, to improve the shape. 

Please note that the shape of the implant breast changes over time, as the implant ""settles in"". 

To all my breast cancer sisters, who now belong to this club that none of us wanted to join, I wish good healing, and long life. May we all live to be little old ladies with the best looking breasts in the senior center!

							Hi Rachel,
I tried the bilateral expanders and never got past that, too much radiation damage and the tissue wouldn't expand.  Matter of fact, when the surgeon went in to remove some of the damaged tissue, the expander was trying to push itself back out of my chest near the sternum area.  The PS's around here have all but refused to do expander/implants for those who have had to have radiation.
I didn't look until now when you were worried that it looked bad, since I had it done.  I'm happy that it worked for you and I think they did a great job.  Hope that makes you feel better.  
Nancy

							Dear Nancy,

I'm so sorry the expanders were such a nightmare for you.  That sounds painful and depressing.  

I see that you had radiation before your most recent bc, and before your expanders were put in.  MY PS won't do put in expanders after radiation, because of the same thing that happened to you - he says he never gets good results.   I had the expanders done at mastectomy time and all filled before my radiation (chemo was first) , so I was already stretched fully for 5 months when I had the radiation. 

Are you going to have any other reconstruction done?  My PS says that I could have a flap operation (don't remember if he said lat or tram or if both were possible) now, after radiation, if I wanted.  So if you want, that's a possibility for you.  I'm happy with what I have for now.
						

"
"


							Don't say most recent dx of BC, I've had only one and I pray it's the only one........    With as much that's in my bio, I'm sure it looked like it had to be more then one, but I ramble in even them..... lol

'No, I'm done with reconstruction unless they come up with a less invasive way to do it.  I've had 8 surgeries, 6 were connected to the BC/mastectomies and the attempted reconstruction, one from, more then likely the Arimidex and the other is questionable.  I tore the ligament (sp) completely in my wrist, but didn't have any kind of injury or accident that would have caused that much damage.  So not sure if chemo, Arimidex weakens the muscles and ligaments too or if I'm just that lucky...... lol

If I could do it over, I would have seen a PS before my mastectomy, but at the time I was dx on a Thur. Valentine's Day, went to an out of town surgeon that I wanted to do the MRM on Monday and had the MRM on Thur., so not much time to think, which was good for me.  

Who knows what else they will have in a couple of years.  I told myself if I made it the 5 years, which I plan on  then I might consider trying again, but definately not until then.  I've retired as a professional surgery patient..... lol  My last one I had prior to BC is when I was 3 and it was my tonsils.   I don't do anything in moderation.......UGH

Your PS really did do a good job.  I think I got up to 200CC and had to have saline removed after that, so I can see by just what I had that ours looked alike, you just had more and it worked.  Congrats!!!!!!!!!!!!

							I went to the site and posted but I'm never sure posts get where they are intended to go.

I for one appreciated your sharing the photos. I am going to have implants (this suregeon doesn't recommend expanders for me) this summer.  I've been to 3 PS.  The first two were going to use expanders.  The first one failed to provide the expanders at the time of my bilateral mastecomies (they went missing).  The second PS was more into the asthetics and made me feel like I would end up with good results but alas, my insurance wouldn't cover him (off plan) and I couldn't afford the 10K ou of pocket.  This PS wants to go ahead with implants to create ""mounds""  I was intrigued by how different physicians practice, both in procedures and in the way they present things to a patient.  I am a nurse and can usually get past personalities but since my dx I guess I'm  al ittle more sensitive than I used to be.  

Hopefully I will have surgery within the next couple of months. In the meantime I am mostly ok with the prothesis.  I am going with my sister to a spa this weekend.  I am anxious about getting into a bathing suit to go into the jacuzzi.  My prothesis aren't made for hot water, nor does my suit have pockets to hold them.  I guess I'll just put on a tee over my suit .  Unfortunately I am not a small person and not having breasts to counter the rest of my body makes me look pregnant.  Working on the stomach but have a way to go.  I read  an article called inner cleavage recently and it really gave me a kick in the pants ( was feeling sorry for myself).  I gave up my breasts for life...now I am going to live it and be thankful I can.

							Hey everybody!  My mom went today and found out about what kind of chemo she'll be getting.  They recommend AC Taxol.  They say it will last 5-6 months and have treatments every 2 weeks.  But, last time we went, they said it would last 12-16 weeks and she will get treatment every 3 weeks. We're confused.  Has anyone had this type of chemo.  I know its pretty aggressive
If anyone has any information on this or experiences, please let me know.  She will be starting it in about 2 weeks.

							Hi Danielle, 
I cannot answer all of yuor concerns.  But I will be starting the same chemo protocol on May 11th.  Sounds to me that she is getting ""dose-dense"" treatments, meaning more aggressive.  AC every 2 weeks for 4 treatments and then Taxol every 2 weeks for 4 treatments.  16 weeks total treatment time.
I would like to hear from you as to your moms progress and how she handles the treatments.  I am scared, as I am sure she is too.  But everyone here says you can make it through fine.  So I am relying on their support.
I will be following chemo with radiation therapy and then Tamoxifen for 5 years.  I am premenopausal amd drs. talk about stopping the ovaries from producing estrogen during the Tamoxifen use either by meds, surgery to remove, or radiation.  Has anyone out there had this done???

							I just wanted to let you know that shortly after I finished my chemo, which was different then AC/T, studies showed that there was a higher success rate with giving the AC/T every 2 weeks with weaker doses of the chemo, then every 3 weeks with full strength of the chemo and that was 3 years ago.  Mine, is still given every 3 weeks, probably because I got 3 at the same time.  So, since ya'll have been dx, they have made progress on finding better treatments   Everyone responds to chemo different, where one may have nausea, someone else won't.  I think fatigue is a given with any chemo, but don't assume it's going to be rough, because it may be easier on you then someone else and I pray it goes easy and I KNOW ya'll will do great through treatment.

							I cannot add any more to the first very comprehensive post, esp bec I have not finished with Taxol yet. I got some excellent nausea med called EMEND. I literally had no nausea, no queaziness, no vomiting. The fatigue of course was there for days 3 and 4 after AC. After the Tazol it was day 4 and 5. I also took Vitamin B6 and Tonic water in case of neuropathy, none so far.
I drink a ton of fluids. The only liquid I can tolerate is boiling water with some dried SunMaid fruits that I get at the supermarket. It comes out not too sweet and not just watery taste. It keeps me going. SOmetimes I add some OJ with pulp really cold.

							Hi, Danielle.  I did the A/C and now doing the Taxotere.  The two weeks vs three weeks is simply a difference of what they call dose dense treatment.  The every two week regimen has been shown to be more effective and aggressive than doing the three week regimen.

During A/C I did extremely well -- very little nausea because I had some great nausea meds. I was able to take a treatment on Wednesday afternoon, relax around the house on Thursday and by Friday felt good enough to go shpping.  Everyone is different but it is extremely doable.  I found small snacks helped with the nausea.  Your mom won't feel like eating but it will help get through the nausea, and drink plenty of liquids.  for me it felt like coming down with the flu but after 2 days it was better.  Your mom can do this.

After the 4 treatments of A/C, I did 30 radiation treatments and now doing 4 treatments of Taxotere.  I have no nausea at all with Taxotere but tremendous joint pain that starts on about day 2 and lasts for 2 days and then gone.  I have had no neuropathy.  While the pain is exhausting, there is light at the end of the tunnel.

Keep your mom focused on the success of the treatment and the fact that meds are so much better now than they used to be.  All of the women here are winning this battle and your mom can too.  Treatment goes fast.  Your mom just have to mentally prepare herself.  The more control she feels she has the better she will do. She already has you to support her and that's one of the most important things to have.  Good luck.  Our thoughts and prayers are with you and your mom.

							I'll just add my 2 cents...

I did the Ac portion and am doing the Taxol now.  The AC made me really sick the first treatment but they changed my nausea meds and the following times were much better.  I had 4 treatments, 2 weeks apart, with a Neulasta shot the day after each treatment.  I did feel really rundown for about 4-5 days beginning the 2nd day after treatment....so, I was a couch potato for a few days.  Also, some foods that I really liked tasted horrible to me...ie. chocolate and beef.  I did well with bland foods...potatoes and jello were staples for me during that time.  My hair started falling out after 2 weeks.  It's not so bad...much easier to get ready to go somewhere.  My white counts never dropped.

I am now doing the Taxol...I'm having 1 treatment a week for 6 weeks and 3 more every other week.  I'm also having 34 rads.  I have had 3 Taxol so far and I have not noticed any side effects to speak of.  I do get rosy cheeks and a red nose for a couple of days...but I've not had any problems with nausea, fatigue or numbness in my hands and feet.

I'ts not terribly fun but it is very ""doable.""  Just tell your mom to take it easy when she feels bad and let others wait on her.  Also, call the doctor if she has nausea...they have other meds they can try.  Try to look for positives....every time I went for an AC treatment, I dreaded it big time...but I just kept telling myself that I'm one closer to being done.

Good luck!!

Thanks for responding.  I let my mom read what you guys wrote, and I think it makes her feel much better about things.  So how long is your total treatment time?  They told my mom it would be about 5-6 months.  Is yours that long, or anybody's??
I hope you are doing well.  That is great that your body has responded so well to the chemotherapy!

							I started dose dense chemo Jan 23 04 with AC, my last taxol on Apr 29 04, then rads--last treatment July 1 04, so my chemo was just under 4 months, including rads made it almost 6 months.  I was pleased with the time table, as my daughter's wedding was Sept 25 04 and was a weekend long affair on Mackinac Island, MI which we'd been planning well before my dx.  I was feeling great and pretty much back to my old self by then.

Good luck to all of you!

							Hi, my name is David Gaudreau. The following text briefly describes The Cause. 

On April 18th 2005 my mother was diagnosed with cervical cancer. This is one of the hardest moments of my life. Mom needs surgery, but has only Mass Health. Mass Health will only cover 1/4 of the $10,000 surgery. Also, they only cover 1/2 of the hospital stays for patients, which in this case will accumulate to somewhere around $4,000. I need to somehow raise $9,500 for her surgery to take place. I am hoping, and now, for the first time in my life, praying that your kind hearts will donate the monies needed to save the life of a wonderful woman who has done so many things and sacrificed so much for her children.

I appreciate, with all my heart, every penny you can spare. NO amount is too little to give to save a life!

							Does anybody know if there are any contraindications to the use of Neupogen once your counts are low?
I got Taxol two weeks ago and was told not to do the Neulasta because my counts were good. A week later they had dropped (from 8.8 to 2.5 and my ANC from 7 to 1.6). I was told that I would probably recover by myself but this week when I was supposed to get Taxol #2 they plummeted to 1 and ANC of 0.5. Now he says that Neupogen is contraindicated and that the BM has to recover by itself. Well, I am supposed to be on dose-dense every two weeks. Aren't they supposed to keep me on Neulasta no matter what??
I would like to see other experiences before O change doctors. I am getting tired.
Thanks

							Mia,

I don't know anything about the workings of it, but I had dose dense also, and had 7 neupogen shots after each of the first 7 chemos, and a Neulasta shot after the last one. (my doc gives only neupogen if there is only 2 weeks in between, won't give neulasta).  I had my blood counts done each chemo day and once the day after the last neupogen each time (day 11), and my counts were fine each time.  

Perhaps you can do a google search on Neupogen/neulasta and contraindications.  Or easier, grill your doc, and get a second opinion.  I cannot understand why they would not give you the neupogen after a chemo, even if your counts were ok, since it's afterwards that they plummet.
						

"

							Hello

Well, Neupogen and Neulasta are a bit different, but are essentially designed to stimulate the bone marrow to produce white cells. Neulasta is a newer drug that tends to work for longer periods of time. Anyway, there are concerns that this type of drugs could stimulate certain cancers, but these theories are yet unproven. For that reason, oncologists are careful prescribing it. There are side-effects and risks associated with it.

Here are the guidelines published in 2001 by the American Society of Clinical Oncology





			
				Concomitant chemotherapy and radiation ? Use of CSFs should be avoided in patients receiving concomitant chemotherapy and radiation, particularly involving the mediastinum; the primary reason is a higher incidence of thrombocytopenia [35]. For patients receiving radiation therapy involving large fields but no chemotherapy, therapeutic use of CSFs may be considered if prolonged delays secondary to neutropenia are expected.

Secondary prophylaxis ? Secondary prophylaxis refers to the administration of a CSF in later cycles after febrile neutropenia has occurred in a prior cycle. The goal is to maintain chemotherapy dose intensity when dose reduction is not desired. No published regimen has shown improved disease-free or overall survival when the dose of chemotherapy was maintained and secondary prophylaxis was instituted. Except in the setting of curable tumors (eg, germ cell cancer), dose reduction after an episode of severe neutropenia should be considered the primary therapeutic option.
			
		






Bottomline is: there is no clear indication for Neulasta unless there is fever in the context of neutropenia, i.e. when your ANC is <1.0

							Yikes,  now I am worried.  I received dose dense A/C and Taxol for 16 weeks.  I had Neulasta with each dose *8 total.  Should I be worried about side effects now.  I am 8 weeks out.  I know that neulasta is very expensive which may determine who receives it.  Kaiser does not include it in their protocols.  Patients administer their own Neupogen at home.  Since they are a dispensing facility they can do this which is why oncologists in private practice don't do this.  I don't know why they couldn't just order it from a pharmacy.  However, they would not make any money off of it that way.  I am learning about the economics of oncology.

							Well, my ANC was 0.2 MOnday and 0.67 today so once again I had no Taxol today. This is week three after Taxol #1, some dose dense! I have to go back Friday for yet another count. I feel that I have not received the dose-dense therapy that Memorial studied and God only knows if and how I will respond to this mess. I am not sure about the long term effects of Neulasta/Neupogen but having an ANC of 200 is pretty darn dangerous and if I had a fever I would now be in the hospital and in reverse isolation. I would like to know if this also happens despite Neulasta, then I would not feel as bad and disappointed. I still believe that they made a mistake. Not that I will take legal action or anything stupid, not my style at all, but I still feel terrible about all this mess.

							It is hard to choose between valuing your own perceptions and those who are licensed and paid to do their job, especially with something that gets as complex as cancer treatment. I don't think you would be as worried as you are if there wasn't good reason.

In your situation another opinion could at least perhaps relieve your mind, and if the advice is different from the treatment you are getting you at least would have more information to use in deciding what to do.

							This is to follow up on Sharon's post, the part of it that seems to assume that private practice oncologists insist upon giving shots instead of dispensing the neupogen to patients for the purpose of making more money.  In my case, I KNOW that that is not true. 

The reason in my case was my insurance.  I have a $500 maximum for prescriptions per year.  Anyway, my onc usually prescribes the neupogen and the patients self-inject at home.  However, if they did it that way for me (either dispensed it to me, or if they gave me a prescription for the neupogen), the insurance company interprets that as a prescription, and it would count towards my prescription maximum.  Which means that I would have to pay for it out of pocket, since I quickly ran out of prescription benefits (anti-nausea Emend cost me $282/chemo, so I maxed out almost immediately).  Neupogen is very expensive.  

So the only way that insurance would cover my neupogen is if I had it injected by a medical person - then it didn't count as a prescription, it counted as a covered procedure instead.   My onc arranged for me to get my shots at a hospital out-patient facility very close to my house rather than go to his office which is farther and where I'd have to pay for parking.   The onc was happy to make my life a bit easier by setting that up, and they didn't make any money on it.

It was because of the insurance company, not the oncologist, and he didn't make any money off of it.

No surprise, I despise my insurance company.  I am self employed, so my choices in plans were quite limited.

							Hi Rachel.  What a wonderful, accomodating oncologist you have.  It all makes sense.  It is difficult to have to play the insurance game.  Everyone has to know all the ways to best help the patient.  I am blessed to have excellent insurance.  I think my first three months of chemo ran about $18,000.  The Neulasta worked fine for me.  I am just left with peripheral neuropathy from the Taxol.  Neurotin does help and I just pray that it will gradually resolve even though it may take a year.  It was my oncologist's wife who told me about the reimbursement issue and the need to prescribe Neulasta for outpatient administration.  Sharon

							about your partner Kenneth's early death. We have a very close female friend who has just lost her husband to a heart attack when on holiday in Tenerife - he had no previous heart problems. It has been a devastating time for her. We, and another couple of close friends, are including her as much as we can in our social lives (we are all retired) - having her to dinner once a week, taking her out for lunch then a movie as we did yesterday. Just lean on your friends, and family if they are close by, and try to stay active. Sue goes to golf once or twice a week to meet up with other female golfers (most of whom are widows) and belongs to a local bridge club that she goes to once a week. These activities allow her to get out of the house and have some social contact. Perhaps you could go to some kind of evening classes and learn a new hobby? Trying a new sport, or going to the gym might help you too.

							My husband - age 53- had a routine PSA test 6 weeks ago - the first ever, as far as we know.  It was 28.  He went to a urologist  - recal exam indicated no abnormalities of the prostate -so he was given a six week course of bactrum.  Last Monday his new PSA test reading came back at 30.  A 12 sample needle biopsy was done yesterday and now we wait for the results.  

I've been reading a lot about PC and what I've noticed that nearly everyone who's posted to the forums I've been reading have had PC AND their PSA was much lower than my husbands.  I can only conclude that a PSA of 28 - especially with the rapid rise in 6 weeks to 30,  is not a good sign such as maybe advanced stage. My husband also has RA and has had many bone scans and x-rays over the past several years, nothing has been suspicious on those. However, being already used to bone pain might make it harder to know if cancer has spread to the bones.  Can anyone share with me their exepirnce or thoughts on this.

							Hello

A PSA of 28 or 30 is certainly concerning for prostate cancer. But there are cases when there are false positives. Regardless, you will have the answer soon with the biopsy results. As far as metastases, I think first the diagnosis of cancer has to be established to then look for signs of distant disease.

							First time I have posted on this forum so hope it works.  Yes you are very concerned at this time.  Two years ago my husband had a psa of 60 and it was cancer.  We did much research to find a cancer center who had the latest radiation treatment.  He had 42 treatments and two years later psa is .07.  Just check out the best treatment for his cancer.   Surgery is not always the best way to go radiation seems to be just as effective in many cases.  With the high psa my husband had they did not even suggest surgery.   I had bc cancer three years ago, we have found that doing your own research is not a bad idea. DR do not always tell you all of the side effects so look into it yourselves.  Good luck and maybe you will have good news and something else has caused the high psa it is not always cancer by any means.  Linda

							My husbands cancer had not spread to bones or organs but  was a little out of the prostate so had 26 pelvic radiation and 16 to the prostate only.  We did much research and discovered diet plays a major part in prostate cancer.  Unfortunately diet,  vitamins and herbs never make the medical profession rich so not much study done on this approach. There is some at MD Anderson and John Hopkins.  We are vegetarians, plus do herbs, vitamins and never eat any sugar which by the way is hard to do. Check labels in the store and you will find you might as well just go to the fresh fruits and vegs and forget the rest including all breads!  He did take Lupron during radiation and for one month after.  Drs wanted him on it until it didn't work anymore. He wanted his life somewhat normal so quit it plus there is much disagreement on if it ever extends anyones life taken sooner rather then later.  He knows there may be a time he will have to take it again.  He plans to do herbs first if that is necessary.  Our GP says his prostate is gone when he checked him.  He does not go to a cancer center anymore just the GP for psa checks.  Will what we are doing work I have no idea but two years ago they told him they would give him maybe ten years and only if he took the lupron we chose our own route along with a excellent ND doctor.   Just do your research before you sign your name for anything.  My husband is 64 so somewhat older then yours.  Linda

							I would go on hormone therapy immediately, and stop it when the PSA goes up.  

He will live longer if he cycles the hormone therapy and hit the cancer while the PSA is still low.  Don't wait for it to go out of control.

I have also heard that Prostasol does actually work, in spite of the shady past of the company.  I know a few men that have been on it for many years, with less side effects than Lupron.  They use it when nothing else works, and they appear to be successful.

							Hi,
I'm sorry to hear about your wife's dx of Stage IV breast cancer.  It's not good to have the cancer spread to vital organs, but many many women live years with mets to organs.  I've seen some ladies that chemo stablizies the tumor so they don't grow and others actually show NED (No Evidence of Disease) after they go through chemo and radiation.  Remember too that there are always new drugs coming out.  I was dx 3 years ago and in just those 3 years, there have been 3 new drugs to help stop the growth and/or prevent reoccurences.  They have gone from every 3 weeks to every 2 weeks with some kinds of chemo because they have found out BC responds better to that way of treatment.

Was this her original dx or did hers come back?  Is she estrogen and/or progesterine positive?  Depending on her age and if she's post menopausal there are several drugs they can give that kill hormones like Arimidex, which is what I take to hopefully prevent a reoccurence and there is also Femara and one more that I can't think of it's name.

Where there is life there is hope and this disease is so unpredictable.  There are stats out there, but we're not numbers, we're individuals.  Your wife is in for a hard fight, so tell her to put her battle gear on and kick some cancer butt 

Prayers to you and your wife and feel free to write anytime.  Keep us posted

							so very sorry to hear of your wife's mets....but hang in there as I have a tale to tell! I live in England, met some US friends in Spain when we all retired there some 20 years ago. Our friend Allan was diagnosed with stage IV non small cell cancer in his right lung some 4 years ago. They were told it was terminal and to make appropriate arrangements (sic).
He had his right lung resected and was very ill for a year afterwards - his wife even got a hospital bed delivered to the house. Trish finally got Allan referred to the Moffitt Cancer Hospital in Tampa, near to them in Florida and Allan saw 45 different doctors, cost over $1m  for his treatment, which was all covered by insurance. He then had to have his left kidney removed and that is when I flew over to help out. He looked like 90 yrs old - no hair, couldn't walk,eat or even brush his teeth.  We got him into a rehab unit for a month and he slowly started to pick up - but when we took him in there the administrator's first question was: ""Which funeral director have you made arrangements with?"" I was astounded by the lack of tact, but I guess down in Florida they deal with this all the time. 
Fast forward to last year - he made the long airline flight to England and stayed here a month, with us and various other friends and looks like 60 yrs old - he is 76 yrs old. He has a little problem with walking uphill due to decreased lung function, but is so enjoying his life and is participating in such. So, please, never give up hope - get whatever second or third, opinions as you can and go to the very best hospital you can find. Allan is now giving supportive talks to stage IV cancer patients at Moffitt - so there is always hope. If he can cut it, most of us can.

I got breast cancer 2 years ago which had spread by the time it was discovered, but Allan has been my absolute inspiration. My motto is, every day is a bonus, and I will do whatever it takes to give me more wonderful days. 

Truly hope for the best for you and your wife.

							I am so sorry to hear about your wife's diagnosis.  I know it is a difficult time for you both.  

While each patient is different, I can share with you that one woman I know who has been an inspiration to me, was diagnosed Stage IV and she is still alive and kicking 12 years later.  There's always hope where there is life.  I know there are many many more women out there who can tell you similar stories about survival.

My prayers go out to both of you.

							My grandmother was just diagnosed with multiple meyloma this month.  It came as a big surprise.

In December she had a problem with a fractured vertabre and went to the orthopedist.  She then had 3 more fractures after this and now has several fractures in her ribs.  She is in tremendous pain.

She is now just lying in bed, can hardly eat or walk.  She is losing about 3 pounds a week.

It seems as though she has lost her will to live as her daughter just died from stage 4 lung cancer and she lost her husband in June 2004.

Are there any treatment options for her?  Is  there a chance for recovery?

 My mom seems to think that she will recover.  I think it is denial as she is now facing the fact that she has lost her father and sister in a matter of 8 months and now possibly her mother.

							Hello

Lymph node cancer, also called lymphoma is a very serious disease, some can be cured and some have little chance of being cured. 

With that being, your chance of having lymphoma is very small, as opposed to this just being a lymphnode that is there. You should proceed with your consultation with your ENT, since this professional will be able to look at this area.

							Hello,
Well as for advice I would quit smoking. You may not have cancer, it could just be a lump of fat or some form of internal cyst, but why not let this scare have a positive effect, and quit smoking?

As for the rest, it looks like you did some research on WebMd or one of the other medical sites. Symptoms are very hard to use as a guide as to whether or not you have cancer. In my case I had no real symptoms, aside from symptoms that suggested I had a six month old son in the house ( being tired all the time, lack of sleep). So the best advice is to get the doctor and get checked out.

Good Luck,

							I just had a Bilateral Thursday the 14th. My left was invasive ductal carcinoma and my right was optional, however came up precancer in biopsy. Thank God for instincts. My nodes were not effected despite the large size of the 2 inch toumour. I have tissue expanders in both breast sites. It conserns me that there is so little information on the recovery and what to expect. I feel like a boa constictor is wrapped around me and I wish I had some ionfo for the range of normal recovery pain and discomfort. Any experience or gooks books on the matter ? Is there a spell check on this site ? My spelling is so poor.

							Hi,
The tightness you're feeling is unfortuately normal.  I tried bilateral reconstruction with expanders and then implants, but got no further then the expanders.  Are they planning on giving you radiation?  My plastic surgeon and another opinion I got from a different one both said they will no longer use expanders for ladies who have gotten or will get radiation.  There is so much damage to the tissue, that the skin just keeps getting tigher.  If you had the expanders put in after surgery, but prior to chemo, just my opinion, but it concerns me that you're having so much tightness already.  I had to have my expanders removed because the radiated side wouldn't stretch and the expander was literally trying to push back out of my chest near the sternum area.  Are you completely filled now?  From what I was told, the 1st couple days you would be tight and then it would get better, which mine never did, it was tight and painful all the time.  Finally after 4 months of filling and removing some saline, filling and removing, the PS went in to remove the damaged tissue from radiation and the tissue wasn't stretching and that's when he saw that it was trying to come 'back out.  I doubt I'll ever try reconstruction again, but if I do it will be the LD Flap.
I don't know if I was of any help, but feel free to write me if there's anything I can do.

							Thank You. My surgery was only about 10 days ago. I don't need radiation as the cancer was only in the breast. I'm no where near fully filled and see my PS next Monday. The tightness bothers me. When I sleep it gets worce and when I do my exercises it really gets worce. I just wonder if it's normal or not. I'm very muscular by nature and I guess I worry that my musles are non compliant with the efforts of the expanders. I expected a little relief by now. It's really hard to say since I can't find any info on what to expect after surgery. Cilver  


"

							I got tons of literature when I opted for the expanders as well as the PS's head nurse telling me what to expect.  I'd definately be asking for info that you can read.  I know women who have had expanders and were very happy and had no problems, but I remember the PS telling me that sometimes the tightness continues to get worse after the implants are put in and the tissue heals and tightens and some opt to have them removed because of the discomfort and sometimes they will look as round as a softball and not a natural look.  I'm sure mine was just telling me everything, even if it wasn't common so I could make an informed decision.  Hopefully all will go well with yours and you'll be pleased with the results.

							I got the literature from my Plastic Surgeon's office along with pictures of what implants looked like vs real breasts.  I know when I see someone on t.v. that is larger up top then most I can tell right away if they've had implants because of the before and after pictures I saw.  Not they I sit and look at women's chest..... lol  Next time you watch t.v. and you see someone with a low cut dress on they will either look like you did prior to your mastectomy or they will look rounded, the rounded ones are inplants.  The PS did tell me upfront that they wouldn't look like natural breasts, that they would be round and that's why he recommended the LD Flap since I was to chicken to even consider the Tram Flap, because they use your own tissue, muscle etc and they look natural.  Mine gave me literature, pictures, descriptions of the procedures of all 3 reconstruction choices.  After 4 months of pain and have to remove some of the saline to give me a break from the pain, then trying again, and the expanders had to be removed, I decided I'd be boobless and I'm very happy with my decision.  I'm not be any means telling you that you should do as I did, you have to feel good about your decision and you'll do what's best for you

							Dear Cilver,

Just a few weeks out, recovering from both a mastectomy and reconstruction, and probably node biopsy.  Well, yes, tightness is to be expected.  The expanders probably feel like bricks, and the skin/tisssue inside feels a bit abraded, right?  Normal, normal, normal.  

You should feel better soon.  When they do, that's when they will start the fill-ups!  Ah, no rest for the weary.  I got muscle relaxer meds for the first few weeks.   For pain I took Ibuprofin, which worked just fine.  I actually felt great after 2 weeks, and just some discomfort from the ""brick"".   By the way, it will stay like a brick.  But I love my silicone implant - it's soft, smushy and comfy.  So hang in there.

I also had about a 2 inch tumor (plus 2 others!) and had a single mastectomy, expander reconstruction, then chemo and radiation.  Since you are not getting radiaiton, you should have the most gorgeous set of breasts!  And not only now, but for years to come!  And it is easier with a bilat to get a matching set - my fake and real one are now at different altitudes (hey, the real one is 51 year old, it's entitled to droop a bit!) so I have to have surgery on the real breast for symmetry.  

The radiation complicates things a bit, but I am getting a pretty good result anyway since radiation came when I was all stretched out.  [See www.fotki.com/bcsurvivor for photos - read the Welcome for indepth info on what the story is.] 

For more discussion on expanders and implants, see www.komen.org and click on Forums, then Sound Off.  Search around, even in the archives, this is a topic that is discussed endlessly, obsessively, and in great detail.

By the way, make sure your surgeon doesn't overfill your expanders.  If he just fills to the point of tightness, it'll be fine.  I had no pain from fillups, but took ibuprofin ahead of time just in case.

							I'm new here. My dad was diagnosed with Stage IV lung cancer about 1 1/2 years ago. Things were going pretty well until recently. The tumor in his lung has been shrinking while on chemo (two different rounds) but several mets were discovered in his brain. He just finished whole brain radiation. 

The doctors increased the steroid (Dexamethasone) to 4mg 4 times a day because he was having a gagging sensation when trying to eat. He's still not eating. He will ask for something specific to eat but when the plate is in front of him, he will just sit there and look at it. Almost like he doesn't know how to eat. He will also complain about everything. (it's too salty, it's too dry, I can't eat bread...) 

The last CT (after finishing the WBR) showed no swelling in the brain so they are weaning him off the Dexa. He'll take 3 pill each day for the next 3 days, then go to 2 pills for 3 days and then 1 pill for 3 days and then be done. It also showed that all but one of the mets were ""dieing"". The plan was to do another CT in 2 months and if it's still there to do pin-point radiation. I'm not sure that he'll make it 2 more months. 

His behavior is very strange lately. He shows no emotion at all. It's almost like he's on Morephine or something similar. You can talk about him right in front of him and he has no idea what you're saying. He gets something stuck in his head (like he wants to go to the store) and when you tell him it's late and the store closed, he will argue with you. 

He also making up stories. He told my sister that I did something earlier in the day that I didn't. Then, he'll tell me that my sister did something that she did not. 

My mom is not handling this well at all. She can't stand to see him act so out of character. 

He's lost about 6lbs in the last few weeks but he's a thin man and really can't afford to loose any more weight. He'll drink Ensure but that's about it. 

Could this behavior be a side effect of the drug or from the whole brain radiation? From what I've read, Dexamethasone is supposed to increase your appetite but we're seeing the opposite. 

We've got a call into the doctor but I thought that I'd check here also. 

Thanks!

							Hello

I am sorry that this is all happening. There are a lot of factors that could explain this altered behaviours: certainly the metastasis, but also the dexamethasone could cause some changes in behaviour. The radiation could cause this, but I think it would be less likely.

I hope you find good support to handle this. I am sure Pat over at our ""Coping and Support"" forum could give you some pointers.

							My Mother just recently went through the whole brain radiation about a month ago. It was very extensive and lasted for two weeks. She too had lung cancer and had her upper right lung removed and went through chemo.
Everything seemed fine, she grew her hair back, was getting back to normal and then about a month and a half ago, she started having headaches. They did an MRI and found 3 tumours in her brain. The largest was about the size of a marble.
The radiation was horrible. Worse then chemo. The steroids are very tough medications and very harsh on the body but much needed.
My Mother too went through a personality change. She is also diebetic. 
She became forgetful, almost like a child. 
After all was done and they weaned her off the dexamethasone she seemed to be getting back to her old self. She had another MRI done and the other two tumours have shrunk but the big one shrunk 70 % which is good, I guess. They said it could stay the same of shrink more because radation continues to work after you are over it.
WE are worried right now because she has lost alot of weight and stays nausous and will not eat or drink much. Im making her an appointment tomorrow.
Please remember to not take your Dad litterally as to the things he say or does. it is just the radiation and the meds. You got to remember that he is having something done to a very important organ in our bodiesl

Please keep us updated.

My prayers are with you.

							Age 63, female. Smoker. Slight pneumonia for 1st time in Jan.  Two CXR's and one cat scan later I was told by a pulmonologist my GP sent me to for testing of PF, that after he reviewed the scan, etc. I might have lung cancer. I almost feel off the chair as this was not told to me by my GP.   He was sending me for PF testing.) MY GP, a few weeks ago, with the radiologist report in hand, admitted he had missed that paragraph!)
Anyway, I had an immediate can scan (which was two months after the first one) and it showed no growth and they said it had a cracked glass look, and that may or may not be cancer.  Wait and See .... three more months!  (This is in my left upper lobe, 2cm)  Also some 'spots"" in both lungs - which the 1st cat scan in January did not mention!  It was explained to me that it has to do with size of nodule and the slicing of the at scan.  And that a pet scan wouldnt pick them up either, they are too small.  Since that visit with the specialist, Im wondering, but why not do the Pet scan for the larger nodule?  What is it with this WAIT AND SEE treatment!.  
IS that all there is?  Wait and see ...come bacck for another cat scan in three months?  From what little Ive read on the net so far, even if it does grow that doesnt mean its cancer.  What is a person supposed to do in this case.  Not eat, not sleep, become anxious and loose weight ... another sign of cancer!
It seems to me that in this day and age there really should be better testing techniques for lung cancer and it doesn't seem, from what Ive been reading, that there is any.  Very little research has been done in ten or more years with any fervor.  Im getting the feeling that lung cancer is what no one wants to talk about, much less research, because most of us have done it to ourselves.  I really feel for those of you who have never smoked...that is ertainly not true for you but you are suffering because of smokers I guess.  I also wonder what in the world NIH, university labs  and other groups have been doing with the money they've received from the tobacco companies for lung cancer research.  I mean to say, without being facetious, WHY ISNT THERE SOMETHING LIKE A PAP SMEAR FOR LUNG CANCERS?  I dont mean that simplistic, but Lord knows there is just nothing out there.
HAve any of you had to live with WAIT AND SEE TREATMENT, from what i gather for at least a year or more, until they decide its PROBABLY NOT CANCER?  GOD love each and every one of you for being subjected to that ....  its almost as bad, I think, about finding out immediately.

							You have my sympathy korusgirl, even being brought on to the edges of a terminal illness is both frieghtening and depressing. There must be reasons for your health professionals not going on with other tests, biopsies etc. However your language would indicate your in the UK, e.g. using the term GP (general practitioner), and I know that some GP's have real problems with communication, as do many other proffessionals when dealing with extremely sensitive issues. Leaving you in limbo is a contradiction in terms when applying good health practice, this being the case you might consider seeing your GP for a frank discussion in which he/she explains to you why you've been left in this situation, there might be very good reasons why they cannot be clearer, on the other hand its unlikely there's a good reason for leaving you in a confused state.

							Hello There,

You must have a faith in your doctors (you deserve that!).  Get a second opinion from a board-certified oncologist (cancer doctor).  It concerns me that your GP would have ""forgotten"" an important pargraph in an important radiology report.  

Your very right, waiting can induce  stress related problems.  Get support and a second opinion.  If you are at a loss of who to see here are a few directions of were to start. Call an oncology department of a medical center attached to a college. I find that they have a tendency to know who is who. Maybe your GP (if you have enough trust for that) or a local Wellness Community.  Most cities have a place where groups are run and information is there about cancer help for the local area.

							Hello

I understand you are under a lot of stress and frustrations. Believe me that there is a lot of research going into lung cancer as well. It turns out that lung cancer is difficult to diagnose, because to get tissue samples you need to do an invasive procedure. PET scans are being more commonly used, and it can show high uptake with a cancerous nodule and therefore steer your doctor to proceed with a biposy earlier. If you are not satisfied with your current physician you should seek a second opinion. 

I hope it works well for you.

							I held off writing in my first email that I did have second pulmonologist opinion about a week ago.

I brought the two cat scans with me that I had, one from January's pneumonia and one from the first pulmonologist I saw at the end of March.  I live in NY State and went to Albany Medical Center for the 2nd opinion.
That doctor suggested waiting three months like the first pulmonologist  after reviewing the two cat scans.

I really appreciate your recommending that  I could go to an oncologist.  I was not sure I could do that yet when I didnt know yet if I had cancer. 

With lung cancer, does an oncologist operate or does he just treat you and a thoracic surgeon performs the operation if one is needed?  Like who does the bronchoscopies, etc. and I read on the net somewhere there issomething less invasive called VAT surgery.  Have any of you had this, or do you have any information about it?

Because my GP missed the important para.graph in the 1st cat scan report  about possible cancer in January and I didnt find out until almost the beginning of April, before I went to see the 1st pulmonologist, I felt I needed to ather the reports together and read them myself.

Well, I did not suggest you to go to an oncologist. I think for lung nodules and such the best people to investigate it are pulmonologists. Who knows what these are. Maybe a spot of infection, an old scarrred area, or cancer. So before you have the diagnosis of cancer you should not go to an oncologist, he/she will not be able to help you. Oncologists basically recommend treatments for cancer, involving chemotherapy, radiation, surgery. They are not surgeons. They are the primary provider to help cancer patients, and will refer you to other professionals as needed (radiation therapists, surgeons etc).

Do you still see your onco from time to time or are you still in the area that he's in?  I know where I live they have a lymphadema clinic for the ladies that have it and I would think the onco would know where  you'd need to go and who to see for it.  If you're in a different city or state, maybe call a cancer institute there and explain your situation and ask where they send their patients.  I've only had mild bouts of it and just kept my arm elevated for a couple of days and it would go away.  I know many that have to wear the sleeves all day and then a different kind at night.

							There is a special massage that you can get that really helps - my cousin swears by it (they took out 40 nodes - the doctor said Oops, sorry!).  It is lymphedema massage, it is feather light, and the light strokes go from the extremities to the shoulder direction, which helps the lymph exit.  This is NOT deep tissue or strong massage.  

Google ""lymphedema massage"" and you will find alot of info.

See http://www.cancerpage.com/centers/Si...lymphedema.asp , which says in part:  ""The National Lymphedema Network (www.

							Hello, Juliana,
I hope by now you've found the help you need, but in case you're still searching, there's a new site that has links to the National Lymphedema Network's referral list, plus the referral list of qualified graduates from four of the lymphedema training programs approved by the NLN (they meet the training standards of the Lymphology Association of North American--LANA).

www.mylymphedema.com

My own experience with arm, hand and chest LE is that not all therapists are skilled in chest LE, as it is rarer than other forms.  Be sure to ask what your therapist's experience and training have been for dealing with this.

Hope this goes well for you--LE is discouraging, but it does get easier to deal with as the care becomes part of your routine.  Hang in there and you'll soon be back to all your favorite activities.  (If you have trouble finding compression garments for the chest LE, let me know, as I've been through a real hunt for help with this and have uncovered a few resources).

I have seen bras for it which she says may do more harm then good.   It is very uncomfortable plus always a reminder of where I have been.  The breast is much larger most of the time so clothes don't fit right nor look very good.  No one seems to have any answers for it, I cannot afford to go very far for help.  Anyone who has any help for this please write.  I see there are a couple of you with information on this condition.  Linda

							Whoa, Linda!  Two years is a long time to wait for help with this.  Many of us have run into the problem of medical providers not knowing what's available.  I assume from the TN on your name you're from TN.  Do check the website I mentioned above (try all the links) for therapists near you.  Here's what you need: a referral for therapy from your doctor.  If the oncs aren't up on this, ask your surgeon or your PCP. For many years the only thing a woman could do was ""live with it,"" and many doctors are still in that mode.  But there is help.  Lymphedema masssage can reduce the swelling and open new routes for the lymph fluid to take to continue to drain the area.  Compression does help, but it's best to be fitted by your therapist or a fitter she recommends AFTER the swelling is reduced.  Bellisse makes a bra for lymphedema, and Juzo does also, though theirs is not in their U.S. catalogs and has to be requested specifically through a distributor.  Both should be covered as mastectomy bras under your insurance.  There is a 1998 Federal Act that mandates insurance companies to provide post-cancer lymphedema treatment if they provide cancer treatment (you may, of course, still have to pay the co-pay).

In the meantime, here are some things you can try for relief.  Don't wear an underwire bra or a bra with tight, narrow straps that cut into your shoulders, as both of these will block lymph vessels and make the condition worse.  Avoid heat--hot baths or showers (warm is okay), saunas, exercise in the heat, anything that raises your body's core temperature.  A camisole or sports bra may give better gentle compression than a regular bra, but again be careful of any tight binding.  Also, those sport shirts that bikers wear (CoolMax-type fabric) or a tight leotard can give relief and prevent further swelling until you can get help.

Getting help with this is essential because areas swollen by lymphedema are breeding grounds for bacteria, and once an infection is started (from something as simple as an insect bite!) it can quickly become systemic and often requires hospitalization for IV antibiotics.  In my opinion, it's also essential because it's either uncomfortable or (in my case) downright painful, so it's disabling because it immobilizes us.  The point is, there's no reason to ""live with it,"" because there's help.

Better end before your eyes wear out!  Please do check out the therapist lists and insist on getting qualified help,

							I just recently turned 40, and am premenopausal.  The drs. are thinking about suppressing (shutting down) my ovaries so they stop producing estrogen while taking Tamoxifen.  My tumor was 2.2 cm and ER+ meaning feeds off estrogen.  They can do this by removing ovaries through surgery, or radiation of ovaries , or meds. such as triptorelin given by injection once a month.
Has anyone out there come across this type of procedure??  If so what are your thoughts?? Maybe one of the drs. here could give some thought or advice.

							Hi Jill,
I was 43 when I was dx and the chemo put me into menopause.  I asked my onco about having my ovaries removed since I was Stage III and er/pr+.  They did some kind of survey or questionaire thing and he said it wouldn't benefit me.  I know your history will be different then mine of course because we are two different people.  I personally have only heard of ladies getting medicine to put them into menopause if the onco is wanting to put them on Arimidex and you have to be post menopausal for that drug.  That's all I know on the topic and I'm sure I wasn't any help.  Hopefully someone else can explain it more or know what questions to ask.

							Hello

I think in the end it is personal choice of what method to use to remove the estrogen production. If your doctor indicates that you'd be better off without the estrogen production, it is a matter of sitting down and talking to him/her about each of the methods involved. I think the less preferrable would be radiation, since it can cause a lot of problems, but surgery and medications also come with its down-sides.

							Hi Jill, Leo and Nancy,

OK...this subject really confuses me.  I went into menopause for 15 months then got my period back then gone again.  Now I got it again very light which only lasted 3 days.
I had a blood test that showed I was premenapausal so I realize it is a wait and see thing.
Here is my questions.  Those of us that are in their early 40's and got their periods back...... is this considered safe or not?????
I have been on tamox for 19 months and would not object to get my ovaries out if it added protection because of the hormone status. (plus the ovarian cancer scares the heck out of me)
My current plan with my onco is finish up the 5 years with tamox then hopefully switching over to arimidex.  I realize that you need to be in full menapause for Arimdrix but I have friends that started on the Arimidrix and still got there period back and had to be taken off.
Please help me understand if it is more harmful for us to get this spotting or our periods or not.  And...if we are considered premenopausal
how long does this typically last before the actual menapause sets in????  I just want to do all I can to prevent reoccurance.  Because of the Tamox we also have added risk of uterine cancer, so besides a pap every 6 months is it advised to get a uterine biopsy as well?  When I first began spotting right before my period came back I had a uterine biopsy and an ultrasound.  The biopsy came back fine (thank god) but my ultrasound showed ovarian cysts, which were followed and seemed to have disappeared.  
PLease help me understand all this!!!!!
THanks so much for you help

							Hi Kristen,
We were the exact same age when dx and it sucks.  I honestly don't know the answer.  Have you talked to your onco about having your ovaries removed or get that shot that puts you into MENTALpause?  I don't know if the combo of 3 chemos I took made a difference as far as it putting me into menopause or not.  My onco fully expected me to start having periods again within 6 months of finishing chemo, but I didn't.  I ""think"" (you know that's dangerous for me... lol) I asked about having my ovaries removed while I was on Tamoxefin and before I knew I was post menopausal, but I can't remember for sure.  I just wanted everything removed that produced hormones to give me my best shot since I was Stage III.  I'd talk to your onco and ask him the benefits of having your ovaries removed as far as helping to prevent a reoccurence.  I'm sure like everything else with this disease, there will be differences of opinion depending on which onco you talk to which is why we stay confused.  I really don't want to have surgery #9 (2 weren't BC/reconstruction related) but if it would help me live to be a ripe old age, then I'd do it in a second.  I know Arimidex is suppose to kill hormones vs. putting some kind of protector around them so cancer cells can't get to them (that still confuses me), but even with Arimidex, I'd have my ovaries removed if he thought it would be beneficial.
So, bottom line Kristen is I've been absolutely no help to you and I'm sorry.  I would think having it done would help any er/pr+ and especially when we're ""young"" and that isn't in our favor, but mine told me it wouldn't help my chances, so I'm lost and confused as well.  I'd talk to your onco at your next appt. and see what he/she says.  Let me know what you find out and I'm going to ask mine again when I see him and see if he still feels the same way.  I know getting through the 1st 2 years is a good thing because it shows our cancer wasn't chemo resistant and wasn't real aggressive, so they may be more apt to say no now because if it's not broke, don't fix it.........  I'm as lost as you.  I have my rad onco check up tomorrow so I'm having a case of canceritis and if I've made less sense then normal, I'm sorry, just real nervous when it comes to check ups.

							Hi Jill,
I too am going through the same thing right now. I just started Lupron injections once a month to suppress the ovaries. I'm seriously considering having the ovaries removed, like you, I'm scared to death of other cancers occuring. I even inquired about having a full hyst, I'm only 39 so my oncologist doesn't want me to have one, even though I'm done having children. The hot flashes started about two weeks ago, mild so far. 

Good luck with your decision.

							Well, I guess we can just keep asking in hopes of finding the correct solution..( what ever that may be).  I will be starting chemo 5/11/05 every 2 weeks for 8x's then onto radiation for 33x's....so I do have time to think this over and ask more questions before Tamoxifen use.  Its good to know that I'm not the only confused person out there.  All these different protocols, decisions to be made..I just want, like all of you, to do the best possible option to avoid any reoccurence.  That is our biggest fear once get through the treatments.  Thanks for all your thoughts. If I get anymore good info on this subject I will let you know.
God Bless and be well...

							I too am 44 and got my period back one time 15 months after starting chemo. A blood test a few months ago indicated I was not in menopause. They are currently doing clinical trials to determine whether it would benefit premenopausal women more to switch them to Arimidex or Femara after chemically supressing or surgically removing ovaries. For more info on this, go to the breastcancer.org site, it is excellent and gives you updates on everything.  Since I have only had one period, my onc is taking a ""wait and see"" approach, that is, I may go into menopause and be able to switch to the newer meds. In any event, he believes that ovarian supression would be of minimal benefit to me, as long as I am on Tamoxifen. This was confirmed by a speciality breast oncologist at the University of PA. In other words, they will know more about whether to force us into menopause and put us on aromitase inhibitors when these studies come back!

							I was 50 when diagnosed and still premenopausal.  My IDC cancer was 98% ER+ and PR+...very sensitive to hormones.  My onc. felt hormonal therapy was more important than chemo as my cancer was very slow growing.  I was put on tamoxifen which actually stimulated my ovaries!  My estradiol (the bad estrogen) was very high and I developed ovarian cysts.  My doctor suggested ovarian removal or suppression.  I chose suppression with Lupron because I figured I was so close to natural menopause.  That did the trick and after 6 months he took me off it.  My estradiol soared again and I redeveloped the ovarian cysts.  This time I went on the Lupron for a whole year.   I tolerated both the Lupron and the Tamoxifen really well.  When I ended the Lupron it appeared I was on the cusp of menopause so they kept me on the Tamoxifen.  This time I developed  uterine spotting.  At this point I wished I had had the surgery to remove the dang ovaries.  After a lot of testing, they decided that I was truely in menopause this time so they switched me to Arimidex.  I've been on it for 6 months and feel like an old woman with arthritis.  

I think that the reason there is so much conflicting advice is because each of us have such different cancers.  My cancer was much more hormonally sensitive than many others.  Therefore ridding me of estrogen was more important than someone who is ER+, but only 30%.

							I keep forgetting to ask my onco about this, so leo......help.....LOL

I'm er/pr+  both in the mid to upper 70s%.  Does Arimidex. Tamoxifen work better with a high % or a low %?  Or is it one of those damned if you do and damned if you don't.  Arimidex would help someone with a higher % but chance of reoccurence better, then someone who had a low% and even though Arimidex wouldn't work as well because the cancer didn't need alot of hormones to feed off of, but less likely to come back because the cells would have to work harder to find receptors?

I totally confused myself just now, but hopefully you can figure it out and make sense of it............LOL

							In September of 2004 the diagnosis was cholangeocarcinoma.  The Whipple Procedure surgery was in October, radiation consumed December and January, and chemo took February and March.  Now, all of that is over, the CT scan is clear, and I don't have to go back for a while.

I am very grateful just to be alive.  The new challenge is to find out what the ""New Normal"" is.  It was easy enough to see something happen and say, ""well that must be because of the treatments,"" but with the treatments over, that excuse is rapidly losing its significance.  Now I get to find out what it means to have that much less digestive tract to use, with its new configuration.  

This must be a common situation, the post-cancer discovery of what had changed.  I know I ""got off easy"" with merely a long ugly scar somewhere that no one sees, and nothing missing which is necessary to live, or cosmetically an issue.  Nevertheless, this is something which was never discussed by any medical professional that I saw.  What will be normal once the surgery and treatments are done?

As I said, I am very glad to be alive.  Life has, however, changed permanently.
						

"

							The new normal will be in all likelihood a date in which you can say, I used to feel like this, now I feel like that. I used to eat this food, and now it does/does not agree with my digestion. I used to have this pain, now I have that pain and this pain occurs when the weather changes and that pain occurs only when I do this. 

We all tend to mark time as being before or after a major event in our lives. Cancer whether it was life threatening or merely inconvenient for a while, is a major life event. It is to those professionals who did not mention it. Some of those people have had and will later have their own Day of when the earth stood still for a few minutes while they contemplated their own mortality. It is a private moment and that is probably the reason they could not find it within themselves to discuss it because they knew that they could not tell you how to feel about it.

							Leo, 
    Why dont you help someone that really needs it man? I mean this is driving me nuts, I have pm'd you I have done what you told me to do and still i get no replies , I told you about the staph strep and yeast that I was told that I had in my feet by a dermatologist and everyone says that it isnt skin cancer though cause skin cancer doesnt manifest itself in this manner, well I am not HIV positive either, what is up with all of this , you doctors these days blwoing people off that are actually in need, it isnt like i said hm i have skin cancer and let it there to not be looked at or any thing, you say that it cannot just disappear, wll i agree with that , I just think that it has spread, i told you about my throat now, my head feeling hot etc. is it possible for someone to hav e cancer in thier feet, hands, throat, head, neck etc. and still be able to function ? I mean this is nuts no one will tell me or help me with anything, Leo what about arsenical cancers ? or cancers from mercury etc. I am serious this is so bogus you guys dont help anyone anymore, you all treat symptoms not the problems. Am I a write off or something ? I dont act this way when I am at work, I am a policeman of 10 yrs, if I didnt this to someone id get wrote up, but if a doctor gets wrote up it gets blown off, not that I am doctor shopping or anything like that or looking to sue someone, i just want some freakin help here. I have been on all of ths wonder pill anridepressants which make me worse and no one wants to beleive that one, but they do and yes I been on them more than a few weeks each, you know what is a shame , my mother was done this same way to the exact t and everyone gave her the bogus your nuts, your a hypochindriac etc. and she kept saying, I have breast cancer, well our family doctor killed her, he blew her off for years and then boom, she found it alright and was told that she had breast cancer and it was all taken out, well they were wrong, it went to her brain and boom she was gone. you guys are all the same.

							Leo, 
     I am not trying to flip on you or anything, Yes I know I have had numerous examinations, but if they saw the way i looked before they would see that somethng is wrong. I went and had a MRI and nothing was found only that I have either Atrophy or Hypoatrophy depending on the way you look at it,  if one side grows more than the other . 
     As far as the examinations, no one has done a biopsy, or blood work or anything. I mean what does it take to get a doctor these days to do any of that stuff ? I have told them I have lost weight, 40 pounds now in 8 months, my hands are red, my feet are cold but they sweat, my skinis losing pigmentation and I am still flipping out over possible HIV exposure even though I have been tested twice and stil nothing shows up I have had the blood and the swab test both done with a non reactive result. 
     Also in reference to cancer, I had two spots on my fingers that are now gone, one spot on my toenail and it is also gone and then all of this stuff began with the strep, staph and yeast infection. 
     You said none of this is typical of melanoma but does anybody have any documentation on what if melanoma gets out of control or overlooked?  I just need to know what is going on. Can melanoma spread like this ? OR do you thnk it could possibly be a heavy metal toxicidity? OR do you beleive in that ? I am not trying to be argumenative or agressive with anyone, if this was in person you would see that i am desperate not, crazy and not depressed or anxious I just want to find out what is wrong and what is going on . 
      Do you have any suggestions what so ever on how to check for malignant melanoma if the original site is not visible ?  There has to be something they can check into. 
      'And Leo, gee thanks for saying that maybe the problem isnt with the doctors , wouldnt it tick you off that no one has done a biopsy or anything ? Dont you think that is crazy ? I mean a guy is setting here begging, pleading for help and no one will do anything of the such of taking blood or a biopsy? Dont you think from a medical perspective that is just ludicrous? Especially if the patient has been steadily losing weight for 8 months ?  As for the HIv thing I havent even had contact with anyone in 3 yrs. and this comeson all of a sudden like this during a game of softball ?

							LEo, 
      Thats what I have been trying to d this whole time , my doctors dont even beleive me about the two spots I had on my fingers cause they are not there any longer and the one on my toenail. Theyare all gone, then someone tells me skin cancer does not manifest itself this way, how do we know that , has anyone ever seen melanoma that has been let go crazy and out of control ? DOes anyone know how the body eacts to it once it has gone out of control. I even pointed out th two spots on my fingers to my original doctor and he said looks like an allergy of some kind, didnt even check it for melanoma.  I dont know what else to do anymore, my insurance is now about expended due to all of this. IF this is even a arsenical cancer which yu and other people have told me that most skin cancers are, it wont even show up in a blood test will it ?
        I came here to ask questions Leo, not to be antoagonistic or appear anxious or anything of the sort, I am like many other people on here who look for hope, and I am sorry for seemingly going spastic on yu , but I just thought that you being a doctor could give some insight.

     I am a friend of Illini's , man is there anything you can assist him with, he is scared to death, he did have the stuff on his feet and hands as he has told you and other doctors and I fear he is getting ran around, not by you but by the other doctors and dermatologists he has seen. He told them about the two spots on his fingers and his big toe on his right foot. HE fears this has spread due to him having pains in his left side of his chest, left side of his throat and his feet sweat and are cold all of the time and he has lost 40 pounds since august of 2004, his skin looks dry all the time and his hands look like leather now. 
       We have looked up several pictures on the internet due to none of the doctors wanting to do anything but give him antidepressants that dont work on him and make him worse sending him to the emergency room. 
       He says that it feels like it had spread to his mouth due to white patches now in his mouth, his gums are receeding nowand he looks awful. 
      Is it possible the spots were superficial melanoma  ? Thats what it looks like to us, he went to a doctor to have the spots checked out a few yrs ago and they told him it was possibly an allergy. But if it was superficial melanoma what do you think could possibly be done and if it has gone all over his body what is the prognosis and would it be able to be detoxed out of his body if he did everything to detox the right way? Since skin cancers are arsenical cancers would a heavy metal detox help in anyway ? Or would any type of chemo help him do you think or would it make it worse ?

The free PSA is more reliable than the standard PSA.  To accurately determine what is going on, the biopsy is the best, and there is little chance of infection as long as they give you antibiotics first.  Prostascan is the best scan for pCa.  Yes there is a new ""PSA"" test that is about to come out.

							Hello

PSA levels are reliable to detect abnormalities. The problem is that high levels are not always indicative of disease, causing a lot of anxiety and procedures. But there is no other way to rule out cancer other than having a biopsy. The chances of infection are very low, but as with all procedures there are risks involved. Personally I would have the biopsy to establish the diagnosis.

more I read about prostate cancer more it seems lost time and money for testings and biopsies.  If PSA is above 2.0 basically one has to get checked every 6-12 months. Above 4.0 , even if biopsy is negative one is always in doubt every few months. Every time PSA comes to be high one wonders what is going on in prostate.  

I am going to have my PSA repeated in 2-3 months. If it comes higher than 4.0 , instead of biopsy it seems better to just remove the prostate. If I do that I have to check what such a removal will do to my life span even though it may affect the sex life.

Anil:
Do not have surgery done until you get a positive biopsy, no matter what.  The biopsy is no big deal.  Removal will not hurt life span, but it may affect sexual function and urinary continence.  If you do have a positive biopsy, get the nerve sparing from an active urologist, someone that does one or two a week, like myself.

							Helllo There,

Just a note to support Dr. Leo's comment on anxiety.  Confusion may also go hand and hand with frustration.  We can be blocked from reaching a certain goal and then frustration sets in. You want and need information NOW.  Add fear to that and our days and nights can get rough.  I agree with Dr. Leo get the biopsy; long periods of waiting can result in too much emotional pain for you and your loved ones.

I send you my best wishes for a good outcome.  If you have any specific diffficulties a theraist can help with write back.  Get all the support you can.  If you do need some further information after the biopsy I can recommend a few practical and easy to read books.  Let us hope you will not need them!

							I am very new to all this and very confused and millions of questions.  My Dad was recently diagnosed with lung cancer, in October the lower lobe of the left lung was removed and the report was great.  The cancer was gone!!! December my Dad went to the ER complaints of chest pain, the cancer was in the remainder of the lung and this was removed in early March.  The results on the lymph nodes a week later showed cancer present in one of the six lymph nodes that were tested.  He is not a candidate for chemo or radiation because of only having one lung and very weak from these surgeries.  This is all I knew at this point.  This past Saturday my Dad again went to the ER with complaints of chest pain thinking for sure he was having a heart attack.  He was told that he was not having a heart attack but with the x-rays it was the suggestion of the ER physician for Dad to call his Oncologist first thing Monday morning.  My Dad is more comfortable with his family doc so he sought the opinion from him first.  Upon speaking with the nurse the only information that she could give my Dad is that the cancer is now acute and that it is urgent that he is in the office Friday morning to discuss this with the Doctor.  What does this mean ACUTE?  I know that my Dad now is having a lot of trouble eating, he states that he can eat a mere 3-5 bites and is in a lot of pain and feels very full.  My dad seems to think this cancer is now in his stomach.  What should I expect at this time?  I live 5 hours away from him and limited on when I can be there.  I know I must be rambling so any insight anyone has would be greatly appreciated.

							Hi clarkbar,

I too am all knew to this. Unfortunately I can't help you with the information you are seeking but can lend a listening ear. I know there are so many emotions going through your mind. I still can't get it straight. I am 26 years old and have 2 brothers that are 24 and 20 and my mom was diagnosed with cancer in Nov. Breast cancer metasized to the bone. She has many bone lesions and there is no cure. It is considered chronic but she is doing well after overcoming many obstacles. IN the beginning there is so many emotions. Mine i find are anger adn betrayal. Why I don't know I just feel that my mom has been through so much only 48 years old she is a widow since 33 so it has been just the 4 of us for a long time. I always say I am too young to be an orphan. I don't know how she gets through her days as she is the one living the nightmare. I can't change the past or the what the future holds. My advice to you is be there for your dad no matter what. Even if it is getting him his favourite chocolate bar. It will help you cope with it. Do not let cancer run your life take control of the disease. Research everything you can you can probably get a better gasp and realistic view of things.

I myself was not told at the time of my dx that there were any trials of the herceptin for us early stage HER2+ women.
At the time of dx I didn't even know anything about the HER2..I feel my onco at the time missed the boat with me and it is still bothering me to this day (as you can tell).  I guess its time to put it to rest since there is nothing that I can do about it now, but I sure would have liked to have had the opportunity to be given the option of the trial.

							Hi Kristen,

I was referred to one of the most knowledgeable and well-loved oncologists, but I have to say that I think that for that very reason that kind of conversation just didn't happen for me, either. He can only help so many in a day. 

I still get upset about it too. At the time I was saying I wanted to be part of a clinical trial but I didn't know how. He just said there were thousands of them. When I tried to figure out questions to ask he just said it was all ""academic"". Finally I asked him if I could talk with one of his nurses instead. He didn't really want to do that, but he let me. I told the nurse that I wouldn't mind talking to any ""junior oncs"", but they weren't into that either. It seems like there should be some kind of intermediate person who might handle our questions but I'm not sure who that would be. 

I'm thankful for the honest and thoughtful answers this forum allows.

							Dear Kristen and AA,

Try to look at your healthcare team memders not only as doctors but, as something you are buying.  It may seem odd to hear that but, they do earn their living providing health. When you feel they missed the boat polietly let them know !  You are one of the ""heads"" of the team and it  is, of course, your life. Don't let it go until you are satisfied. 

As a therapist that was once a nurse I know this can be hard but it is empowering!  This comes at a time you can use all the power and control over decisions as you can get.

AlaskaAngel, you should go back to school and become a therapist! You are great with support and practical advice.

							Recently had a CT Abdomen with contrast.    There was two 4 mm spots on my liver, and the Radiologist said malignancy could not be ruled out.   My oncologist felt it was nothing to be concerned about, and in any case, there was no further procedures to be done at this point, as these spots were too small to biopsy (NOTE: liver enzymes are fine, and I feel very healthy.......don't know if this is impt info, but thought it might be).   

The oncologist felt it would be a real surprise if my cancer (see vital stats below) would mets to the liver so quickly, and said it was probably cysts, as they are quite common (????  is this really true????) 

Should I be concerned?   What is the next step for me?   Any of you have this type of results?

I have a ""spot"" that is likely a cyst in one kidney they are watching with 4 to 6-month ultrasounds and am due to have one next week. They also use the same ultrasound to watch 2 likely hemangiomas in the liver that have been there for years now and haven't changed. And I have had mildly elevated liver function tests even before diagnosis several years ago that sort of bump along.

Liver cysts are really common. If there is a question of what it might be, and these are really small therefore not ""biopsiable"", we usually follow with serial imaging studies, be it either CT or ultrasound.

							Hi Roxanne,

 I think the follow up test will give them something to compare it to. I also had a CT scan done2/11/05 I've got a copy of the findings in front of me ,but I'm not really sure what some of it means.It's as follows:

 FINDINGS-No evidence of mediastinal or hilar lymhadenopathy.Tiny subcentimeter lymp nodes in bilateral axilla are identified,which are nonspecific.The patient is status post left mastectomy.No evidence of pleural or pericardiac effusions. No evidence of pulmonary nodules.
 Fatty infiltration of the liver is identified. A 3.2 x 3.7 cm low attenuation lesion in the medial segment left hepatic lobe (image 6 is identified measuring 11 HU , most likely representing a cyst.No other focal liver lesions are identified.The spleen, adrenal glands, pancreas, and kidneys are within normal limits. The gallbladder is partially decompressed. No evidence of mesenteric or retroperitoneal lymphadenopathy. The bowel is normal in caliber.No evidence of free intaperitoneal fluid or air. The uterus is identified. No evidence of osseous metastatic disease.

I'm not sure what all of this means  ,but you are not alone.I go back next month for another CT scan,basically because of past history(w/cancer).I was also told that Liver Cyst are common.It's better to be safe than sorry. Waiting is probably the worst thing because we always imagine the worst-can't help it.

I hope everything turns out okay.Take good care of yourself and try not to worry.I'll keep You in my prayers, keep us posted.

Tell me your onco has scheduled a biopsy to see what's going on?
Keep us posted and will be praying for B9 whatever it is.  Could it be an infection?  I'm a firm believer after my dx and what I've learned, the only good lump/mass is one in a jar.  I'd sure be having that biopsied.

							Hi I am 30 years old. I had my uterus and cervix removed 4 years ago but still have ovaries. I found a small hard lump in 10/04 and went for mamm and US. The lump I felt is a sebaceous cyst. US found another solid hypoechoic nodule measuring 4mm. I cannot feel that one. They told me to come back in 6 months. I went on 4/14/05 to have another US and the nodule has grown slightly and now there is another one. Again very small but described as solid hypoechoic. I go today for FNA. Is FNA going to tell me for sure that this is b9? What does solid mean? What does hypoechoic mean?

							I'd recommend finding and buying or borrowing a copy of Dr. Susan Love's Breast Book and reading about FNA in there to figure out whether you prefer FNA, core biopsy, or excision biopsy and to get an understanding of what stereotactic biopsy is. 

""solid"" is a term used in radiology to indicate that whatever that lump is, it is not fluid-filled; fluid-filled would be interpreted as benign. However, not all solid lumps are cancerous, which is why a biopsy is necessary to say for sure.

I think that you are wise to think ahead, but perhaps you are going overboard with your concerns?  Most women are able to work almost all days - some are not, but you don't know yet how she will react, it is so very individual.

If she gets neupogen or neulasta shots to boost her white blood cell count, then she really shouldn't have to worry about germs so much.  I had Neupogen, and my doc told me not to be in a closed car for 5 hours with a person with a hacking cough/bad upper respiratory infection and he let me go if I wore a mask.  But I was not otherwise restricted, did not have to avoid crowds or anything like that.  So look into the neupogen/neulasta.  

About the chemicals, well, that sounds like more of a problem.  Have you asked the doc about her being in range of the chemicals and what effect it could have on her?

If she is very active on her job, that may be a bit of a problem - I did well on chemo, but was tired.

Oh, I really sympathize!  Not only am I self employed, I also have a disability plan that I need to be disabled 6 months for before it kicks in.  So I never used it.

I had a CT Scan of the chest, chest x-ray, labs and bone scan before my treatment started so they could get an accurate diagnosis.  I've heard of very few who didn't get these prior to treatment.  You should never feel like you are insulting the oncos intelligence.  Your mom has ever right to know about the care she is getting and to question anything that she's unsure of.  Chances are this and that, but without the tests/scans, they really don't know for certain where they stand and assuming isn't good enough for me.  This is too imporant to assume anything.

That's wild.

I always leave the med. onco's appts feeling relieved after the labs because they tell more then I realized.  You could always go to your PCP and have a CBC and CMP twice a year, I'm sure he/she would do that, would be like a physical if you wanted labs checked.

Fortunately, I see my new medical oncologist (out-of-town) on Tuesday of next week.  I saw my ""old"" one 9 months ago.  I'm going to see what the new one says about the bloodwork.  Specifically, what do I ask for?  Any specific blood test?  I haven't a clue.

Speaking of PCPs.....I got a call from mine last week and he has cut me off from my surgeon and radiation oncologist.  He said one year after treatment ends that there is no need to see them anymore.  He said, ""You only see a surgeon if you are having surgery and all breast tissue radiation changes are done and it doesn't have to be watched any more.""  This.....in spite of the fact that they both requested to see me again.  PCP is hinting around that he and he alone wants to handle all follow-up from now on.  I don't want that because he knows very little about BC and radiation effects on the breast.   BUT....I have lousy health insurance (HMO) and need his referral.  SO......I'm wondering how long before he cuts me off from the med onc????  I have a feeling that's next.

							Wow Margie,
I know what I want to say, but it would get bleeped.  I realize that I was dx Stage III, and I saw my med. onco every 3 months for labs and poking and prodding.  I saw my rads. onco for awhile pretty frequent for about the 1 st year.  I saw my surgeon quite a bit, but that's because of having so many surgeries for 2 separate mastectomies and then fixing the mess that happened after my reconstruction diseaster.  After the 2nd year, I went to once a year with the rads onco and once a year with the surgeon.  My med. onco was going to put me to every 6 months after 2 years NED, but I didn't want to give up that much of my security blanket, so I'm seeing him every 4 months and I have my appts. for June and Oct. with him.  MY guess is he'll put me to every 6 months if I'm still NED after 4 years, which would be after my Feb. visit.
I hate how much control insurance has over OUR lives.  I see my PCP for general stuff and he's taken over giving me my meds for my thyroid that got burned during radiation, but my med. onco still gives me my RX for Arimidex and anything BC related.  I can call my onco anytime if I have a problem and go see him.  My surgeon asked if I had a preference and I told him who I wanted to use based on referrals and just by reputation and I don't have to go through anyone to see any of the specialist since I'm established with them.  I can see a med. onco seeing his patients every 6 months if you're a Stage I, but everyone I know, including me, will be seen at least every 6 months for 5 years, then you go to once a year unless there is a problem.  A friend of mine was cut loose from her med. onco after 10 years, but can go see him anytime she has a problem, which she hasn't thank God and her PCP does the labs once a year.
I feel so bad that, in my opinion, you aren't getting the care you deserve.  I'm praying this new onco will have a different attitude and will give you the reassurance that you're doing well by doing labs and checking you out on a regular basis.

I'm leaving about 4 a.m. Sunday, so I'm hoping to get to bed at a decent hour tomorrow night (sleep is hard for me to get much of) and I'll be home late Sunday night, but please e-mail me and let me know how you are and if you need to vent, cuss, scream, talk, or anything, I'll check my e-mail as soon as I get home and on and off tomorrow and before I go to bed.  I'm here anytime, so please don't hesitate to e-mail me.  

I'm definately going to enjoy the race.  My boy qualified the fastest so the race Sunday is off to a good start for me.  I'm going to miss not being there tomorrow like I miss being there today, but just getting away and going to the big race is o.k.  Next court date with the idiot isn't until July, so maybe if that actually happens for a change, it will be financially easier and I can go to an Atlanta race as well as the fall race at Talladega.   Oooops, rambling big time here.

Take care and you're in my prayers that you get some answers.  If you would feel better have labs done, TELL the new med. onco you're going to .  You've got to be an advocate in your care because you know what you need and piece of mind goes a long way.

							Danielle,

Forgive me, but I don't like your Mom's oncologist.  You must feel comfortable asking questions, and you have to feel that he is really listening to you.  If not, he's going to miss something, or you will always be in fear that he missed something, and that will drive you both crazy.  Second, I had (and I think it is standard protocol) to get all sorts of tests before chemo, to both have a baseline, and also to see if your body can take the toxic effects of the chemo.  I think it is dangerous to NOT have the tests.

I had a MUGA, a CT and a bone scan.  The MUGA scan checks your heart, because chemo is tough on the heart, and some people can't take it.  I think the CT and the bone scan check for metasteses.  Since mine came out ok, I kind of forgot the purpose of each one.  But they rushed me in to get those tests before chemo, and wouldn't have started chemo without them.  By the way, they are time consuming, but no big deal.

I suggest you RUN and get an appt for a second opinion with another Oncologist.  I know time is running out, but I really think that you are not being treated properly.  Usually, oncs get you in pretty quickly, and can schedule your chemo to begin quickly also.  I would postpone chemo until you find the right onc for your mom (they may have a different treatment plan in mind), but move quick, you don't want to postpone for more than a few days or a week.

I had decided on one oncologist before my mastectomy, but when I met with him after it, and discussed my treatment in more detail, I felt that he was not looking out for my best interests, so I went to another for a consult.  The second was really straight up with me, and I felt that I could trust him.  So I ditched the old one.  And I am so glad that I did.  The treatment that the first one wanted to give me was not the best one for me.

Do not be afraid to consult another onc. or any other doctor.  It's your Mpm's life we are talking about here.  

Good luck.  Let us know what happens, please.

							I have just had my first baseline mammogram (6 mo following surgery)after chemo and radiation.  I was told the results said normal and follow up in 6 months.  However, when I went to the onc today and asked to read the report, it said mass found at surgical site, assume scar tissue, follow up in 6 months.  I then questioned the onc and insisted that I have an ultrasound to see exactly what that mass was and not ""assume"" it was scar tissue.  This is because when I was diagnosed in October it was because the tumor was hidden behind scar tissue from a previous biopsy 6 years ago.  So I don't trust mammograms as an end all to diagnosis.  I'm sure they are probably correct that it is scar tissue because that makes sense, however, has anyone else been told on their first mammogram after surgery that they have scar tissue at the surgery site?  

I can't imagine that I could possibly have a cancer cell left in my body after three chemo drugs and radiation treatment but I don't trust this disease to do what it ""should"" do.  I'm just glad I have an onc that is willing to give me peace of mind and order the extra tests that I think need to be done, however, that does require that I be my own advocate for medical treatment and stay up on things.

Any information or experience with similar mammogram results would be appreciated.

							Hi Marion,
I don't blame you at all for pushing the issue and I would do the exact same thing.  All I know is when I had my simple mastectomy on the non BC side and attempted reconstruction, they sent the incision area from the original MRM to pathology to check for a local reoccurence.  I don't know how common it is, but it's not rare from what I understand to have a local reoccurence at the incision line.  IF and I'm sure it's a small chance, but IF it is BC in the incision line, that doesn't make you a stage IV, it's a local and you continue on the NED path but obviously have to get rid of it.
I'm sure you'll be giving us good news and Im glad you're onco is like mine.  He doesn't do unnecessary testing, but even if he feels everything is fine, if he knows another test will give me piece of mind, he'll do it for me and that means a lot.

							I finished radiation in Dec of 2002. I have a lump in the area of lumpectomy much larger then the tumor was. It has been there since I finished radiation. I had a ultra sound four months after radiation was finished also a mammogram.  Every six months I have a mammogram.  They always say I have a seroma.  It is also painful, bras hurt, plus I have fluid in my breast that seems to move around.  Nipple area becomes very hard after a day of work.  If anyone has any idea what to do about any of this let me know.  Maybe you have a seroma in the area? If so it does generally go away so they say.  Check up and mammogram due next week every one worries me as I keep thinking this breast ought to settle down.  I have read that sometimes it never does.  Linda

							Marion ~ I also had the mammo after lumpectomy and rads were finished, to be used as a baseline.  I'll share with you what mine said:

  ""Only minimal postsurgical changes at the lumpectomy site of the right breast are noted, but no specific or significant changes on either side from preoperative exam of 7/02/2003 are evident that are disgnostic for interval malignancy.  Incidental note is made of some increased density in the right breast secondary to the radiation changes.  (Benign - 2) ""

I spoke with my rad onc at my follow-up in January and voiced my concern about the ridge/lumpy thingie in the area.  He said it felt like scar tissue and changes from radiation, that this is expected.  BUT...if you are concerned you should definitely press for more testing.  I couldn't get a referral for more testing but was told to just watch for changes for the next 6 months.  So far, it doesn't feel like there are any changes.  Yearly mammo is in 9 weeks, so we'll see.

Good luck, Marion.  I really hope this resolves to your satisfaction.

Hugs,

							Thanks, everyone for the information.  I have the ultrasound scheduled for next Friday.  Fortunately I don't have to wait too long to get it done.  Please keep me in your thoughts and prayers that all turns out uneventful.

							Just wanted to do a follow up and let everyone know the results of the ultrasound.  Truly this will be a blessed Mother's Day.  The ultrasound only found scar tissue at the surgical site and NED.  Even the small fluid filled cyst in a totally different part of the breast that was there last fall (not cancerous) is now gone. I'm told that's because chemo puts you into menapause and changes the chemical balance which can make these types of cysts reabsorb and go away.   

The peace of mind is priceless, wonderous and such a relief.  All chemo is now complete, radiation complete and now on to the next stage of Tamoxifen with routine mammograms every 6 months and blood work every 3 months for the next year.  

Ladies this is doable.  You can beat this.  At the beginning it seems like a long road and you have to take each day (each treatment) at a time.  But there is light at the end of the tunnel and it's not a train -- its life!

Happy Mother's Day to everyone!

							hi everyone.  here's my story about scar tissue.  i was dx 8/02 invasive ductal carcinoam and dcis, 9mm tumor, her2neu 3+, elston grade 3, hormone negative.  had lumpectomy, resection and 42 rads, NO chemo.  at the 6 month checkup there was a very large lump of junk at the incision site.  it showed in mammo, in sono....it was biopsied and came back as scar tissue.  at 12 month checkup same deal....i had 3 biopsies on that lump of junk in a two year period when i decided enuff is enuff and asked to have it removed.  it was removed 8/04.  one week later my breast swelled up to the size of a canteloupe and i went to the emergency room and was admitted for 3 days to the hospital.  i had a breast seroma and they withdrew 120 cc's of fluid from the breast.  two weeks ago, i found a lump in my arm pit.  went to doc, had a biopsy and weds nite was told i had recurrent cancer in the lymph node in my arm pit.  today i went to the hospital to have scans done.  i am thankful, it has not metastisized to any other organ or to the bone everything was clear.  EXCEPT the breast (same one) shows a small area that they now say they don't know if it is also a reoccurrence of the cancer OR more scar tissue.  i see the surgeon on tues and expect to be operated on within the week ... have chemo appointment with med onc 5/18th.  i feel that ANY lump of junk in a breast cancer patient should be removed just in the event there is the slightest chance that a biopsy misses the exact location that a cancer cell may be lingering.  i honestly feel that my lump of junk had such a cell although I am only going on my gut instincts.  otherwise, why would i suddenly get a reoccurrence in a lymph node under my arm?  by the way, they did a sentinol node biopsy and every node they took out 3 yrs ago was negative.  So I am telling you guys don't take those lumps of junk lightly.  And I don't mean to scare anyone but we need to be in control of our destiny and if your gut tells you something is not right or, if you do not want to walk around with it in there, have it removed, have it biopsied, don't delay and do not wait 6 months.

							Hi, Sunny, thanks for your story.  I can appreciate that when you've been through as much as you have been, caution is the word.  It is for me too which is why I was not satisfied with just the mammogram.  Unfortunately you'll never get rid of the scar tissue because everytime they go back in to remove the scar tissue or do more surgery, there will always be scar tissue that develops.  So a viscous circle develops where at some point we must educate ourselves as best we can, ask enough questions, determine if what we are being told makes sense, and then go on our way always watching.

I was told by my onc that they are seeing more tumors develop where biopsies were previously done.  He didn't know if that was because that area was just predestined (since the need for biopsy had already occurred) or if the ""disruption"" of tissue and resulting scar tissue was hiding it.

In any case, after 3 opinions by radiologist, oncologist and ultrasound technician I trust they are correct and only scar tissue exists.  Once you've put your trust in your team, all that's left is your trust in God who I believe always provides the correct answer.  

Take care.

							I have autoimmune diseases and many breathing problems.  A little while ago, they ran more tests and told me that both lungs had many, small nodules on them.  The doctor recommended that I go back for another test in a few months, but he seems to think that the nodules can be attributed to Mixed Connective Tissue Disease/Scleroderma.   I guess my confusion lies in the fact that I am already in the early stages of C.O.P.D. and I have mild pulmonary hypertension, so how concerned should I be about these nodules?  Could the autoimmune diseases be attacking my lungs or should I be concerned about the possibility of cancer?

							Two Scandinavian studies have provided further evidence that environmental factors could be affecting men's reproductive health. The studies, published online in Europe's leading reproductive medicine journal Human Reproduction, suggest that environmental pollutants could be changing the ratio of sperm carrying the X or Y (sex determining) chromosomes and that they could be contributing towards male reproductive disorders.

As advances in the detection, diagnosis and treatment of cancer have increased, you may have discovered more opportunities to learn the facts about this disease. Yet some misleading ideas about cancer and cancer treatment still persist. Timothy Moynihan, M.D., a cancer specialist at Mayo Clinic, Rochester, Minn., helps debunk some of the most common misconceptions and explains the truth about them.

A positive attitude is all you need to beat cancer.

Although many popular books on cancer talk about fighters and optimists, there's no scientific proof that a positive attitude gives you an advantage in cancer treatment or improves your chance of being cured.


What a positive attitude can do is improve the quality of your life during cancer treatment and beyond. You may be more likely to stay active, maintain ties to family and friends, and continue social activities. In turn, this may enhance your feeling of well-being and help you find the strength to deal with your cancer. A positive attitude may also help you become a more informed and active partner with your doctor during cancer treatment.

If we can put a man on the moon, we should have a cure for cancer by now.

Cancer actually includes a large group of diseases. Each can be caused by many different factors. Despite advances in diagnosis and treatment, doctors still have much to learn about what triggers a cell to become cancerous and why some people with cancer do better than others.

In addition, cancer is a moving target. Cancer cells may continue to mutate and change during the course of the disease. This may lead to the cancer cells no longer responding to the chemotherapy drugs or radiation treatments that were initially given.

Finding the cure for all cancer is, in fact, proving to be more complex than mastering the engineering and physics required for spaceflight.

Drug companies and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) are blocking or withholding new cancer treatments.

Going through cancer treatment is never easy. Even when things are going well, it's natural to become frustrated and wish for a magic bullet to cure your cancer. You might even wonder if such a treatment is available but being withheld.

That's not the case. Your doctor and the FDA, which must approve new drugs before they can be marketed, are your allies. As such, they make your safety a high priority. Unfortunately, scientific studies to determine a cancer treatment's safety and effectiveness take time. That may create the appearance or lead to reports that effective new treatments are being blocked. However, the thorough testing required has kept many unsafe and ineffective drugs from being used in the United States.

Hiding or withholding an important treatment advance would be difficult because the public has many ways to access medical information. In addition to verbal, print, video and electronic means, you may even gain access to information about experimental treatments by participating in a clinical trial.

If you still believe a cure is purposefully being withheld, ask yourself why a doctor may choose to specialize in cancer research. Oftentimes doctors go into cancer research because they have a family member or friend affected by the disease. They're just as interested in finding a cure as anyone else, for exactly the same reason ? it affects them personally. They hate to see a loved one in pain and don't wish to lose this person. They also want to spare others what they have gone through.

As to suggestions that organizations keep cures a secret because they would otherwise lose their source of funding, human nature makes this scenario highly unlikely. It is indeed an unusual human being who would pass up the prestige associated with finding a cure in order to keep funds flowing to a research organization.

Regular checkups and today's medical technology can detect all cancer early.

Routine screening has clearly led to an impressive decrease in deaths from several cancers, including cervix, breast and colon cancers. Although regular medical care can indeed increase your ability to detect cancer early, it can't guarantee it. Cancer is a complicated disease, and there's no sure way to always spot it. Cancer cells can grow anywhere in your body ? often deep within it. Until the cancer reaches a certain size, there isn't a technology or an exam capable of detecting it. By the time you can feel a breast cancer lump, for instance, the cancer may have been there four to six years. Scientists are looking for tests capable of detecting cancers even earlier, but these tests are experimental and have not yet been proved effective.

Undergoing cancer treatment means you can't live at home and can't work or lead a normal life.

Most people with cancer are treated on an outpatient basis in their home community. At times it may be helpful to travel to a specialty medical center for treatment. But often, doctors at such a medical center can work with doctors in your hometown so that you can be with your family and friends and perhaps even resume work. In fact, many people do work full or part time during their treatment. A great deal of time and effort has gone into making it easier for people to live a more normal life during and after their treatment. For example, drugs are now available to help better control nausea. The result is you're often able to work and stay active during your treatment.

Cancer is always painful.

Some cancers never cause pain. Many advanced cancers certainly do cause pain, but over the past five to 10 years, doctors have become more aware of the need to control such pain and have learned better ways to manage it. Many newer pain medications are available to keep you comfortable, and strong pain medication is no longer withheld for fear you'll become addicted. Although all pain may not be eliminated, it may be controlled to the point at which it has little to no impact on your day-to-day living.

Exposing a tumor to air during surgery causes cancer to spread.

Surgery is one of medicine's main weapons against cancer. It can't cause cancer or cause it to spread. Because you may feel worse during your recovery than you did before surgery, you might believe your surgery caused your cancer to spread. However, ""air hitting the tumor"" doesn't cause cancer to spread. In some animal studies, removing the main tumor mass sometimes temporarily facilitates growth of cancer that has already spread (metastasized), but this hasn't been seen conclusively in humans.

Some tumors will grow to a certain size and become relatively dormant. This occurs if the tumors secrete a substance called endostatin, which suppresses tumor growth in both the primary tumor as well as in distant sites.

Unfortunately all tumors, no matter what their size, secrete angiostatin, which promotes tumor growth ? particularly the growth of new blood vessels that supply oxygen and nutrients to the tumor. Therefore, if you have a large primary tumor and only microscopic metastases, the endostatin produced by the large tumor may prevent the metastases from growing. But if you remove the tumor, you remove the source of the growth-inhibiting endostatin, and the metastases, which produce angiostatin, may continue to grow.

Although it's possible that during surgery your doctor may find the cancer more widespread than previously thought, an operation can't cause cancer to spread nor can it cause cancer to start. Don't delay or refuse treatment because of this myth. Surgically removing a cancer is often the first and most important treatment.

Everyone with the same kind of cancer gets the same treatment.

Your doctor tailors your treatment to you. What treatment you receive depends on where your cancer is, whether or how much it has spread, and how it's affecting your body functions and general health.

In addition, cells from the same type of cancer may have different features in different people. These differences can affect how the cells respond to treatment, which in turn may influence your doctor's recommendations.

Good people don't get cancer.

In ancient times illness was often viewed as punishment for bad actions or thoughts. In some cultures that view is still held. If this were true, though, how would you explain the 6-month-old or the newborn who gets cancer? These little ones haven't been bad. There's absolutely no evidence that you get cancer because you deserve it.

Cancer is contagious.

There's no need to avoid someone who has cancer. You can't catch it. It's OK to touch and spend time with someone who has cancer. In fact, your support may never be more valuable.

Though cancer itself isn't contagious, sometimes viruses, which are contagious, can lead to the development of cancer. Two common cancers caused by viruses are cervical cancer and liver cancer. Human papillomavirus (HPV) ? a sexually transmitted disease ? can cause cervical cancer. And hepatitis C ? a virus transmitted through sexual intercourse or infected intravenous (IV) needles ? can cause liver cancer, though only a small number of those with the virus will develop liver cancer.
